## Exploring Character Networks Across English Translations of the Odyssey

Welcome to the digital home of "Homer's Living Network," a digital humanities project analyzing how character relationships in Homer's Odyssey have been reimagined across centuries of English translations.

## Project Overview

This research traces the evolution of Homeric character networks from the first English translation in 1615 to contemporary renderings, using computational methods to reveal how translators have transformed the social landscape of ancient epic for English-speaking audiences.

By combining network analysis and data science with traditional philology and literary history, we uncover patterns in how cultural priorities, gender perspectives, and literary movements have shaped our understanding of Homer's world.

## About the Project

This research is being conducted as part of a dissertation at the University of TÃ¼bingen, combining approaches from computational linguistics, classical reception studies, and translation theory.

The project aims to demonstrate how computational methods can reveal patterns in translation history that might otherwise remain invisible, while contributing to our understanding of how ancient texts live and transform across linguistic and cultural boundaries.
