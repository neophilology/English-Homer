      "from his homeland, longs now for death. But your own heart\n",

      "90\n",
      "a strong case to the suitors, who without cease slaughter\n",
      "his flocks of sheep and his shambling, crumple-horned cattle;\n",
      "and then I’ll send him to Sparta and sandy Pylos, to seek\n",

      "immortal, golden, that bore her both over the sea\n",
      "and across the boundless earth, as swift as the wind’s blast;\n",
      "and she took her brave spear, so massive, thick and strong,\n",
      "its tip of sharp bronze, with which she routs the ranks of men,\n",
      "100\n",
      "heroes against whom she, a strong sire’s daughter, is wroth,\n",
      "and took off, down from the heights of Olympos, landing\n",
      "on Ithákē, right before Odysseus’ outer entrance,\n",
      "his courtyard’s threshold, still grasping the bronze spear,\n",
      "in the guise of a stranger, the Taphian leader Mentēs.\n",
      "105\n",
      "There she found the bold suitors. They at the time\n",
      "were amusing themselves with board games out of doors,\n",
      "seated on hides of oxen they themselves had slaughtered,\n",
      "while heralds and henchmen were busy on their behalf,\n",
      "some mixing wine and water for them in bowls,\n",
      "110\n",
      "while others were swabbing the tables with porous sponges\n",
      "and setting them out, or carving meat in lavish helpings.\n",
      "By far the first to see her was godlike Tēlemachos,\n",
      "who was sitting among the suitors, sorely vexed at heart,\n",
      "in his mind’s eye seeing his noble father, how he might\n",
      "115\n",
      "return, make a scattering of the suitors through his domain,\n",
      "and himself gain honor, be king of his own possessions.\n",
      "Thinking thus, there among the suitors, he noticed Athēnē,\n",
      "and went at once to the forecourt, embarrassed at heart\n",
      "that a guest had to wait outside. He stood beside her,\n",
      "120\n",
      "clasped her right hand, took charge of the bronze spear,\n",
      "and addressed her with winged words, saying: “Greetings, stranger!\n",
      "As a guest you’re welcome among us, and afterwards, when\n",
      "you’ve shared our meal, then explain to us what it is you need.”\n",
      "That said, he led the way, and Pallas Athēnē followed.\n",
      "125\n",
      "When they entered the lofty house, Tēlemachos carried\n",
      "her spear across and stood it beside a tall pillar, in\n",
      "a polished spear rack, where many more spears were standing,\n",
      "that belonged to steadfast Odysseus. Athēnē herself\n",
      "he led and had sit down in a backed chair, spreading\n",
      "130\n",
      "a cloth on it first: a finely wrought chair, with footstool,\n",
      "and beside it an inlaid seat for himself, away from the others,\n",
      "the suitors, lest his guest, irritated by their uproar,\n",
      "should be put off his food, among such arrogant men—\n",
      "and besides, he wanted to ask him about his absent father.\n",
      "135\n",
      "Then a handmaid brought water for them in an exquisite\n",
      "golden pitcher, poured it into a silver basin, so they\n",
      "could rinse their hands, then set a polished table beside them,\n",
      "and a grave housekeeper brought them bread, and with it\n",
      "appetizers galore, giving freely of what was to hand,\n",
      "140\n",
      "while a carver made up and sent them platefuls of meat\n",
      "of every kind, and set by them golden goblets, while\n",
      "a herald went to and fro to furnish them with wine.\n",
      "Then in came the arrogant suitors, and all immediately\n",
      "settled themselves in rows on the seats and benches,\n",
      "145\n",
      "and heralds now poured water over their hands, while maids\n",
      "brought them bread by the basketful, and youths\n",
      "filled the bowls to the brim with drink for them, and they\n",
      "reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\n",
      "But when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "150\n",
      "the suitors’ minds now turned to other pleasures,\n",
      "to singing and dancing, a feast’s proper complement,\n",
      "and a herald brought out for Phēmios his well-tuned lyre—\n",
      "he sang for the suitors only because he was forced to—\n",
      "and he struck a chord, introducing his own fine song.\n",
      "155\n",
      "But Tēlemachos now spoke to grey-eyed Athēnē, leaning\n",
      "his head close to hers, so that no one else could hear him:\n",
      "“Dear stranger, would you be shocked by what I tell you?\n",
      "All these men care about is music and singing, easy enough\n",
      "for them—they’re freeloading off another man’s livelihood,\n",
      "160\n",
      "a man whose white bones may be rotting in the rain\n",
      "away on the mainland, or rolled by the sea’s breakers.\n",
      "If they were to see him, if he ever returned to Ithákē,\n",
      "they’d all be praying that they could run away faster, not\n",
      "as now, that they were richer in gold and expensive clothes!\n",
      "165\n",
      "But no, he must have suffered a wretched fate, nor is there\n",
      "any comfort for us, not even should someone, somewhere,\n",
      "claim he’ll come back: his day of returning’s perished.\n",
      "But now tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\n",
      "Who are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\n",
      "170\n",
      "On what kind of ship did you come here? How did sailors\n",
      "bring you to Ithákē? What place do they say they’re from?\n",
      "For I don’t imagine you made your way here on foot!\n",
      "And tell me this truly too, that I may be certain of it:\n",
      "Is this your first visit here, or are you one of my father’s\n",
      "175\n",
      "guest-friends? Many the men who used to visit our home,\n",
      "just as he too traveled widely among mankind.”\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“So, I’ll answer the questions you asked me fully and truthfully.\n",
      "I declare I am Mentēs, wise Anchialos’ son,\n",
      "180\n",
      "and that I rule the Taphians, master rowers; and now,\n",
      "as you see, I’ve put in here by ship, with my companions,\n",
      "sailing the wine-dark deep to meet men of foreign speech,\n",
      "on my way to Temésē for copper, with a cargo of gleaming iron.\n",
      "My ship’s out there, by the countryside, far from the city,\n",
      "185\n",
      "in the harbor of Rheithron, down below wooded Nēion.\n",
      "Guest-friends of each other Odysseus and I claim we are\n",
      "from way back—you can go ask that elderly hero\n",
      "Laërtēs, who, they say, no longer comes to the city,\n",
      "but far away in the backwoods has a hard existence\n",
      "190\n",
      "with one old woman servant, who sees to his victuals and drink\n",
      "when exhaustion steals over and weakens his limbs as he\n",
      "shuffles along the high slope of his patch of vineyard.\n",
      "So now I’ve come, for indeed word had it that your father\n",
      "was back home; but the gods must be thwarting his return,\n",
      "195\n",
      "since not yet has he died in this world, the noble Odysseus,\n",
      "but still lives, perhaps held prisoner, out on the vast deep\n",
      "in some sea-girt island, kept there by violent men,\n",
      "wild savages, who, most likely, are holding him under duress.\n",
      "But I shall now make a prediction for you, just as the immortals\n",
      "200\n",
      "put it into my mind—and I think it will come to pass,\n",
      "though I am no seer, have no clear knowledge of bird-signs!\n",
      "Not much longer will he be away from his own beloved\n",
      "country, no, not even if iron bonds restrain him—he’ll\n",
      "find a way to return, this man of many resources!\n",
      "205\n",
      "But now tell me this, and declare it to me truly,\n",
      "if indeed, big as you are, you’re Odysseus’ own son—because\n",
      "your head and fine eyes bear an amazing resemblance\n",
      "to his: many the hours we spent with one another\n",
      "before he embarked for Troy, like so many others,\n",
      "210\n",
      "the finest of the Achaians, in the hollow ships, and set forth.\n",
      "But since then I’ve not seen Odysseus, nor he me.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“So, stranger, I’ll give you a full and truthful answer.\n",
      "My mother says I’m his child, but for my own part\n",
      "215\n",
      "I cannot tell: never yet did any man know his begetting!\n",
      "Indeed, I could wish I’d been the son of some fortunate\n",
      "gentleman, taken by age while among his own possessions!\n",
      "But truth is, it was the most ill-fated of mortals who,\n",
      "so they say, begot me—since you’re asking about this matter.”\n",
      "220\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“No nameless lineage, surely, did the gods decree for you\n",
      "hereafter, since such as you are you were born to Penelopē!\n",
      "But now tell me this, and declare it to me truly:\n",
      "What party, what gathering’s this? What’s your concern with it?\n",
      "225\n",
      "A feast, is it? Or a wedding? No communal dinner, surely?\n",
      "The riotous, arrogant manner in which, as it seems to me,\n",
      "they are carrying on in your house! A man might well take offense,\n",
      "walking in on this shameful behavior—any decent man, that is.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "230\n",
      "“Since, stranger, you ask this, and question me on these matters,\n",
      "our household once looked to be rich and respectable,\n",
      "so long as that certain man was here among his people;\n",
      "but now the gods have willed otherwise, have planned misfortune,\n",
      "have vanished him utterly, as they’ve done to no other man\n",
      "235\n",
      "ever—I wouldn’t be grieving so over his death\n",
      "had he fallen alongside his comrades upon Trojan soil\n",
      "or expired in his friends’ arms after winding up the war!\n",
      "Then all the Achaians would have made him a burial mound,\n",
      "and great glory would have been his, and his son’s, hereafter.\n",
      "240\n",
      "But now, ingloriously, the storm winds have swept him away.\n",
      "He’s gone, out of sight, out of knowledge, leaving me pain and sorrow\n",
      "—and it’s not on his sole account that I’m lamenting now,\n",
      "since the gods have inflicted other harsh troubles on me.\n",
      "All those highborn leaders who lord it over the islands—\n",
      "245\n",
      "Doulichion and Samē and forested Zákynthos,\n",
      "besides those who rule as princes over rocky Ithákē—\n",
      "are all paying court to my mother, and devouring our property.\n",
      "Yet she neither refuses this hateful marriage, nor can she make\n",
      "an end of the business, while they with feasting keep on\n",
      "250\n",
      "eating away our substance: very soon they’ll destroy me too.”\n",
      "Outraged by his statement, Athēnē responded, saying:\n",
      "“It’s true, you’re in urgent need of the vanished Odysseus,\n",
      "to come and lay hands on these shameless suitors!\n",
      "How I wish he’d appear now, here at your outer gate,\n",
      "255\n",
      "armed with helmet and shield and a brace of spears,\n",
      "the way he was the first time I set eyes upon him,\n",
      "in our house, drinking wine and enjoying himself, on his way\n",
      "back from Ephyrē, where he’d gone to see Ilos, Mermeros’ son.\n",
      "Odysseus had voyaged there aboard his speedy vessel\n",
      "260\n",
      "in search of a lethal poison that he wanted to get\n",
      "to smear the bronze tips of his arrows. But Ilos refused\n",
      "to give it him, fearing the wrath of the gods that are forever;\n",
      "yet my father did, for he loved the man most dearly.\n",
      "If only Odysseus might come, thus arrayed, among the suitors!\n",
      "265\n",
      "They’d all find a quick death then, and a bitter marriage.\n",
      "But of course all this rests on the knees of the gods—\n",
      "whether or not he’ll return and exact full retribution\n",
      "in his own halls. But I urge you yourself to consider\n",
      "how you might drive out these suitors from your household,\n",
      "270\n",
      "so pay attention now, mark carefully what I tell you.\n",
      "Tomorrow call an assembly of the Achaian heroes:\n",
      "Speak your mind to them all, let the gods be your witnesses!\n",
      "Tell the suitors all to disperse, to go back home;\n",
      "And if your mother’s heart is urging her toward marriage,\n",
      "275\n",
      "she should return to her powerful father’s domain,\n",
      "where they’ll set up the wedding and arrange the bride-gifts,\n",
      "lots of them, all that’s fitting to go with a much-loved daughter.\n",
      "And for you yourself wise advice, if you’ll take it: man a ship,\n",
      "the best you have, with twenty rowers, and go\n",
      "280\n",
      "to seek news of your father, who’s been so long absent,\n",
      "just in case some person can tell you, or you pick up a rumor\n",
      "from Zeus, the most common way that mortals gather tidings.\n",
      "Go first to Pylos, interrogate noble Nestōr,\n",
      "and from there to Sparta, to fair-haired Menelaös,\n",
      "285\n",
      "for he was the last of all the bronze-corseleted Achaians\n",
      "to get home. If you hear that your father’s alive, and on his\n",
      "way back, then, though beleaguered, hold on for another year;\n",
      "but if you get word that he’s dead, no longer living,\n",
      "then make your way back to your own dear country,\n",
      "290\n",
      "raise him a burial mound, perform funeral rites at it—\n",
      "lavish ones, as is fitting—and find your mother a husband.\n",
      "Then, when all this business is over and done with,\n",
      "is the time to consider, in your mind and spirit,\n",
      "how you might slaughter these suitors in your halls,\n",
      "295\n",
      "whether by guile or openly. It does not become you\n",
      "to persist in childish ways: you’re no longer a child.\n",
      "Or have you not heard what glory noble Orestēs won\n",
      "among all mankind when he slew his father’s murderer,\n",
      "crafty Aigisthos, for killing his famous father?\n",
      "300\n",
      "You too, my friend—for I see how handsome and tall you are—\n",
      "be valiant, that men yet unborn may speak well of you!\n",
      "But now I shall go back down to my swift ship,\n",
      "where my comrades must be waiting impatiently for me.\n",
      "So think on these things, and pay heed to what I’ve told you.”\n",
      "305\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, the words that you said were spoken considerately,\n",
      "as a father would speak to his son: I will never forget them.\n",
      "But please do stay longer, though eager to be on your way,\n",
      "so that when you’ve had a bath and refreshed your spirit\n",
      "310\n",
      "you can go to your ship with a present, happy at heart—\n",
      "an expensive and beautiful gift, to be an heirloom for you\n",
      "from me, such as guest-friends exchange with one another.”\n",
      "The goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Delay me no longer—I need to resume my journey:\n",
      "315\n",
      "and whatever gift your heart incites you to give me,\n",
      "give it me when I return here, to take back home. And choose\n",
      "something really precious: it’ll bring you its worth in exchange.”\n",
      "That said, the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, departed,\n",
      "flying up through the skylight. Into his heart she set\n",
      "320\n",
      "courage and strength, and put him in mind of his father\n",
      "even more than before. Reflecting on what had happened\n",
      "his mind was in awe: this must be a god, he thought.\n",
      "At once he approached the suitors, a godlike mortal.\n",
      "For them the far-famed minstrel was singing, and they\n",
      "325\n",
      "sat listening in silence. His song recounted the Achaians’\n",
      "wretched homecoming from Troy, laid on them by Athēnē.\n",
      "From upstairs the marvelous tale was heard and pondered\n",
      "by Ikarios’ daughter, the prudent Penelopē, who now\n",
      "went down from her high bright upper chamber: not\n",
      "330\n",
      "alone, for two of her handmaids followed in attendance.\n",
      "When she, bright among women, came where the suitors were,\n",
      "she stood by the central post of the snugly timbered roof,\n",
      "holding up her shining veil in front of her face,\n",
      "and flanked on either side by a devoted handmaid,\n",
      "335\n",
      "and then, in tears, addressed the godlike minstrel:\n",
      "“Phēmios, much else you know to keep mortals spellbound—\n",
      "deeds of men and of gods, made famous by minstrels:\n",
      "give them one such song as you sit here, let them in silence\n",
      "still drink their wine, but quit this lay you’re singing,\n",
      "340\n",
      "so unhappy, it always agonizes the heart in my breast,\n",
      "since on me beyond all others has come unforgettable\n",
      "grief, for that much-loved being I picture with such longing—\n",
      "my husband, of wide renown through Hellas and mid-Argos.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "345\n",
      "“Mother, why do you begrudge so excellent a minstrel\n",
      "the right to please in whatever way he chooses?\n",
      "It’s not minstrels who are at fault, but Zeus, who deals out\n",
      "to bread-eating mortals whatever he likes for each.\n",
      "Don’t blame this bard for singing the Danaäns’ grim fate:\n",
      "350\n",
      "men always show most enthusiasm for the newest lay\n",
      "that’s performed with a view to enchant their listening ears!\n",
      "So harden your mind and heart, be resigned to listen:\n",
      "It was not Odysseus alone who lost his day of returning\n",
      "from Troy—many others perished, just as he did.\n",
      "355\n",
      "So go back to your room, get down to your regular tasks,\n",
      "at the loom, with the distaff; see to it that your handmaids\n",
      "do their proper work too! But speechmaking is men’s business,\n",
      "and mine above all, since mine is the power in this household.”\n",
      "Taken aback, Penelopē now withdrew to her chamber,\n",
      "360\n",
      "and stored in her heart her son’s smart observations.\n",
      "Upstairs she went, her handmaids with her, and then\n",
      "wept for Odysseus, her own dear husband, until\n",
      "grey-eyed Athēnē spread sweet sleep over her eyelids.\n",
      "But the suitors created an uproar throughout the shadowy hall,\n",
      "365\n",
      "each praying that he might be the one to bed and lie with her,\n",
      "and among them sagacious Tēlemachos was the first to speak:\n",
      "“You, my mother’s suitors, domineering and arrogant,\n",
      "for now let us feast and enjoy ourselves, but please,\n",
      "no shouting! It’s a rare pleasure to be able to hear\n",
      "370\n",
      "a minstrel like this one, with a voice like that of the gods!\n",
      "But tomorrow at dawn let’s go and be seated in assembly,\n",
      "all of us, where I’ll make you a forthright public request:\n",
      "Get out of my home! Go find other feasts for yourselves,\n",
      "consume your own goods, move around from house to house!\n",
      "375\n",
      "But if this is what you regard as better, more profitable,\n",
      "to devour one man’s livelihood without offering compensation,\n",
      "then gobble on! I’ll petition the gods who are forever,\n",
      "and maybe Zeus will grant me an occasion of reprisal,\n",
      "so that you, while still feasting for free in my halls, all perish!”\n",
      "380\n",
      "So he spoke; and all of them bit their lips hard, astonished\n",
      "at the way Tēlemachos had spoken out so boldly.\n",
      "Antinoös, son of Eupeithēs, now addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, it must be the gods themselves who’ve taught you\n",
      "this high-flown delivery, this audacious way of speaking!\n",
      "385\n",
      "You, king of sea-girt Ithákē? May the son of Kronos never\n",
      "grant you the throne, though it’s yours by ancestral right!”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Antinoös, what I now say may perhaps offend you.\n",
      "This too I’d be glad to accept, were Zeus the giver:\n",
      "390\n",
      "do you think it the worst fate that could befall a man?\n",
      "To be king’s no disaster: right from the start your domain\n",
      "Is enriched, and you yourself are held in greater honor.\n",
      "Still, there are many other princes of the Achaians,\n",
      "both young and old, who dwell here in sea-girt Ithákē:\n",
      "395\n",
      "any one of them might get this, since noble Odysseus\n",
      "is dead. But I shall be lord over our own household,\n",
      "and the servants that noble Odysseus got as booty for me.”\n",
      "Then Eurymachos, son of Polybos, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, all these matters rest on the knees of the gods—\n",
      "400\n",
      "like, which of the Achaians will be king in sea-girt Ithákē!\n",
      "So keep your possessions, lord it over your own household,\n",
      "and may the man never come here who’d deprive you by force\n",
      "of your possessions, as long as Ithákē’s inhabited! Yet\n",
      "I’d like, my good friend, to ask you about that stranger—\n",
      "405\n",
      "Where did he come from? What country does he claim as his?\n",
      "Where are his relatives, his family acres, to be found?\n",
      "Did he come here with news about your father’s return,\n",
      "or was it just to take care of some business of his own?\n",
      "The way he took off and vanished, not even waiting\n",
      "410\n",
      "to meet us—he didn’t look, though, like some common fellow.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Eurymachos, by now all hope for my father’s return\n",
      "has perished. No longer do I trust rumors from any source,\n",
      "or give any heed to prophecies, such as my mother\n",
      "415\n",
      "might pick up from a seer that she’d invited home.\n",
      "As for this stranger, he’s from Taphos, a friend\n",
      "of my father, he says, named Mentēs, wise Anchialos’ son,\n",
      "and is lord of the Taphians, those master rowers.”\n",
      "So spoke\n",
      "Tēlemachos; but in his heart he knew the immortal goddess.\n",
      "420\n",
      "The suitors now turned to dancing and the pleasures of song,\n",
      "pursuing their revels until it was evening: only darkness\n",
      "interrupted their merrymaking, only then\n",
      "did each of them slope off homeward to take his rest.\n",
      "But Tēlemachos made his way to the handsome courtyard,\n",
      "425\n",
      "in a sheltering corner of which his chamber had been built,\n",
      "and sought his bed there, pondering much in his mind,\n",
      "escorted by his old nurse, who bore the lighted torches—\n",
      "faithful Eurykleia, daughter of Ōps, Peisēnōr’s son.\n",
      "Long ago she’d been bought by Laërtēs, at a good price,\n",
      "430\n",
      "when she was still a young girl: twenty oxen, no less.\n",
      "He respected her in his home no less than his loyal wife,\n",
      "but never made love to her, for fear of his wife’s anger.\n",
      "So now it was she who carried the lighted torches: of all\n",
      "the servants she loved him most, had nursed him as a child.\n",
      "435\n",
      "He opened the door of his well-carpentered chamber,\n",
      "sat down on the bed and took off his soft tunic,\n",
      "then placed it in the hands of this wise old woman, who\n",
      "now folded and smoothed the tunic, hung it up\n",
      "on a peg at the side of the corded bedstead, and went\n",
      "440\n",
      "out of the chamber, pulled the door shut behind her\n",
      "with its silver hook, and drew the bolt home by its thong.\n",
      "So the whole night through, wrapped in a woolen blanket,\n",
      "he brooded over the journey Athēnē had planned for him.\n",
      "Book 2\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "Odysseus’ dear son got up from the bed he’d slept in,\n",
      "put on his clothes, slung a sharp sword from one shoulder,\n",
      "tied on a pair of fine sandals under his sleek feet,\n",
      "and sallied forth from his chamber, in appearance like a god.\n",
      "5\n",
      "At once he issued orders to the clear-voiced heralds\n",
      "to call to assembly the long-haired Achaians.1 They made\n",
      "the proclamation he ordered, and quickly the people gathered.\n",
      "When they were met together in a single body\n",
      "Tēlemachos now joined them, a bronze spear in one hand,\n",
      "10\n",
      "not alone, but accompanied by a pair of hunting dogs,\n",
      "and wondrous the grace that Athēnē now shed on him,\n",
      "so that the whole crowd watched him as he approached:\n",
      "he sat in his father’s seat, and the elders made way for him.\n",
      "The hero Aigyptios was the first among them to speak,\n",
      "15\n",
      "a man bent with age, of much varied experience.\n",
      "Besides, his dear son had accompanied godlike Odysseus\n",
      "to Ilion, rich in fine foals, aboard the hollow ships—\n",
      "the spearman Antiphos: but the savage Kyklōps had killed him\n",
      "in his hollow cave, the last of the crew to be eaten.\n",
      "20\n",
      "He had three other sons. One, Eurynomos, joined the suitors;\n",
      "the remaining two looked after the family farmlands. And yet,\n",
      "grieving and sorrowful, he couldn’t forget the lost one.\n",
      "It was in tears for him that he now addressed the assembly:\n",
      "“Pay attention, men of Ithákē, to what I shall now tell you!\n",
      "25\n",
      "Not once have we met in assembly, there’s been no session\n",
      "since noble Odysseus set sail in the hollow ships!\n",
      "Who, then, has summoned us now? What urgent need\n",
      "has come upon one of our men, whether younger or older?\n",
      "Has he had some news about an impending attack\n",
      "30\n",
      "that he can explain to us, having heard it earlier?\n",
      "Or will he announce for debate some other public business?\n",
      "A fine man I think him, and blessed: may Zeus grant\n",
      "a good fulfillment of whatever his heart desires.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and Odysseus’ dear son rejoiced at the omen,\n",
      "35\n",
      "nor remained seated longer, in his urgency to speak,\n",
      "but stood up in mid-assembly, while the scepter was placed\n",
      "in his hands by the herald Peisēnōr, a man astute in counsel;\n",
      "and then he spoke, first addressing the old man:\n",
      "“Old sir, the man’s not far, as you’ll soon learn yourself:\n",
      "40\n",
      "It was I who summoned the people: this grief affects me most.\n",
      "I’ve had no news of any impending attack\n",
      "that I can explain to you, having heard of it earlier;\n",
      "nor shall I announce for debate any other public business,\n",
      "but rather my own needs, because of the double evil\n",
      "45\n",
      "that’s befallen my house: I’ve lost my noble father, who once\n",
      "was king among you here, as gentle as any father;\n",
      "and now there’s a far worse plague, that will very soon\n",
      "destroy my house altogether, consume my whole livelihood!\n",
      "My mother, against her will, is being pestered by suitors,\n",
      "50\n",
      "the sons of those very men who are the noblest here!\n",
      "They shudder at the idea of going rather to the house\n",
      "of her father, Ikarios, have him fix his daughter’s bride-gifts\n",
      "and betroth her to whom he will, to the man that he prefers;\n",
      "instead, day in day out, they crowd into our house,\n",
      "55\n",
      "slaughter our oxen and sheep, our fattest goats,\n",
      "hold an endless party, swill down our sparkling wine\n",
      "without restraint. Much is lost already, there’s no man\n",
      "such as Odysseus was, to save our house from ruin—\n",
      "we ourselves lack the strength to defend it: in the event\n",
      "60\n",
      "we’d be shown up as wretched weaklings, unversed in prowess.\n",
      "Yet indeed I’d defend myself, if the strength was in me,\n",
      "for deeds not to be borne have been done, there’s nothing decent\n",
      "in the way my estate’s been destroyed! You should feel ashamed,\n",
      "embarrassed before the men in your neighborhood,\n",
      "65\n",
      "those who live near here! And beware of the gods’ wrath,\n",
      "lest outraged by evil actions they turn against you!\n",
      "By Olympian Zeus I beseech you, and by Themis,\n",
      "who both dissolves and convenes our mortal assemblies,\n",
      "forbear, my friends, leave me alone to pine away in bitter\n",
      "70\n",
      "sorrow—unless it could be that my father, noble Odysseus,\n",
      "at some point in anger mistreated the well-greaved Achaians,\n",
      "and now you, in angry requital, are mistreating me by urging\n",
      "these suitors on? For me it would be better by far\n",
      "were you yourselves to consume my property and my cattle,\n",
      "75\n",
      "because, if you did the eating, there might some day\n",
      "be recompense—we’d hawk the story round town,\n",
      "demanding back our possessions, till all were restored.\n",
      "But this way you burden my heart with incurable agony.”\n",
      "So he spoke in his anger, then threw down the scepter,\n",
      "80\n",
      "and burst into tears. Now pity took hold of all the people.\n",
      "All others kept silent; no one could bring himself\n",
      "to offer an angry rebuttal to Tēlemachos’ words:\n",
      "only Antinoös replied to him, saying: “Tēlemachos,\n",
      "lofty orator, angry, outspoken—what is this charge\n",
      "85\n",
      "you’re trying to shame us with, put the blame on us?\n",
      "It’s not the Achaian suitors who are guilty in your regard\n",
      "but rather your own dear mother, so expert at deceit!\n",
      "For it’s three years now, and will soon be four, she’s spent\n",
      "toying with the passions in the Achaians’ hearts,\n",
      "90\n",
      "offering hope to all, making promises to each one,\n",
      "and sending them messages, but herself planning otherwise.\n",
      "And here’s one other deception that she contrived:\n",
      "in her halls she set up a great loom and started weaving—\n",
      "very broad was the web, fine of thread—and said to us then:\n",
      "95\n",
      "‘You young men, my suitors now noble Odysseus is dead,\n",
      "be patient, though eager to wed me, until I finish\n",
      "this web: I should not want my woven work to be wasted—\n",
      "a shroud for the hero Laërtēs, against that day\n",
      "when the grim fate of pitiless death shall overtake him:\n",

      "then the local Achaian women won’t be able to blame me\n",
      "for a man who’d won so much being left with no winding-sheet.’\n",
      "“So she spoke; and our proud hearts assented to what she said.\n",
      "From then on, day after day, she’d be weaving at the great loom,\n",
      "but at night she’d have torches set up, and undo her work.\n",
      "105\n",
      "Thus for three years she beguiled and persuaded the Achaians;\n",
      "but when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round,\n",
      "then it was that one of her women, well aware of what she did,\n",
      "told us, and so we caught her undoing her elegant web,\n",
      "and against her will she was forced to finish it. Thus\n",
      "110\n",
      "this is the suitors’ response to you, to the end that you\n",
      "and all the Achaians may have clear knowledge of it:\n",
      "send your mother away, tell her to make a marriage\n",
      "with whoever her father selects and whom she fancies!\n",

      "115\n",
      "exploiting with forethought those talents Athēnē gave her—\n",
      "expertise in fine handiwork, outstanding intelligence and\n",
      "sagacity, such as we’ve never yet heard ascribed\n",
      "to women of old, those fair-tressed Achaian ladies\n",
      "Tyrō, Alkmēnē, and garlanded Mykēnē,\n",
      "120\n",
      "not one of whom for shrewd planning could rival Penelopē2—\n",
      "then at least in this matter she made a wrong decision,\n",
      "and they’ll go on devouring your livelihood and your stock\n",
      "so long as she holds to this purpose that the gods\n",
      "have now put into her heart. She may be winning great fame\n",
      "125\n",

      "As for us, we’ll not disperse to our homes or anywhere else\n",
      "until she decides to wed whichever Achaian she picks.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos replied as follows: “Antinoös,\n",
      "I can’t just drive from this house—against her will—\n",
      "130\n",
      "her who bore and reared me, while my father, alive or dead,\n",
      "is in some distant country! And to pay a great sum to Ikarios,\n",
      "as I must, if I throw out my mother, would be unfair on me.\n",
      "Thus I’d get a bad deal from her father, besides which heaven\n",
      "would add to my woes, since my mother on leaving our home\n",
      "135\n",
      "would invoke the foul Furies,3 and I’d be an object of public\n",
      "contempt—so this is a word I shall never utter. And you all,\n",
      "if even your hearts are touched by guilt in this matter,\n",
      "get out of my home! Go find other feasts for yourselves,\n",
      "consume your own goods, move around from house to house!\n",
      "140\n",
      "But if this is what you regard as better, more profitable,\n",
      "to devour one man’s livelihood without offering compensation,\n",
      "then gobble on! I’ll petition the gods who are forever,\n",
      "and maybe Zeus will grant me an occasion of reprisal,\n",
      "so that you, while still feasting for free in my halls, all perish!”\n",
      "145\n",
      "So Tēlemachos spoke, and for him far-seeing Zeus\n",
      "sent two eagles flying down from a lofty mountain peak.\n",
      "For a while they glided, riding upon the wind stream,\n",
      "side by side, close together, wings wide outspread; but when\n",
      "they arrived at the midpoint of the many-voiced assembly,\n",
      "150\n",
      "then they circled over it, with a whirr of beating wings,\n",
      "tore each other’s cheeks and necks on both sides with their talons,\n",
      "looking down, with death in their glance, on the heads of the crowd,\n",
      "then sped off to the right, above their homes and city.\n",
      "All were amazed by what they’d witnessed of these birds,\n",
      "155\n",
      "had much heart-searching as to what they might portend,\n",
      "and were now addressed by the aged hero Halithersēs,\n",
      "Mastōr’s son, who excelled all men of his generation\n",
      "in his knowledge of bird-signs and at interpreting omens.\n",
      "He, with friendly intent, now spoke before the assembly:\n",
      "160\n",
      "“Listen well, you men of Ithákē, to what I have to tell you!\n",
      "And the suitors above all should heed the message I bring,\n",
      "for great troubles are rolling toward them, since Odysseus will not\n",
      "be much longer away from his friends: already, I believe,\n",
      "he may well be near, and devising slaughter and death\n",
      "165\n",
      "for them all! And for others in plenty he’ll mean trouble,\n",
      "who dwell in sunny Ithákē! But we should, well beforehand,\n",
      "think of a way to stop them—or have them desist\n",
      "of themselves, since that’s a far better way for them.\n",
      "I’m no novice at prophesying, I have sure knowledge,\n",
      "170\n",
      "and I declare that it’s all now coming true for that man\n",
      "exactly as I foretold when the Argives first sailed\n",
      "for Ilion, and he, resourceful Odysseus, among them.\n",
      "Having suffered much, with all his comrades lost,\n",
      "recognized by nobody, after twenty years, I said,\n",
      "175\n",
      "he’d return home—and now all this is being fulfilled.”\n",
      "Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Old man, go home, and prophesy to your children,\n",
      "lest they suffer some kind of misfortune in the future!\n",
      "For this I’m a far more reliable prophet than you are.\n",
      "180\n",
      "There are birds in plenty that fly to and fro in the daytime,\n",
      "yet not all of them carry omens. As for Odysseus, he’s met\n",
      "a distant death, and you should have perished with him—\n",
      "then you wouldn’t be unloading all these predictions,\n",
      "or lending encouragement to Tēlemachos’ burst of temper,\n",
      "185\n",
      "in the hope that he’ll reward you with a gift to your family!\n",
      "Let me speak plainly—and what I say will come to pass!\n",
      "If you, given all the knowledge that age confers, beguile\n",
      "a younger man with your words, encourage his resentment,\n",
      "first, this will make more trouble for the man himself.\n",
      "190\n",
      "[He won’t get anything done alone, without assistance;]4\n",
      "and on you, old sir, we’ll impose a penalty that your heart\n",
      "will be in torment at paying, and bitter your agony!\n",
      "My own advice to Tēlemachos, before you all, is this:\n",
      "Let him tell his mother to return to her father’s domain,\n",
      "195\n",
      "where they’ll set up the wedding and arrange the bridal-gifts,\n",
      "lots of them, all that’s fitting to go with a much-loved daughter.\n",
      "Failing that, I don’t suppose that the sons of the Achaians\n",
      "will abandon their burdensome wooing, since we fear no man—\n",
      "certainly not Tēlemachos, for all his lengthy rant—\n",
      "200\n",
      "nor shall we heed any predictions that you, old sir, may make:\n",
      "they won’t come true, and you’ll be hated all the more!\n",
      "What’s more, his goods will continue to be devoured, without\n",
      "compensation, so long as she continues to stall\n",
      "the Achaians over her marriage! Here we are, kept waiting\n",
      "205\n",
      "day after day, in rivalry for her virtue, never going\n",
      "after other suitable women, such as each of us might marry.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Eurymachos, and the rest of you, all you noble suitors,\n",
      "over this I’ll entreat you no longer, nor discuss it further,\n",
      "210\n",
      "since by now the gods are aware of it, as are all the Achaians.\n",
      "So give me a swift ship, along with twenty companions\n",
      "as crew on my journey, to both go there and come back.\n",
      "For I’m off to Sparta and sandy Pylos, to enquire for\n",
      "news about the return of my long-absent father.\n",
      "215\n",
      "Maybe some mortal can tell me, or I can pick up a rumor\n",
      "from Zeus, the most common way that mortals gather tidings.\n",
      "If I hear that my father’s alive, and on his way back,\n",
      "then, though beleaguered, I’ll hold on for another year;\n",
      "but if I get word that he’s dead, no longer living,\n",
      "220\n",
      "then I’ll make my way back to my own dear country,\n",
      "raise him a burial mound, perform funeral rites at it—\n",
      "lavish ones, as is fitting—and find my mother a husband.”\n",
      "That said, he sat down, and there now stood up among them\n",
      "Mentōr, who’d been a comrade of peerless Odysseus.\n",
      "225\n",
      "When Odysseus set out with his ships, he left him in charge\n",
      "of his household, under Laërtēs, to safeguard everything.\n",
      "He, with friendly intent, now spoke before the assembly:\n",
      "“Listen well, you men of Ithákē, to what I have to tell you!\n",
      "From now on let no kindness or gentleness be displayed\n",
      "230\n",
      "by a sceptered king, let his heart not cherish what’s righteous—\n",
      "let him rather be ever harsh, pursue injustice, since\n",
      "there’s nobody now who remembers godlike Odysseus\n",
      "of the people whose lord he was, and kindly as a father!\n",
      "It’s not these arrogant suitors I so much resent,\n",
      "235\n",
      "for their violent acts and their nasty-minded misconduct—\n",
      "they risk their own lives by forcibly wolfing down\n",
      "Odysseus’ goods, and saying he’ll never return—\n",
      "no, it’s you, all the rest of the people, that I find fault with,\n",
      "for sitting there silent, not speaking out roundly to stop\n",
      "240\n",
      "these suitors, though they are few, while you are many.”\n",
      "Against him Leokritos, son of Euēnōr, now spoke out:\n",
      "“Mentōr, you mischief-maker, you’re crazy! What’s all this\n",
      "talk about putting us down? It’d be a tough business\n",
      "even for more men than these to clamp down on our feasting!\n",
      "245\n",
      "And what if Odysseus himself, the Ithákan, did return,\n",
      "to find these haughty suitors banqueting in his palace,\n",
      "and resolved in his heart to throw them all out? His wife\n",
      "would get no joy of his homecoming, however deeply\n",
      "she’d missed him: he’d suffer a shameful death on the spot\n",
      "250\n",
      "if he fought outnumbered. Your threats lack reality!\n",
      "And you, good people, disperse now, each to his own affairs;\n",
      "and as for this fellow here, Mentōr and Halithersēs\n",
      "will speed his departure—they’re old friends of his father’s!\n",
      "But myself, I think he’ll just sit around listening to rumors\n",
      "255\n",
      "right here in Ithákē: he’ll never accomplish this journey!”\n",
      "With that, he abruptly dismissed the assembly. They all\n",
      "dispersed at once, each man to his own house, except\n",
      "the suitors, who went off to the house of godlike Odysseus,\n",
      "and Tēlemachos, who withdrew, alone, to the seashore,\n",
      "260\n",
      "washed his hands in the grey salt water, then prayed to Athēnē:\n",
      "“Hear me, you god who came yesterday to our home,\n",
      "and told me to travel by ship across the misty deep\n",
      "to seek news of my long-absent father’s return!\n",
      "Now all my plans are being held up by the Achaians,\n",
      "265\n",
      "and, above all, by these viciously arrogant suitors!”\n",
      "So he spoke in prayer, and Athēnē then approached him,\n",
      "assuming Mentōr’s likeness in both voice and appearance,\n",
      "and addressed him as follows, uttering winged words:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, you’ll turn out neither craven nor witless\n",
      "270\n",
      "if indeed you’ve been imbued with your father’s rare strength—\n",
      "such a man he was, so masterful in both deeds and words!\n",
      "In that case your journey won’t be useless or unfulfilled;\n",
      "but if you’re not his son, his and Penelopē’s, then\n",
      "I have no hope you’ll accomplish what you’re planning.\n",
      "275\n",
      "Few are the sons who prove the equal of their fathers:\n",
      "most are worth less, hardly any prove themselves better.\n",
      "But since it would seem that you are neither craven nor witless,\n",
      "and that Odysseus’ resourcefulness hasn’t passed you over,\n",
      "there is a fair chance that you will bring this business off!\n",
      "280\n",
      "So don’t worry about these suitors’ attitudes and notions—\n",
      "They’re witless creatures, neither sensible nor right-thinking,\n",
      "and wholly unaware of the fact that death and black fate\n",
      "are very near, that on the same day they’ll all perish!\n",
      "But for you that journey you’re planning is not far distant,\n",
      "285\n",
      "so true a companion I am to your father’s family—\n",
      "I’ll fit you out a swift ship, accompany you myself.\n",
      "Now go back to the house, keep company with the suitors,\n",
      "make ready provisions, pack them all in containers:\n",
      "the wine in jars, and the barley meal, men’s marrow,\n",
      "290\n",
      "in stout leather bags. Meanwhile, I’ll go through the town\n",
      "and find you a volunteer crew. As for ships, there are plenty\n",
      "here in sea-girt Ithákē, both old and new: of these\n",
      "I myself will select you the one that best suits your purpose,\n",
      "and we’ll soon fit her out, launch her into the open sea.”\n",
      "295\n",
      "So spoke Zeus’ daughter Athēnē. Tēlemachos did not\n",
      "linger, after he’d heard the voice of the goddess,\n",
      "but made his way back to the house, much troubled at heart,\n",
      "and found the proud suitors already there in his halls,\n",
      "busy flaying goats and singeing fat hogs in the courtyard.\n",
      "300\n",
      "Antinoös, laughing, came over, confronted Tēlemachos,\n",
      "took his hand, and had this to say to him, speaking plainly:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, lofty talker, angry, outspoken—no longer\n",
      "nurse in your heart any evil thoughts or actions,\n",
      "but, please, eat and drink with us, as you did before!\n",
      "305\n",
      "All these things the Achaians will surely provide for you—\n",
      "a vessel and hand-picked oarsmen, to give you a speedy\n",
      "voyage to sacred Pylos, to seek news of your father.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Antinoös, there’s no way I could feast with you arrogant lot\n",
      "310\n",
      "undistracted, much less enjoy myself in comfort!\n",
      "Is it not enough, you suitors, that in the past you devoured\n",
      "so much of my choice possessions, when I was still a child!\n",
      "But now that I’m grown, and can figure the truth from what\n",
      "others tell me, and passion is surging up within me,\n",
      "315\n",
      "I’ll try directing the evil death-spirits against you, either\n",
      "by going to Pylos, or here in this district! But go I will,\n",
      "nor shall the journey I speak of be made in vain,\n",
      "though I’m a passenger, lacking a ship and oarsmen\n",
      "of my own: this, I presume, was how you wanted it.”\n",
      "320\n",
      "That said, he withdrew his hand from the hand of Antinoös,\n",
      "lightly. Meanwhile the suitors, busy preparing dinner\n",
      "about the house, made mock of him to each other,\n",
      "and this is how one of these arrogant youths would talk:\n",
      "“Oh, for sure, Tēlemachos must be planning our murder!\n",
      "325\n",
      "He’ll bring over helpers either from sandy Pylos\n",
      "or maybe from Sparta, he wants it so desperately—\n",
      "or he’s thinking of going to Ephyrē, that rich plowland,\n",
      "to pick up some deadly poisons, bring them back here,\n",
      "drizzle them into the wine bowl, and destroy us all!”\n",
      "330\n",
      "Again, another of these arrogant youths would announce:\n",
      "“Who knows? Maybe he himself, going off in his hollow ship,\n",
      "far from his friends, will die wandering, like Odysseus!\n",
      "That way he’d cause us even more trouble—we’d have\n",
      "to share out all his possessions, turn over the house\n",
      "335\n",
      "to his mother to keep, and whoever it was she married.”\n",
      "So they spoke. Tēlemachos now went down to his father’s storeroom,\n",
      "broad and high-ceilinged, where gold and bronze lay piled,\n",
      "with clothes in chests, an abundance of sweet-smelling oil,\n",
      "and jars of wine, well aged and sweet on the palate,\n",
      "340\n",
      "holding within them an unmixed heavenly drink,\n",
      "set close together along the wall, for the day when Odysseus,\n",
      "after laboring through much hardship, might come back home.\n",
      "The close-carpentered double doors remained shut and locked,\n",
      "and both day and night a housekeeper kept watch there,\n",
      "345\n",
      "guarding everything, both prudent and vigilant:\n",
      "Eurykleia, daughter of Ōps, Peisenōr’s son. Her now\n",
      "Tēlemachos called to the storeroom, and addressed her, saying:\n",
      "“Good old nurse, please draw me off wine in two-handled jars—\n",
      "sweet wine, the best there is after what you’re keeping back\n",
      "350\n",
      "for him, the ill-fated one, just in case from heaven knows where\n",
      "Zeus’ scion Odysseus returns, escaping death and the fates!\n",
      "Fill me twelve jars, and fit them all with stoppers,\n",
      "and measure out barley into well-stitched leather bags—\n",
      "there should be twenty measures of well-ground barley meal.\n",
      "355\n",
      "Have all this taken care of. No one else is to know about it.\n",
      "I’ll pick up the load this evening, when my mother\n",
      "goes to her upper chamber and retires for the night.\n",
      "For I’m making a journey to Sparta and to sandy Pylos\n",
      "to seek any news I may learn about my dear father’s return.”\n",
      "360\n",
      "So he spoke, and his dear nurse Eurykleia shrieked aloud,\n",
      "and, lamenting, then addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Ah, how, dear child, did this thought ever enter your mind?\n",
      "Where in this whole wide earth do you plan to go to, you,\n",
      "an only child and much loved? But Odysseus, scion of Zeus,\n",
      "365\n",
      "has already died, far from home, in some foreign country,\n",
      "and the moment you’re gone these men will make trouble for you,\n",
      "destroy you by guile, and share out all your goods!\n",
      "Stay here and look after what’s yours: you have no need\n",
      "to wander and suffer misfortunes on the unharvested sea.”\n",
      "370\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Never fear, old nurse: this plan does not lack divine support!\n",
      "Now, promise you won’t say a word of it to my mother\n",
      "before eleven or twelve days have passed, or else until\n",
      "she herself misses me and hears that I’ve set out—\n",
      "375\n",
      "I don’t want her to spoil her fine complexion with weeping.”\n",
      "So he spoke: the old woman swore a great oath, by the gods,\n",
      "that she wouldn’t tell. When she’d sworn, and completed the oath,\n",
      "she at once drew off the wine in two-handled jars,\n",
      "and measured the barley meal into well-stitched leather bags,\n",
      "380\n",
      "while Tēlemachos went back to the hall and joined the suitors.\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, had another thought:\n",
      "in Tēlemachos’ likeness she went all around the city,\n",
      "approaching each man in turn with an identical message,\n",
      "that they should assemble that evening alongside the swift ship.\n",
      "385\n",
      "That done, she then asked Noēmōn, illustrious son\n",
      "of Phronios, for a swift ship. He readily promised it her.\n",
      "So the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow,\n",
      "and she drew the swift ship down to the sea, and left it\n",
      "with all the gear that well-benched vessels carry,\n",
      "390\n",
      "moored at the harbor entrance. Beside it a doughty\n",
      "company gathered: the goddess put strength in each man there.\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, had another thought:\n",
      "she made her way to the home of godlike Odysseus,\n",
      "and there shed sweet drowsiness over all the suitors\n",
      "395\n",
      "as they drank, befuddled their wits, made them drop their cups.\n",
      "Up they got, to go home to bed: no longer did they\n",
      "sit on there, now sleep weighed heavy on their eyelids.\n",
      "That done, to Tēlemachos grey-eyed Athēnē now spoke,\n",
      "called him out from his well-established domain,\n",
      "400\n",
      "assuming the likeness of Mentōr, in both form and voice:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, already your well-greaved comrades are seated\n",
      "at their oars, ready and waiting for the start of your voyage!\n",
      "Come then, let’s go, no point in delaying your departure.”\n",
      "That said, Pallas Athēnē now briskly led the way,\n",
      "405\n",
      "and Tēlemachos followed behind, in the goddess’ footsteps.\n",
      "When they came down to the sea and the vessel, they found\n",
      "their long-haired comrades there, awaiting them on the shore,\n",
      "and Tēlemachos, princely in power, now addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Come, friends, let us fetch the provisions: they’re all ready,\n",
      "410\n",
      "back in the hall. My mother knows nothing of this,\n",
      "nor do her maidservants, except for the one I told.”\n",
      "So saying, he led the way, and they accompanied him.\n",
      "They carried back all the provisions, stowed them away\n",
      "in the well-benched ship, as Odysseus’ fine son commanded.\n",
      "415\n",
      "Then Tēlemachos went aboard, preceded by Athēnē,\n",
      "who sat herself down in the stern, and Tēlemachos came\n",
      "and sat down beside her. Men cast off the stern warps\n",
      "and scrambled aboard, and took their seats on the benches.\n",
      "Now grey-eyed Athēnē sent them a following wind,\n",
      "420\n",
      "a fresh west wind, loud-sounding over the wine-dark deep.\n",
      "Tēlemachos urged on his crew, gave them the order\n",
      "to haul on the sheets, and they obeyed his command.\n",
      "They raised the fir-wood mast, set it upright in its hollow\n",
      "mast-block, firmly belayed the sheets to the forestays,\n",
      "425\n",
      "then hauled up the white sail with cords of plaited oxhide.\n",
      "The wind bellied the mid-sail, and cleft by the cutwater\n",
      "a dark surging wave sang aloud as the ship drove forward,\n",
      "shearing her path through the deep, accomplishing her journey.\n",
      "When they’d belayed the tackle in the swift black ship\n",
      "430\n",
      "they set out mixing bowls brimming with wine, and poured\n",
      "libations to the immortal gods that are forever,\n",
      "and foremost of all to the grey-eyed daughter of Zeus.\n",
      "So all night and into the dawn the vessel cut her course.\n",
      "Book 3\n",
      "Deserting the deep’s enchanting surface, the sun rose up\n",
      "into the brazen sky to bring light both to immortals\n",
      "and to mortal beings upon the grain-rich plowland,\n",
      "and they came to Pylos, the well-built citadel of Nēleus.\n",
      "Here, on the shore of the sea, sacrifices were being made\n",
      "5\n",
      "of all-black bulls to the dark-haired Earth-Shaker. Nine\n",
      "companies there were, and five hundred men were seated\n",
      "in each, and each brought nine bulls. It was when they’d sampled\n",
      "the innards and were burning thigh pieces for the gods\n",
      "that the travelers arrived. They at once hauled up and brailed\n",
      "10\n",
      "the trim ship’s sail, moored her, and came ashore themselves.\n",
      "With Athēnē leading the way, Tēlemachos disembarked,\n",
      "and the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, now first addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, you’ve no longer the least need for modesty—\n",
      "the whole point of your voyage is to get news of your father:\n",
      "15\n",
      "where he may have been buried, what kind of fate he met.\n",
      "But for now, go straight up to Nestōr, tamer of horses,\n",
      "and let’s find out what advice lies hidden in his breast!\n",
      "Entreat him yourself, have him tell you the true story—\n",
      "a lie he won’t utter: he’s a most sagacious person.”\n",
      "20\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos answered her in these words:\n",
      "“What, Mentōr, must be my approach? How am I to greet him?\n",
      "I’ve no experience yet in subtle discourse; a young\n",
      "man feels embarrassed when interrogating his elders.”\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "25\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, there are some things you’ll figure out for yourself,\n",
      "and for others you’ll have divine guidance—I don’t think\n",
      "you were born and raised without the gods’ good favor.”\n",
      "So Pallas Athēnē spoke, and proceeded to lead the way\n",
      "briskly, Tēlemachos following in the goddess’ footsteps,\n",
      "30\n",
      "and they came to the Pylian men’s assembly and companies.\n",
      "There Nestōr sat with his sons, and around them their comrades\n",
      "were preparing the feast, roasting some meat, had the rest on spits.\n",
      "But when they spotted the strangers, they all came flocking\n",
      "to meet them, shook their hands, made them sit down.\n",
      "35\n",
      "Peisistratos, Nestōr’s son, was the first to reach them,\n",
      "took them both by the hand, seated them at the feast\n",
      "on soft sheepskins, there on the sandy seashore,\n",
      "next to his father and Thrasymēdēs his brother,\n",
      "gave them helpings of innards, poured out wine\n",
      "40\n",
      "in a golden cup, and addressed with welcoming words\n",
      "Pallas Athēnē, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis:\n",
      "“Make your prayer now, stranger, to the lord Poseidōn,\n",
      "for his is the feast you have chanced upon, coming here.\n",
      "And when you have fittingly prayed and poured libations,\n",
      "45\n",
      "then give this man also the cup of honey-sweet wine\n",
      "to pour a libation, since he, too, I take it, prays\n",
      "to the immortals: all humans stand in need of the gods.\n",
      "Still, he is younger, and about the same age as I am:\n",
      "that’s why to you first I now give this golden cup.”\n",
      "50\n",
      "So saying, he placed in her hand the cup of sweet wine,\n",
      "and Athēnē rejoiced at this man’s nice sense of decorum,\n",
      "in giving the golden cup to her first of all; and at once\n",
      "she offered this heartfelt prayer to the lord Poseidōn:\n",
      "“Hear me, Poseidōn, Earth-Mover! Do not begrudge us\n",
      "55\n",
      "fulfillment of all that our prayers are now requesting!\n",
      "On Nestōr, first and foremost, and his sons, bestow renown,\n",
      "and next, to the rest, to all Pylians, grant a pleasing\n",
      "requital for this most splendid and generous sacrifice!\n",
      "Grant, too, that we may go home again, Tēlemachos and I,\n",
      "60\n",
      "having achieved what we came here for in our swift black ship.”\n",
      "So she prayed—and herself was bringing it all to pass.\n",
      "Now she gave to Tēlemachos the fine two-handled cup,\n",
      "and in like manner Odysseus’ dear son then prayed.\n",
      "When the outer meat was roasted, and off the spits, they next\n",
      "65\n",
      "divided the helpings, and shared in the sumptuous feast.\n",
      "But when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "the first to speak was Nestōr, the Gerēnian horseman:\n",
      "“Now is a better time to interrogate these strangers,\n",
      "enquire who they are, now they’ve had their fill of food.\n",
      "70\n",
      "So, strangers, who are you? From where was it you sailed here\n",
      "over the watery ways? On business? Or are you reckless rovers,\n",
      "cruising the sea like pirates, who, at risk of their own lives,\n",
      "go around making trouble for men from other lands?”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, greatly\n",
      "75\n",
      "encouraged: Athēnē herself now put fresh confidence\n",
      "into his heart, to enquire about his long-absent father,\n",
      "[and win a good reputation among men at large]:1\n",
      "“Nestōr, son of Nēleus, great glory of the Achaians,\n",
      "you want to know where we come from? Then I shall tell you.\n",
      "80\n",
      "We’re here from that part of Ithákē under Mount Neïon,\n",
      "and the business I’ll speak of isn’t public, but personal.\n",
      "I’ve come to pursue any rumors about my father—\n",
      "the noble, steadfast Odysseus, who once, they say,\n",
      "fighting alongside you, brought down the Trojans’ city.\n",
      "85\n",
      "Of all the others who fought against the Trojans, we’ve since\n",
      "learned how and where it was that each met his grim end;\n",
      "but with him Kronos’ son has ensured that even his death’s\n",
      "unknown—no one can say for certain the place where he perished,\n",
      "whether dispatched by enemies on the mainland\n",
      "90\n",
      "or out on the deep, amid Amphitrītē’s breakers.2\n",
      "That’s why I’m here at your knees now—you might be willing\n",
      "to tell me about his grim death, if you maybe saw it\n",
      "yourself, or heard an account of it from some other\n",
      "wanderer: to unmatched sorrow his mother bore him!\n",
      "95\n",
      "And don’t, from concern or pity, speak false comfort to me,\n",
      "but tell me exactly whatever you may have witnessed!\n",
      "I beseech you, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, made you\n",
      "any promise, by word or action, and delivered on it\n",
      "in the land of the Trojans, where you Achaians met grief,\n",
      "100\n",
      "remember it now, and tell me the unerring truth of it.”\n",
      "Nestōr, Gerēnian horseman, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Friend, since you’ve recalled all the grief that we endured\n",
      "in that land—we, the dauntless sons of the Achaians!—\n",
      "whether on board our ships, on the hazy deep, in pursuit\n",
      "105\n",
      "of booty, wherever Achillēs might choose to lead us,\n",
      "or our drawn-out struggle around King Priam’s great city—\n",
      "ah, it was there that all our very best were slain!\n",
      "There lies the warrior Aias, there lies Achillēs, there\n",
      "Patroklos, a man who could match the gods in counsel;\n",
      "110\n",
      "and there my own dear son, so strong and so virtuous—\n",
      "Antilochos, in the first rank as both runner and fighter.\n",
      "Many more ills we endured in addition to these: their sum\n",
      "what transient mortal could ever narrate in full?\n",
      "Not even were you to stay for five—no, six!—whole years\n",
      "115\n",
      "would you hear of all the woes the noble Achaians bore there—\n",
      "and before then, surfeited, you’d have gone back home for sure!\n",
      "Nine years we were busy cobbling up trouble for them\n",
      "with ruses of every sort: Kronos’ son took a weary age\n",
      "to finish the job! There no one tried to compete with noble\n",
      "120\n",
      "Odysseus in scheming, since he far outstripped them all\n",
      "with ruses of every sort—he, your father, if it’s really true\n",
      "that you are his offspring! When I look at you I wonder,\n",
      "for your way of speaking is like his, one would never think\n",
      "that so young a man could speak in so proper a manner!\n",
      "125\n",
      "The whole time noble Odysseus and I were out there, neither\n",
      "in council nor in assembly did we oppose each other,\n",
      "but, being of one mind, with good plans and shrewd judgment\n",
      "we’d counsel the Argives on their best course of action.\n",
      "But after we’d sacked the towering citadel of Priam\n",
      "130\n",
      "and had sailed away, and a god had scattered the Achaians,\n",
      "then indeed it was that Zeus planned a grim homecoming\n",
      "for the Argives, since not all of them were either right-thinking\n",
      "or civilized: thus many met a bad end through the deadly\n",
      "wrath of the grey-eyed daughter of a mighty sire. It was she\n",
      "135\n",
      "who stirred up strife between the two sons of Atreus.\n",
      "The two of them called an assembly of all the Achaians,\n",
      "thoughtlessly, not in due order, very close to sunset,\n",
      "and the Achaians’ sons arrived well loaded with wine\n",
      "to hear their speeches, and learn why they’d been summoned.\n",
      "140\n",
      "Now Menelaös was urging the whole body of the Achaians\n",
      "to embark on the voyage home, over the sea’s broad back;\n",
      "but this didn’t please Agamemnōn at all: what he wanted\n",
      "was to keep the army in place, and make lavish sacrifices\n",
      "to appease the dread wrath of Athēnē—fool that he was,\n",
      "145\n",
      "not knowing that she wouldn’t pay him the least attention,\n",
      "since the mind of the gods eternal is not changed in a moment.\n",
      "So the pair of them stood there, exchanging angry words,\n",
      "while the well-greaved Achaians sprang to their feet with a deafening\n",
      "clamor, and both these schemes collected their supporters.\n",
      "150\n",
      "We spent that night nursing harsh thoughts against\n",
      "one another, while Zeus was devising a grief of evils. At dawn\n",
      "some of us hauled our vessel down to the bright salt sea,\n",
      "and put aboard our possessions and our deep-sashed women;\n",
      "but half of the force held back, remained in place there\n",
      "155\n",
      "with Atreus’ son Agamemnōn, his people’s shepherd.\n",
      "So half of us now embarked, and rowed out: swiftly our ships\n",
      "moved on, for a god smoothed the monster-infested deep.\n",
      "When we reached Tenedos we sacrificed to the gods,\n",
      "longing for home; but Zeus, not thinking yet of return—\n",
      "160\n",
      "the wretch!—rather stirred up bad strife for the second time!\n",
      "Some now brought their curved vessels around, sailed back\n",
      "with lordly Odysseus—so clever, so subtle-minded—\n",
      "once again showing favor to Atreus’ son Agamemnōn;\n",
      "but I, with the full squadron of ships that followed me,\n",
      "165\n",
      "kept retreating—I realized the god was planning trouble!—\n",
      "as did Tydeus’ son too, Arēs’ favorite, urging on his men,\n",
      "while, late in the day, there followed us fair-haired Meneläos,\n",
      "who caught up with us at Lesbos, debating the long voyage—\n",
      "should we set our course seaward, north of rocky Chios,\n",
      "170\n",
      "by the island of Psyra, with Chios on our port side,\n",
      "or sail landward of Chios, past Mimas’ windswept headland?\n",
      "So we asked the god to show us a sign, and he did,\n",
      "bidding us cut our way through the deep-sea route to Euboia,\n",
      "and thus the soonest get ourselves clear of misfortune.\n",
      "175\n",
      "A good tailwind got up now and blew: our vessels ran\n",
      "swiftly across the sea’s fish-rich paths and reached\n",
      "Geraistos at night: to Poseidōn we sacrificed many\n",
      "bulls’ thighs, grateful that we’d traversed the open water.\n",
      "It was on the fourth day that the comrades of Diomēdēs\n",
      "180\n",
      "the horse breaker anchored their trim ships at Argos;\n",
      "but I held on course for Pylos, nor did that good tailwind\n",
      "drop once, from the time the god first set it on to blow.\n",
      "Thus I came back, dear child, without news, nor do I know\n",
      "anything of the rest, which Achaians survived, which perished.\n",
      "185\n",
      "But such reports as have reached me while ensconced here at home\n",
      "I shall pass on, as is proper, and not conceal them from you.\n",
      "The Myrmidons, those fierce spearmen, they say made it back,\n",
      "led by great-hearted Achillēs’ illustrious son; back too\n",
      "came Philoktētēs, the distinguished offspring of Poias,\n",
      "190\n",
      "while Idomeneus brought safely home to Krētē all those\n",
      "comrades surviving the conflict: the sea took none of them.\n",
      "About Atreus’ son you yourselves, though distant, will have heard:\n",
      "how he returned, how Aigisthos devised a grim end for him.\n",
      "Yet Aigisthos indeed was to pay a most terrible reckoning:\n",
      "195\n",
      "so it’s good that when any man dies a son should survive,\n",
      "since here was a son took revenge on his father’s killer—\n",
      "the crafty Aigisthos, who’d murdered his famous father.\n",
      "You too, my friend—for I see how handsome and tall you are—\n",
      "be valiant, that men yet unborn may speak well of you!”\n",
      "200\n",
      "Then sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Nestōr, Nēleus’ son, great glory of the Achaians,\n",
      "that man indeed got full vengeance, and the Achaians\n",
      "shall spread his fame far and wide, for men unborn to hear!\n",
      "If only the gods would endow me with the strength\n",
      "205\n",
      "to punish these suitors for their grievous transgression—\n",
      "their wanton insults, their malicious acts against me!\n",
      "But no such good fortune have the gods ever assigned\n",
      "to me or my father: now I just have to endure.”\n",
      "Nestōr, Gerēnian horseman, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "210\n",
      "“Friend, since by mentioning it you’ve reminded me of this,\n",
      "numerous suitors, they say, for your mother’s hand, are there\n",
      "in your halls against your will, and making trouble for you.\n",
      "So tell me, are you letting yourself be bullied, or do\n",
      "the folk of the district, swayed by some god’s word, despise you?\n",
      "215\n",
      "Who knows, one day he may come back, may be revenged,\n",
      "either alone, or with all the Achaians. If only grey-eyed\n",
      "Athēnē might choose now to love you as much as once,\n",
      "long ago, she was concerned for renowned Odysseus\n",
      "in the land of the Trojans, where we Achaians suffered\n",
      "220\n",
      "much hardship: for never I saw such open love from the gods\n",
      "as Pallas Athēnē showed him, standing openly at his side!\n",
      "If she would love you as much, and care for you in her heart,\n",
      "then some of these men would quite forget about marriage.”\n",
      "Then sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying\n",
      "225\n",
      "“Old sir, I don’t think your words will ever find fulfillment:\n",
      "What you say is too much, I’m dumbfounded, what I hope for\n",
      "could never happen, not even were the gods to will it so!”\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, what’s this word has escaped your teeth’s barrier?\n",
      "230\n",
      "A determined god could save a man easily, even from afar!\n",
      "I’d rather endure endless setbacks on the journey back\n",
      "before I got home, and saw the day of my returning,\n",
      "rather than make it there only to perish, as Agamemnōn\n",
      "was killed by Aigisthos’ treachery, and that of his own wife.\n",
      "235\n",
      "Yet death, that’s common to all, not the gods themselves\n",
      "can ward off even from a man they love, whenever\n",
      "the dire fate of pitiless death has once got hold of him.”\n",
      "Then sagacious Tēlemachos responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Mentōr, despite our grief, let’s talk no more of these matters:\n",
      "240\n",
      "For him a return’s not reality now: long, long before this\n",
      "for him the immortals will have contrived death and black fate.\n",
      "But now I want to ask Nestōr about a different matter,\n",
      "since his knowledge of justice and wisdom is unsurpassed—\n",
      "three times, they say, he’s ruled a generation of men,\n",
      "245\n",
      "and to me he has the appearance of an immortal!\n",
      "So, Nestōr, son of Nēleus, tell me this in all honesty:\n",
      "how did Atreus’ son die, wide-ruling Agamemnōn?\n",
      "And where was Menelaös? What death for the king did sly\n",
      "Aigisthos contrive, since it was a far better man he killed?\n",
      "250\n",
      "Was he, Menelaös, not there in Achaian Argos, but roaming\n",
      "abroad, so that Aigisthos could nerve himself for murder?”\n",

      "on his return from Troy, Aigisthos alive in his halls!\n",
      "Not even on his corpse then would the earth have been piled,\n",
      "but the dogs and the birds of prey would have devoured him\n",
      "as he lay on the plain, far outside the city, nor would any\n",
      "260\n",
      "Achaian women have mourned him, so vile the deed he wrought.\n",
      "While we were bivouacked out there, campaigning long and hard,\n",
      "he, at his ease in a corner of horse-grazing Argos,\n",

      "Now she indeed to begin with rejected the shameful act,\n",
      "265\n",
      "did the noble Klytaimnēstra, since hers was a virtuous heart;\n",
      "and with her she had a minstrel, whom Atreus’ son had ordered,\n",
      "before leaving for Troy, to be her strict bodyguard.\n",
      "But when divine destiny ensnared her for destruction,\n",
      "then it was that Aigisthos marooned the minstrel, left him\n",
      "270\n",
      "on a desert island, a tasty morsel for birds of prey.\n",
      "Her then he took back—both willing—to his own home.\n",
      "Many thigh pieces he burned on the gods’ hallowed altars,\n",
      "and hung up numerous offerings, both woven and golden,\n",
      "after bringing off the vile action he never hoped to achieve.3\n",
      "275\n",
      "“We were sailing together on our way back from Troy,\n",
      "Atreus’ son and myself, close friends with one another;\n",
      "but when we reached sacred Sounion, the headland of Athens,\n",
      "there it was that Phoibos Apollo slew Menelaös’ steersman,\n",
      "assailing him with his painless shafts while in his hands\n",
      "280\n",
      "he still held the steering oar of the speeding vessel—\n",
      "Phrontis, the son of Onētōr, who excelled all tribes of mankind\n",
      "at steering a ship when gale-force winds were blowing.\n",
      "So Menelaös put in there, though impatient to be sailing,\n",
      "to bury his comrade, perform the proper rites over him.\n",
      "285\n",
      "But when he too in his voyage over the wine-dark deep\n",
      "in his hollow ships arrived off the sheer heights of Malea,\n",
      "running swiftly, then far-seeing Zeus devised a way to make\n",
      "his voyage disastrous: poured blasts of shrill winds on him,\n",
      "swelled the waves to vast size, till they resembled mountains.\n",
      "290\n",
      "Then he split the flotilla in two, directed some ships to Krētē,\n",
      "to where the Kydōnians dwelt around Iardanos’ streams.\n",
      "There’s a certain steep headland, juts sheer out into the sea,\n",
      "at the frontier of Gortyn, in the mist-shrouded deep,\n",
      "where southwest gales drive great waves against the headland’s\n",
      "295\n",
      "left side, toward Phaistos, and low rocks hold back the waves’\n",
      "violence. Here some ships came, their crewmen barely\n",
      "escaping disaster: the ships themselves were smashed\n",
      "to pieces upon the reef. But the five other dark-prowed vessels\n",
      "were carried away by wind and wave to Egypt.\n",
      "300\n",
      "So Menelaös spent time there amassing goods and gold,\n",
      "going to and fro in his ships among men of alien speech.\n",
      "Meanwhile Aigisthos back home enacted his grim plot:\n",
      "he killed Atreus’ son, had the people as his subjects.\n",
      "Seven years he reigned as king over golden Mykēnai\n",
      "305\n",
      "but in the eighth evil came for him—the noble Orestēs,\n",
      "back home from Athens, who slew his father’s slayer,\n",
      "the crafty Aigisthos, who’d murdered his famous father.\n",
      "After he’d killed him, he held a funeral feast for the Argives\n",
      "over his hateful mother and the cowardly Aigisthos,\n",
      "310\n",
      "and that same day there arrived Menelaös of the great war cry,\n",
      "with treasure galore, as much freight as his ships could carry.\n",
      "“So you too, friend, should not wander over-far from home,\n",
      "leaving your wealth behind you, as well as men in your house\n",
      "of such arrogance, lest they share and devour your goods,\n",
      "315\n",
      "making your journey here a mere fool’s errand! But now\n",
      "the man I insist on your visiting is Menelaös, for he\n",
      "has lately returned from abroad, got himself back home\n",
      "from a people that no one would ever hope in his heart\n",
      "to return from, once great storms had driven him off course\n",
      "320\n",
      "into a sea so vast that migrant birds take an entire\n",
      "year to travel back from it, so vast and fearsome it is!\n",
      "So be off with you now, you, your ship, and your comrades—\n",
      "or go overland if you’d rather: here are chariot and horses,\n",
      "and here, too, are my sons, who’ll accompany you as guides\n",
      "325\n",
      "to lordly Lakedaimōn, home to fair-haired Menelaös.\n",
      "Appeal to him in person, to tell you the whole truth:\n",
      "He won’t tell you lies, he’s far too sagacious.” So\n",
      "he spoke, and the sun went down, and darkness came on.\n",
      "Among them there then spoke the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē:\n",
      "330\n",
      "“Old sir, all this that you’ve told us was properly conveyed.\n",
      "But come now, cut up the ox tongues, and mix the wine,\n",
      "so that after libations to Poseidōn and the other immortals\n",
      "we may turn our minds to sleep: that time has arrived.\n",
      "Light’s passed under darkness already, and it’s not fitting\n",
      "335\n",
      "to sit late at a feast of the gods: best to be on one’s way.”\n",
      "So spoke the daughter of Zeus, and they paid attention to her.\n",
      "Heralds now poured out water over their hands,\n",
      "while young men topped up the mixing bowls with wine\n",
      "and served it to them all, with drops first in each cup.4\n",
      "340\n",
      "The tongues they threw in the fire, then stood, and poured\n",
      "libations on them. This done, when they’d drunk as much\n",
      "as they felt like, then both Athēnē and godlike Tēlemachos\n",
      "were eager to be on their way to the hollow ship;\n",
      "but Nestōr spoke persuasively, anxious to keep them there:\n",
      "345\n",
      "“Zeus forbid, and all the other immortal gods,\n",
      "that you should go back from my house to your hollow ship\n",
      "as though from some indigent wretch with no spare bedclothes,\n",
      "no coverlets in his home, no abundance of blankets\n",
      "on which both he and his guests could sleep in comfort!\n",
      "350\n",
      "Here in my house are coverlets and the finest blankets,\n",
      "and never shall the dear son of that fine man Odysseus\n",
      "bed down on a ship’s afterdeck as long as I’m alive,\n",
      "and sons survive after me, are left here in my halls\n",
      "to look after whatever guest-friend may come visiting.”\n",
      "355\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“This was well said, old friend! And it’s right that Tēlemachos\n",
      "should listen to you, since that is by far the better way.\n",
      "So he’ll stay with you tonight, sleep on a bed in your house;\n",
      "but I shall take myself off to our black ship,\n",
      "360\n",
      "cheer our companions, tell them all the news.\n",
      "For I think I’m the only older person among them:\n",
      "the rest are younger men, who came with him as friends,\n",
      "all about the same age as great-hearted Tēlemachos.\n",
      "It’s there I shall lie tonight, by the hollow black ship;\n",
      "365\n",
      "then tomorrow morning I’ll be off to the great-hearted\n",
      "Kaukōnians, where there’s a debt owed to me, neither recent\n",
      "nor small. But you send this young man, your visiting guest,\n",
      "on his way in a chariot, along with your son, and give him\n",
      "horses as well, your lightest runners, your best for strength.”\n",
      "370\n",
      "So saying, the grey-eyed goddess Athēnē went on her way\n",
      "in the likeness of a sea eagle: all who saw it were astounded,\n",
      "including old Nestōr, who marveled at what his eyes beheld,\n",
      "and he clasped Tēlemachos’ hand, and said to him: “Friend,\n",
      "I hardly think you’ll turn out a mean fellow or a coward\n",
      "375\n",
      "if indeed when you’re so young the gods act as your escorts!\n",
      "For this was none other of those whose homes are on Olympos\n",
      "than Zeus’ own true-born daughter, maiden most glorious, who\n",
      "likewise honored your noble father among the Argives!\n",
      "Be gracious to me, my queen, grant me high renown\n",
      "380\n",
      "for myself, for my sons, and for my revered bedfellow,\n",
      "and to you in return I’ll sacrifice a yearling heifer, broad-browed,\n",
      "still unbroken, that no man has yet led under the yoke:\n",
      "that’s the one I shall sacrifice, and gild her horns with gold.”\n",
      "So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athēnē heard him.\n",
      "385\n",
      "Now Nestōr, Gerēnian horseman, led them, with his sons\n",
      "and his daughters’ husbands, to his splendid domain,\n",
      "and when they reached the renowned domain of the king,\n",
      "they sat down there in order on the chairs and benches.\n",
      "When all of them were settled, the old man mixed them a bowl\n",
      "390\n",
      "of delicious wine, which was in its eleventh year\n",
      "when the housekeeper broke its seal and opened the jar.\n",
      "This wine the old man mixed, with many prayers, as he poured\n",
      "libations to Athēnē, daughter of Zeus of the aegis.\n",
      "When they’d poured libations, and drunk all they’d a mind to,\n",
      "395\n",
      "they went to lie down and sleep, each one in his own dwelling.\n",
      "But Nestōr, Gerēnian horseman, kept Tēlemachos, the dear son\n",
      "of godlike Odysseus, to sleep there, settling him down\n",
      "on a corded bedstead out in the echoing portico,\n",
      "and with him Peisistratos, of the good ash spear, a leader\n",
      "400\n",
      "of men, a still unmarried son of his in the halls,\n",
      "while he himself took his repose in the high house’s inmost room,\n",
      "and beside him his lady wife now shared their bed and marriage.\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "Nestōr, Gerēnian horseman, rose from his bed, went out,\n",
      "405\n",
      "and sat himself down on one of the polished stone blocks\n",
      "that stood outside his high entrance doors, bright white\n",
      "with a gleam as of oil. This was the place where in time past\n",
      "Nēleus would sit, a counselor as prestigious as any god;\n",
      "but he’d long since succumbed to fate, gone down to Hadēs,\n",
      "410\n",
      "and now Gerēnian Nestōr, the Achaians’ guardian, sat there,\n",
      "scepter in hand, and around him a crowd of his sons gathered,\n",
      "coming out from their bedrooms: Echéphrōn, Stratios,\n",
      "Perseus, Arētos, and—a match for a god—Thrasymēdēs;\n",
      "then, sixth after these, the hero Peisistratos followed,\n",
      "415\n",
      "beside whom they brought in and seated godlike Tēlemachos.\n",
      "Nestōr, Gerēnian horseman, was the first to speak among them:\n",
      "“Quickly now, my dear children, help realize my desire—\n",
      "that very first of all deities I may propitiate Athēnē,\n",
      "who came, clearly manifest, to our rich feast for the god!\n",
      "420\n",
      "So let one man go to the plain for a heifer, making sure\n",
      "that it comes here right away, with its cowherd driving it;\n",
      "and another to the black ship of great-hearted Tēlemachos,\n",
      "to fetch all his comrades, leaving there two men only;\n",
      "and another again to send here the goldsmith Laerkēs,\n",
      "425\n",
      "to overlay the horns of the heifer with gold. You others\n",
      "are all to stay here, and issue instructions to my servants\n",
      "that they should make ready a feast in my far-famed halls,\n",
      "and bring in more chairs and firewood and clear bright water.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and they all bustled busily. The heifer arrived\n",
      "430\n",
      "from the plain, and, from their swift trim vessel, great-hearted\n",
      "Tēlemachos’ comrades showed up. The smith came too\n",
      "bringing his bronze tools, the essentials of his trade:\n",
      "anvil and hammer and finely fashioned tongs\n",
      "with which he worked the gold. Athēnē likewise came\n",
      "435\n",
      "to be there at the sacrifice. Then Nestōr, old chariot driver,\n",
      "gave the smith gold: he prepared it, overlaid the heifer’s horns,\n",
      "that the goddess might rejoice at the sight of her offering.\n",
      "By its horns Stratios and noble Echéphrōn led in the heifer,\n",
      "and Arētos, bringing out water in a flower-decked basin,\n",
      "440\n",
      "came from the inner chamber, in his other hand a basket\n",
      "of barley-grain; Thrasymēdēs, that doughty fighter, stood by,\n",
      "a sharp axe in his hand with which to fell the heifer,\n",
      "while Perseus readied the blood bowl. Nestōr, old chariot driver,\n",
      "began with the lustral water and sprinkling of barley, offered\n",
      "445\n",
      "long prayers to Athēnē, threw the victim’s cut hairs in the fire.\n",
      "When they’d prayed, and scattered the barley grains, then at once\n",
      "Nestōr’s son, high-spirited Thrasymēdēs, stepped\n",
      "forward and struck. His axe sheared through the neck’s tendons,\n",
      "undid the strength of the heifer. The women keened:\n",
      "450\n",
      "the daughters, the sons’ wives, Nestōr’s revered\n",
      "bedfellow Eurydikē, the eldest of Klymenos’ daughters.\n",
      "The men now raised the victim from the wide-wayed earth\n",
      "and held it; Peisistratos, leader of men, cut its throat.\n",
      "When the black blood had flowed from it, and life had left its bones,\n",
      "455\n",
      "at once they dismembered it, chopped out the thigh pieces\n",
      "all in due order, then covered them with a layer of fat\n",
      "folded double, laid raw bits of meat upon them. Then\n",
      "the old man roasted them over split billets, drizzled with bright\n",
      "wine, and young men beside him held their five-pronged forks.\n",
      "460\n",
      "When the thighs were properly barbecued, and they’d had a taste\n",
      "of the innards, they cut up the rest and roasted it on spits\n",
      "until it was done through, held the pointed spits in their hands.\n",
      "Tēlemachos meanwhile was bathed by beautiful Polykastē,\n",
      "the youngest daughter of Nestōr, Nēleus’ son; and after\n",
      "465\n",
      "she’d bathed him, and massaged him generously with oil,\n",
      "and dressed him in a fine mantle and tunic, he came forth\n",
      "from the bathtub in appearance like the immortals, and went\n",
      "and seated himself by Nestōr, the shepherd of his people.\n",
      "When the outer flesh was well roasted they drew it off the spits,\n",
      "470\n",
      "and sat down and feasted; good fellows waited on them,\n",
      "pouring the wine out for them into golden goblets.\n",
      "But when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "Nestōr, Gerēnian horseman, was the first to speak among them:\n",
      "“Come, my sons, harness up our fine-maned horses to\n",
      "475\n",
      "the chariot for Tēlemachos, so he can start his journey.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and they hearkened promptly, and obeyed him:\n",
      "at once to the chariot they harnessed the swift horses,\n",
      "and the housekeeper put in the chariot bread and wine\n",
      "and cooked meat, such as princes, Zeus’ nurslings, feed upon.\n",
      "480\n",
      "Then Tēlemachos climbed aboard the elegant chariot,\n",
      "And Nestōr’s son Peisistratos, leader of men,\n",
      "mounted beside him, took the reins in his hands, and used\n",
      "the whip to start the pair: they, nothing loath, sped off\n",
      "onto the plain, abandoning Pylos’ steep citadel,\n",
      "485\n",
      "and all day shook the yoke that spanned their shoulders.\n",
      "Then the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow,\n",
      "and they came to Phērai, to the dwelling of Dioklēs\n",
      "the son of Ortilochos, whom Alpheios sired as his offspring,\n",
      "and spent the night there; he treated them as guest-friends.\n",
      "490\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "they yoked the horses, boarded the inlaid chariot,\n",
      "drove out from the courtyard and echoing portico, used\n",
      "the whip to start the pair: they, nothing loath, sped off,\n",
      "and came to the wheat-bearing plain. From there they pursued\n",
      "495\n",
      "their journey at speed, so well did their swift horses bear them.\n",
      "Then the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow.\n",
      "Book 4\n",
      "Now they came to deep-hollowed Lakedaimōn with its ravines\n",
      "and drove till they reached the domain of far-famed Menelaös.\n",
      "Him they found holding a wedding feast with his many kinsmen\n",
      "for a son and an elegant daughter, there in his own dwelling:\n",
      "her he was sending out to Achillēs’ son, the rank-breaker,1\n",
      "5\n",
      "for in Troy’s country he first had pledged his word that he’d\n",
      "give her to him, and now the gods were fulfilling the match.\n",
      "With horses and chariots she was soon to travel\n",
      "to the Myrmidons’ famed city,2 where her spouse was king;\n",
      "while he was bringing from Sparta Alektōr’s daughter,\n",
      "10\n",
      "to wed his favorite son, the doughty Megapenthēs,\n",
      "born of a slave girl: to Helen the gods granted no more\n",
      "issue after her first child, the lovely Hermionē,\n",
      "who had all the beauty of golden Aphrodītē. So they\n",
      "were feasting there in the spacious high-roofed hall—\n",
      "15\n",
      "the neighbors and kinsmen of far-famed Menelaös,\n",
      "at ease, while among them a godlike minstrel was singing\n",
      "and playing the lyre, while two tumblers circled\n",
      "about in the thick of them, leading off the dance.\n",
      "The two out at the gateway, themselves and their horses—\n",
      "20\n",
      "the hero Tēlemachos and Nestōr’s splendid son—\n",
      "pulled up short, were seen by the lord Eteōneus as he\n",
      "came out: he, the deft squire of far-famed Menelaös.\n",
      "Back through the hall he went to tell the people’s shepherd,\n",
      "approached him, and standing close uttered these winged words:\n",
      "25\n",
      "“Menelaös, Zeus’ nursling, there are two strangers here—\n",
      "two men who look very much like the offspring of great Zeus!\n",
      "Tell me, shall we unharness their speedy horses,\n",
      "or send them on somewhere else for their entertainment?”\n",
      "Much annoyed, fair-haired Menelaös made him this answer:\n",
      "30\n",
      "‘You used not to be a fool, Eteōneus, Boēthoös’ son,\n",
      "hitherto: but now you’re babbling nonsense like a child!\n",
      "We two ate well and often as the guests of other men,\n",
      "generous hosts, on our way home, hoping only that Zeus\n",
      "might rid us of sorrows hereafter. So go, unyoke the horses\n",
      "35\n",
      "of these our guests, bring the guests themselves to the feast!”\n",
      "So he spoke. Eteōneus ran through the hall, calling out\n",
      "to his busy fellow attendants to follow along with him.\n",
      "They unharnessed the sweating horses from the yoke pole\n",
      "and tethered them by their reins at the mangers for horses,\n",
      "40\n",
      "scattering fodder for them, emmer mixed with white barley.\n",
      "Then they left the chariot resting against the white entrance walls\n",
      "and led their guests into the godlike domain. What they saw\n",
      "amazed them, passing through the abode of this king who was\n",
      "Zeus’ nursling: a brightness like that of the sun or moon\n",
      "45\n",
      "lit up the high-roofed dwelling of far-famed Menelaös.\n",
      "And when they’d feasted their eyes on this spectacle, they stepped\n",
      "into polished bathtubs and were bathed. Then, after\n",
      "maidservants had washed them, massaged them with oil,\n",
      "and clothed them in tunics and woolen mantles, they\n",
      "50\n",
      "sat down on high chairs next to Atreus’ son Menelaös.\n",
      "A handmaid fetched and poured them water from a pitcher—\n",
      "exquisite, golden—over a silver basin, for them\n",
      "to wash their hands, and placed a polished table nearby,\n",
      "while the dignified housekeeper brought bread, set it before them,\n",
      "55\n",
      "with various side dishes, giving freely of her provisions,\n",
      "and the carver loaded and brought to them platters of meat\n",
      "of every kind, and put golden goblets before them.\n",
      "Then fair-haired Menelaös welcomed them in these words:\n",
      "“Fall to, and enjoy yourselves! Afterwards, when you’ve eaten\n",
      "60\n",
      "your dinner, then we’ll question you as to who you may be\n",
      "among men, for in you two the ancestry’s not obscure—\n",
      "your mortal bloodline’s that of those sceptered princes,\n",
      "Zeus’ own nurslings: no commoner could have sired such sons.”\n",
      "With that he picked up and set before them the fat beef chine,\n",
      "65\n",
      "well roasted, that he himself had received as an honor. Then they\n",
      "reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\n",
      "But when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "then it was that Tēlemachos spoke to the son of Nestōr,\n",
      "head leaning close to him, so that others might not hear:\n",
      "70\n",
      "“Just look, son of Nestōr, friend dear to my heart, at all\n",
      "the bright shine of bronze throughout these echoing halls,\n",
      "the gleam of gold and amber, of silver and ivory!\n",
      "The court of Olympian Zeus must be like this inside,\n",
      "there’s such limitless wealth here: I’m awed by the sight of it!”\n",
      "75\n",
      "As he spoke, fair-haired Menelaös picked up what he said,\n",
      "and addressed them both as follows, in winged words:\n",
      "“Dear children, with Zeus no mortal might ever contend,\n",
      "for eternal are his residences and his possessions;\n",
      "but of men I might have a rival, or again I might not,\n",
      "80\n",
      "in possessions! True, after I’d suffered much, wandered far,\n",
      "I came back home in the eighth year, bringing my wealth\n",
      "in my ships, having visited Cyprus, Phoenicia, Egypt,\n",
      "the Aithiopes, the Sidonians, and the Eremboi,\n",
      "and Libya, where the lambkins grow horns almost from birth,\n",
      "85\n",
      "and the ewes give birth three times within a single year,\n",
      "so that neither master nor shepherd ever goes without\n",
      "cheese or mutton or sweet milk, but their flocks\n",
      "are ready for milking the whole year through. But while\n",
      "I was busy amassing a sizable livelihood as I roamed\n",
      "90\n",
      "from country to country, another man killed my brother3—\n",
      "secretly, caught him off guard, through the guile of his damned wife!\n",
      "So it gives me no pleasure to be lord of these possessions.\n",
      "Besides, you’ll have heard all this from your fathers, whoever\n",
      "they are, since I suffered greatly, losing a well-established\n",
      "95\n",
      "household, that contained many rare possessions!4 If only\n",
      "I could live in this house of mine with no more than a third\n",
      "part of those goods, and that all the men were alive still\n",
      "who died in broad Troy, far away from horse-grazing Argos!\n",
      "Yet though I so often weep and lament for them all\n",
      "100\n",
      "as I sit here in my home—at times I indulge my heart\n",
      "by mourning, but then again I’ll stop, for all too soon\n",
      "one reaches one’s surfeit of sorrow—nevertheless,\n",
      "despite my grief, I don’t mourn so much for them all\n",
      "as for that one, who makes me abhor both sleep and food\n",
      "105\n",
      "when I recall him: no other Achaian suffered such hardship\n",
      "or achieved as much as Odysseus, though for himself\n",
      "what was destined was trouble, and for me unforgettable\n",
      "endless grief over him: he’s been gone so long, we can’t tell\n",
      "if he’s living or dead! They must be mourning him now—\n",
      "110\n",
      "old Laërtēs, prudent Penelopē, and Tēlemachos, still\n",
      "a newborn child in the house at the time he left”—in whom,\n",
      "so speaking, he stirred the urge to mourn his father. Tears\n",
      "dropped from Tēlemachos’ eyelids as he heard his father’s name,\n",
      "and with both hands he held his purple mantle up\n",
      "115\n",
      "in front of his eyes. Menelaös took note of what he did,\n",
      "and turned over in his mind and in his heart the thought:\n",
      "should he let the boy mention his father first himself,\n",
      "or rather question him first, examine him on each matter?\n",
      "While he was debating thus, in his mind and heart,\n",
      "120\n",
      "Helen came in, from her fragrant high-roofed boudoir,\n",
      "like Artemis of the golden distaff, and with her Adrēstē,\n",
      "who brought out for her a finely made recliner,\n",
      "while Alkippē fetched her a rug of the softest wool,\n",
      "and Phylō a silver basket given her as a present\n",
      "125\n",
      "by Alkandrē, the wife of Polybos, who dwelt in Egyptian\n",
      "Thēbē, where the richest goods adorn all private homes:\n",
      "he made Menelaös a present of two silver bathtubs,\n",
      "a pair of tripods, and ten talents of gold.5 In addition\n",
      "his wife presented Helen with magnificent gifts:\n",
      "130\n",
      "a golden distaff she gave her, and a work basket on wheels,\n",
      "fashioned of silver, its rims all finished off with gold.\n",
      "It was this that her handmaid Phylō brought in and placed\n",
      "beside her, full of yarn already spun, and across it\n",
      "was laid the distaff, loaded with darkly violet wool.\n",
      "135\n",
      "Helen sat down in the recliner, a footstool under her feet,\n",
      "and at once let fly at her husband a row of questions:\n",
      "“Menelaös, nursling of Zeus, do we know who these men\n",
      "are, or say they are, who’ve come to our house? Shall I\n",
      "keep quiet or say what I think? Oh, I simply must tell you!\n",
      "140\n",
      "Not once did I ever see such a striking resemblance,\n",
      "in either a man or a woman—it truly astounds me!\n",
      "This boy could be the son of great-hearted Odysseus,\n",
      "Tēlemachos, left as a newborn child in the house\n",
      "by him, when because of me, the bitch, you Achaians\n",
      "145\n",
      "went out against Troy, hearts set on ruthless warfare.”\n",
      "Then fair-haired Menelaös responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“I too see the likeness now, wife, exactly as you perceive it:\n",
      "such as this boy’s were Odysseus’ feet and hands,\n",
      "and the way he’d glance, and his head, and the hair above it!\n",
      "150\n",
      "And when, just now, I was reminiscing about Odysseus,\n",
      "recounting all the sorrows and hardships that he endured\n",
      "on my behalf, the boy shed bitter tears from under\n",
      "his eyelids, held up that purple mantle before his eyes.”\n",
      "To him Peisistratos, Nestōr’s son, now responded, saying:\n",
      "155\n",
      "“Atreus’ son Menelaös, Zeus’ nursling, leader of troops,\n",
      "this youth is indeed his son, exactly as you tell it!\n",
      "But he’s also modest, and personally embarrassed\n",
      "by the thought of being too outspoken in what he says\n",
      "before you, whose voice delights us both like a god’s.\n",
      "160\n",
      "As for me, the Gerēnian horseman Nestōr sent me\n",
      "to be Tēlemachos’ escort, since he was eager to see you,\n",
      "and hoped you’d give him some encouraging word or action;\n",
      "for many troubles a son encounters at home when his father’s\n",
      "long absent, when he’s got no other supporters, as now\n",
      "165\n",
      "it is with Tēlemachos: his father’s away, nor are there\n",
      "any others among his people who’d stave off trouble from him.”\n",
      "Then fair-haired Menelaös responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Wonder of wonders! There’s come to my house the son\n",
      "of a man who’s my dear friend, who faced much hardship\n",
      "170\n",
      "on my account: when he came home, I figured I’d welcome him\n",
      "more than all other Argives—if we two ever got back over\n",
      "the sea in our swift ships, thanks to far-seeing Olympian Zeus!\n",
      "I’d have made some Argive town his, built a house there for him,\n",
      "fetched from Ithákē his son, his possessions, all his people—\n",
      "175\n",
      "expelling the population of one of those cities located\n",
      "round about, those that acknowledge me as their ruler.\n",
      "Both living here, we’d have seen a lot of each other: nothing\n",
      "would have kept us apart, away from friendship’s pleasures,\n",
      "until the black cloud of death in the end enfolded us!\n",
      "180\n",
      "But the god himself, I suppose, resented such a prospect,\n",
      "and denied a safe homecoming to that unlucky man alone.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and stirred in them all an urge to lamentation:\n",
      "Argive Helen, daughter of Zeus, shed tears now,\n",
      "and Tēlemachos wept, as did Atreus’ son Menelaös,\n",
      "185\n",
      "nor could the son of Nestōr keep his eyes tearless, as he\n",
      "recalled in his heart the peerless Antilochos,\n",
      "slain by the bright Dawn’s glorious son.6 So now,\n",
      "thinking of him, he uttered winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Son of Atreus, old Nestōr would always refer to you as\n",
      "190\n",
      "the most sagacious of men, when your name came up\n",
      "in his halls, when questions arose between us: so now,\n",
      "if it’s possible, do me a favor! I’m not the sort of man\n",
      "to hold sad discussions at dinner: next morning’s soon enough\n",
      "for that kind of thing. Of course, I’m not against\n",
      "195\n",
      "grieving for any mortal who’s died and met his fate:\n",
      "this is the only due we pay to wretched mortals,\n",
      "to crop our hair, and let the tears course down our cheeks!\n",
      "For a brother of mine, too, is dead, one far from the meanest\n",
      "of Argives—you may well have known him, though I myself\n",
      "200\n",
      "never met nor saw him: still, they say that Antilochos\n",
      "excelled all others both as a runner and as a fighter.”\n",
      "Then fair-haired Menelaös responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Friend, what you’ve said is all that any sagacious man\n",
      "could say or do, even one who was older than you are!\n",
      "205\n",
      "Such a father is yours, as your careful speech makes clear.\n",
      "Easily known is the offspring of that man for whom\n",
      "Kronos’ son spins good fortune in his marriage and his children,\n",
      "as now he has granted Nestōr, through all his days,\n",
      "to reach old age at home in prosperity, with his sons\n",
      "210\n",
      "proving themselves both sharp-witted and expert spearmen.\n",
      "So we’ll leave off the weeping that recently took place,\n",
      "and let’s turn our minds back to dinner—let them pour water\n",
      "over our hands! Time enough tomorrow morning\n",
      "for me and Tēlemachos to have a full discussion.”\n",
      "215\n",
      "So he spoke, and Asphaliōn poured water on their hands—\n",
      "Asphaliōn, busy squire of renowned Menelaös. They now\n",
      "reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\n",
      "Then Helen, daughter of Zeus, had another idea: at once\n",
      "into the wine they were drinking she added a drug\n",
      "220\n",
      "that banishes grief and anger, brings oblivion of all ills:\n",
      "whoever swallowed it when mixed into the bowl\n",
      "would not, for the rest of that day, wet his cheeks with tears,\n",
      "even though his mother and father should lie there dead,\n",
      "or a brother or dear son should be killed in his presence,\n",
      "225\n",
      "cut down by the sword, and his own eyes witnessed it—\n",
      "so powerful were the drugs that this daughter of Zeus possessed,\n",
      "benign ones, a present from Thōn’s wife Polydamna,\n",
      "a native of Egypt; for there the grain-giving earth bears most\n",
      "drugs—many healing in mixture, and many malignant:\n",
      "230\n",
      "each man there’s a physician, more knowledgeable than all\n",
      "mankind elsewhere, for indeed they are of Paiēōn’s race.\n",
      "So when she’d added the drug and had the wine poured out,\n",
      "at once she spoke again, and responded to them, saying:\n",
      "“Atreus’ son Menelaös, Zeus’ nursling, and you other sons\n",
      "235\n",
      "of excellent sires! Now to one man, now to another\n",
      "the god, Zeus, gives good or ill, for he can do anything; so\n",
      "feast on, sitting here in our halls at your ease, and enjoy\n",
      "listening to tales: I’ll tell one that fits this occasion well!\n",
      "I can’t rehearse or enumerate all the many trials\n",
      "240\n",
      "of steadfast-minded Odysseus, but there is this one exploit,\n",
      "performed and endured by the mighty warrior in\n",
      "the Trojans’ land, where you Achaians endured troubles!\n",
      "He scourged his own person with harsh unseemly blows,\n",
      "flung rags about his shoulders to look like a menial,\n",
      "245\n",
      "and slipped into the enemy’s wide-wayed city,\n",
      "concealing himself in the likeness of another, a beggar,\n",
      "quite different from the real man at the Achaians’ ships.\n",
      "Thus disguised he entered the Trojans’ city, unrecognized\n",
      "by them all: I alone perceived who he really was,\n",
      "250\n",
      "and questioned him; he in his cunning dodged my enquiries.\n",
      "But after I’d bathed him and rubbed him down with oil,\n",
      "and put good clothes on him, and swore a mighty oath\n",
      "not to reveal him as Odysseus among the Trojans\n",
      "until he was safely back to the swift ships and the huts,\n",
      "255\n",
      "then at last he told me all the plans of the Achaians;\n",
      "and—after he’d killed many Trojans with the keen-edged bronze—\n",
      "got back to the Argives, brought them much information.\n",
      "The other Trojan women wailed in grief, but my own\n",
      "spirit rejoiced, since already my heart was set to return\n",
      "260\n",
      "back home, and I groaned for the blindness that Aphrodītē\n",
      "had inflicted in leading me there, away from my dear country,\n",
      "abandoning my own child, my bedchamber, my husband—\n",
      "who was lacking in nothing, either brains or looks.”\n",
      "Then fair-haired Menelaös responded to her, saying:\n",
      "265\n",
      "“All this indeed, my wife, you have stated correctly.\n",
      "Long since have I come to know the minds and counsel\n",
      "of many heroic men, and have traveled widely,\n",
      "but never yet have I met and studied such a person\n",
      "as steadfast Odysseus was at heart; nor have I known\n",
      "270\n",
      "so striking a deed as that great man devised and achieved\n",
      "in the carpentered Horse, where we—all the very best\n",
      "of the Argives—sat, bringing death and destiny\n",
      "to the Trojans. You came then—maybe impelled\n",
      "by a god determined to grant the Trojans some glory—\n",
      "275\n",
      "and godlike Deïphobos along with you. Three times\n",
      "you circled the hollow ambush, tapping its surface,\n",
      "calling out to all the Danaän leaders by name,\n",
      "imitating the voice of each of the Argives’ wives.\n",
      "Now I and the son of Tydeus, with noble Odysseus,\n",
      "280\n",
      "were sitting inside, and could hear the way you were calling.\n",
      "Diomēdēs and I were both eager to jump from our seats\n",
      "and emerge, or at least to answer you from inside;\n",
      "but Odysseus, despite our longing, held us back in place.\n",
      "Then all the Achaians’ sons kept silent except for\n",
      "285\n",
      "Antiklos, who was still determined to answer you,\n",
      "had not Odysseus kept his mouth firmly shut\n",
      "with his great powerful hands, and saved all us Achaians\n",
      "by holding firm until Pallas Athēnē led you from us.”\n",
      "Then sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "290\n",
      "“Atreus’ son Menelaös, Zeus’ nursling, leader of troops,\n",
      "so much the worse, for this didn’t ward off grim destruction\n",
      "from him, nor would have done, had his heart within been of iron!\n",
      "So come now, dispatch us to bed, so that we without delay\n",
      "may settle down and enjoy the pleasures of sweet sleep.”\n",
      "295\n",
      "So he spoke, and Argive Helen gave orders to her handmaids\n",
      "to set bedsteads under the colonnade, and lay upon them\n",
      "fine purple wool throws, and over these to spread blankets,\n",
      "topped off with fleecy mantles that would serve as coverlets.\n",
      "Out from the hall went the handmaids, each holding a torch,\n",
      "300\n",
      "and made up the beds. A herald escorted the guests.\n",
      "They then lay down to sleep there, in the dwelling’s forecourt,\n",
      "the hero Tēlemachos and Nestōr’s splendid son;\n",
      "but Atreus’ son slept in a back room of the high house,\n",
      "and by him lay long-robed Helen, resplendent among women.\n",
      "305\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "Menelaös of the great war cry rose from the bed he’d slept in,\n",
      "put on his clothes, slung a sharp sword from one shoulder,\n",
      "tied on a pair of sandals under his sleek feet,\n",
      "sallied forth from his chamber, in appearance like a god,\n",
      "310\n",
      "sat down beside Tēlemachos, and addressed him as follows:\n",
      "‘What need was it brought you here, heroic Tēlemachos,\n",
      "to sunny Lakedaimōn, over the broad back of the sea?\n",
      "Something public, or personal? Tell me the truth of this.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos answered him: “Atreus’ son,\n",
      "315\n",
      "Menelaös, Zeus’ nursling, leader of troops, I came\n",
      "in the hope you might be able to tell me news of my father.\n",
      "My estate is being eaten up and my rich farms ruined,\n",
      "my house is crowded with foes who continue to slaughter\n",
      "my flocks of sheep and my crumple-horned shambling cattle—\n",
      "320\n",
      "these arrogant, overweening suitors of my mother!\n",
      "That’s why I’m here at your knees now—you might be willing\n",
      "to tell me about his grim death, if you maybe saw it\n",
      "yourself, or heard an account of it from some other\n",
      "wanderer: to unmatched misery his mother bore him!\n",
      "325\n",
      "And don’t, from concern or pity, speak false comfort to me,\n",
      "but tell me exactly whatever you may have witnessed!\n",
      "I beseech you, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, made you\n",
      "any promise, by word or action, and delivered on it\n",
      "in the land of the Trojans, where you Achaians met grief,\n",
      "330\n",
      "remember it now, and tell me the unerring truth of it.”\n",
      "Deeply troubled, fair-haired Menelaös now addressed him:\n",
      "“I tell you, it was indeed in the bed of a brave warrior\n",
      "that these fellows, cowards themselves, hoped they might lie!\n",
      "As when in a thicket, the lair of a powerful lion,\n",
      "335\n",
      "a doe has laid to sleep her newborn suckling fawns,\n",
      "and goes off, traversing foothills and grassy glens\n",
      "in search of pasture, and the lion returns to his den\n",
      "and on both her fawns unleashes a ghastly fate—just so\n",
      "will Odysseus unleash a ghastly fate on these men!\n",
      "340\n",
      "How I wish—by Zeus the Father and Athēnē and Apollo!—\n",
      "that he, as strong as he was that time in well-built Lesbos\n",
      "when he stood up and wrestled a bout with Philomeleidēs,\n",
      "and threw him down forcefully, and all the Achaians cheered,\n",
      "might come—he, Odysseus—in such strength among these suitors!\n",
      "345\n",
      "Then they’d all get a swift end and a bitter marriage!\n",
      "As regards the business you’re enquiring about, I shan’t\n",
      "veer off onto other subjects, nor will I mislead you—\n",
      "of all that I heard from the forthright Old Man of the Sea\n",
      "not one word will I keep back or conceal from you!\n",
      "350\n",
      "“Though I longed to return here, the gods still held me back\n",
      "in Egypt, since I’d not offered them adequate sacrifices—\n",
      "gods always want mortals to bear their behests in mind!\n",
      "Well, there exists an island set in the surging sea,\n",
      "offshore from Egypt: Pharos, they call it, as far out\n",
      "355\n",
      "as a hollow ship can cover in one whole day\n",
      "with a tailwind strong and constant blowing behind it;\n",
      "there’s a harbor there with good anchorage, where men\n",
      "take on water before sailing out in their trim ships.\n",
      "There for twenty days the gods stayed me, nor ever did\n",
      "360\n",
      "those maritime tailwinds show up that escort ships\n",
      "safely across the sea’s broad back; so all my stores\n",
      "would have been eaten up, and my crew’s strength with them,\n",
      "had not one of the gods shown compassion and rescued me—\n",
      "the daughter of mighty Prōteus, the Old Man of the Sea,\n",
      "365\n",
      "Eidotheē: it was her heart I’d stirred in particular when\n",
      "she encountered me straying alone, far away from my comrades,\n",
      "who’d gone out round the island, engaged in fishing\n",
      "with bent hooks, since starvation was crimping their bellies.\n",
      "She it was who approached now, and addressed me, saying:\n",
      "370\n",

      "The way you’re stuck on this island, unable to discover\n",
      "any way out, and your men near to despairing!’\n",

      "380\n",
      "and how I’m to get back home, across the fish-rich sea.’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and at once she, bright among goddesses, said:\n",
      "‘Well, stranger, I’ll give you a full and accurate answer.\n",
      "There’s a certain Old Man of the Sea—he often comes here—\n",
      "immortal and truthful—Prōteus of Egypt, who knows\n",
      "385\n",
      "the depths of every sea, a servant of Poseidōn:\n",
      "they say he’s my father, that he begot me. Now if\n",
      "you could somehow lie in wait and get hold of him, then\n",
      "he could tell you about your return, the details of your journey,\n",
      "all your long voyage homeward across the fish-rich sea.\n",
      "390\n",
      "What’s more, Zeus’ nursling, if you wanted, he could relate\n",
      "what’s been done in your halls, for both good and evil,\n",
      "while you were away on your long and arduous journey.’\n",
      "“So she spoke, and I then made answer to her, saying:\n",
      "‘Show me yourself now how to ambush this old immortal—\n",
      "395\n",
      "he might see me beforehand, be alerted, avoid me:\n",
      "it’s hard for a mere mortal to overpower a god.’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and at once she, bright among goddesses, said:\n",
      "‘Well, stranger, I’ll give you a full and accurate answer.\n",
      "At the time that the sun has risen to span mid-heaven\n",
      "400\n",
      "this truthful Old Man of the Sea emerges from the waves\n",
      "with the breath of the west wind, concealed by a dark ripple.\n",
      "When he’s out, he lies down to sleep in the hollow caves,\n",
      "and around him the seals,7 the sweet sea daughter’s brood,8\n",
      "come up out of the grey sea water, fall asleep together,\n",
      "405\n",
      "exhaling a pungent reek of the sea’s far-reaching depths.\n",
      "I’ll take you there tomorrow as dawn is breaking\n",
      "and settle you down in a row—you must carefully choose\n",
      "three of your comrades, the best in your strong-benched ships—\n",
      "and tell you about all the tricks of the old man. First,\n",
      "410\n",
      "he’ll count the number of seals, go over them all;\n",
      "but when he’s totted them up and reviewed them, then\n",
      "he’ll bed down in the midst of them, like a shepherd among his flock.\n",
      "Now as soon as you see him settled, then will be the time\n",
      "to muster up every last drop of your strength and vigor,\n",
      "415\n",
      "and hold him firm, though he’ll struggle mightily to escape.\n",
      "He’ll test you by turning into every creature that comes forth\n",
      "and moves on the earth, into water, into devouring fire;\n",
      "yet keep him pinned down, hold on to him all the harder!\n",
      "But when at last he questions you in his own person,\n",
      "420\n",
      "in that shape he had when you watched him settling down,\n",
      "then, hero, cease your violence, set the old man free,\n",
      "ask him which of the gods it is that’s angry with you\n",
      "and your homecoming, how you’re to traverse the fish-rich sea.’\n",
      "“That said, she dived down into the surging deep,\n",
      "425\n",
      "and I returned to my ships, drawn up on the beach,\n",
      "my heart brooding darkly on many things as I went.\n",
      "Then, after we’d gone on down to our ship and the sea,\n",
      "and made ready our meal, and ambrosial9 night came on,\n",
      "we lay down to sleep there, beside the breaking surf.\n",
      "430\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "then indeed along the strand of the broad-wayed sea\n",
      "I went, praying much to the gods, and taking with me\n",
      "the three comrades I most trusted for every venture.\n",
      "“She meanwhile had plunged down into the sea’s broad gulf\n",
      "435\n",
      "and fetched up from the deep the skins of four seals, all\n",
      "recently flayed: she’d thought up a trick against her father.\n",
      "She dug out hollow forms in the sandy beach, and sat there,\n",
      "waiting. So we came right up to her, and she made us\n",
      "lie down in a row, threw a skin over each of us. Now\n",
      "440\n",
      "our ambush would have been torture, for most horribly\n",
      "did the vile stench of these brine-bred seals revolt us—\n",
      "who’d choose to bed down beside a beast from the sea?—\n",
      "had she herself not rescued us, devised a great remedy:\n",
      "she brought and positioned ambrosia under each man’s nose,\n",
      "445\n",
      "that breathed sweet fragrance, destroying the sea beast’s stink.\n",
      "So all that morning we waited, with enduring patience,\n",
      "till the seals came crowding up from the water and then\n",
      "settled themselves in lines along the seashore. At noon\n",
      "the old man emerged from the sea, to find his well-nourished\n",
      "450\n",
      "seals: he inspected them all and checked their number,\n",
      "counting us first among the beasts, never once suspecting\n",
      "the trick we’d played. Then he too lay down to rest.\n",
      "So we with a shout sprang on him, locked him in our arms;\n",
      "But the old man hadn’t forgotten his own elusive arts,\n",
      "455\n",
      "far from it: first he became a bearded lion,\n",
      "then a serpent, then a leopard, then a gigantic boar;\n",
      "then he turned into flowing water, and a tall leafy tree;\n",
      "but with resolute heart we kept him firmly pinned down,\n",
      "and when the cunning old trickster was at last exhausted\n",
      "460\n",
      "then he finally spoke and questioned me, saying: ‘Which\n",
      "of the gods, son of Atreus, was it advised you how to ambush\n",
      "and catch me against my will? What is it that you want?’\n",
      "“So he spoke, and I then made answer to him, saying:\n",
      "‘You yourself know, old man—why try to trick me with\n",
      "465\n",
      "this question?—how long I’ve been stuck here on this island,\n",
      "unable to find a way out, my inner spirit fading: so you\n",
      "tell me—since gods are all-knowing—which immortal\n",
      "is it who fetters me here, who’s kept me from my journey—\n",
      "and how I’m to get back home across the fish-rich sea.’\n",
      "470\n",
      "“So I spoke: he at once made answer to me, saying:\n",
      "‘You should have made rich sacrifices to Zeus and the other gods\n",
      "before embarking, to ensure your speedy return\n",
      "to your own country, voyaging over the wine-dark deep!\n",
      "For it isn’t your fate to set eyes on your friends, or make it\n",
      "475\n",
      "back to your well-set home and your ancestral country\n",
      "before you’ve once more been to the waters of Egypt’s\n",
      "heaven-fed river and offered ample sacrifices\n",
      "to the immortal gods who hold wide heaven: only\n",
      "then, at last, will they grant you the journey that you desire.’\n",
      "480\n",
      "“So he spoke; but the heart within me was shattered\n",
      "by his sending me back again to traverse the misty deep\n",
      "to Egypt, a lengthy and most wearisome journey.\n",
      "Yet even so I still responded to him, saying:\n",
      "‘All this I shall do, old man, exactly as you bid me.\n",
      "485\n",
      "But come now, tell me this, give me a true report:\n",
      "Did all the Achaians get home with their ships, unharmed,\n",
      "all those Nestōr and I left when we set out from Troy?\n",
      "Or did any die by some unkind fate on shipboard,\n",
      "or in their friends’ arms, after winding up the war?’\n",
      "490\n",
      "“So I spoke: he at once made answer to me, saying:\n",
      "‘Son of Atreus, why ask me this? It’s not your business\n",
      "to know or search out my mind—nor do I think\n",
      "you’ll long be tearless when you hear the full account!\n",
      "For many of them perished, and many were left there,\n",
      "495\n",
      "though only two leaders of the bronze-corseleted Achaians\n",
      "died when returning home, or in the war—you were there then!—\n",
      "and one may still be alive, held back out there on the deep.\n",
      "Aias10 was done for, along with his long-oared vessels:\n",
      "first Poseidōn drove him onto the massive rocks\n",
      "500\n",
      "of Gyrai, yet rescued him, brought him safe from the sea;\n",
      "and he’d have escaped his fate, though hated by Athēnē,\n",
      "had he not, infatuate, uttered a reckless boast, asserted\n",
      "that it was in spite of the gods he’d escaped the sea’s\n",
      "great gulf, so that Poseidōn, hearing his noisy bragging,\n",
      "505\n",
      "at once took hold of the trident in his mighty fists\n",
      "and struck the rock face of Gyrai, split a part off.\n",
      "The rock held firm, but the fragment where Aias was perched\n",
      "when he made his reckless boast crashed into the sea,\n",
      "bore him down with it into the boundless surging main,\n",
      "510\n",
      "so he swallowed his fill of salt water, and thus perished.\n",
      "‘But your brother somehow escaped, eluded the death spirits\n",
      "with his hollow ships: it was the lady Hērē who saved him.\n",
      "Then, when he was nearing Malea’s sheer promontory,\n",
      "a strong gale took hold of him, carried him headlong\n",
      "515\n",
      "over the fish-rich waters, groaning disconsolately,\n",
      "to the coast of that land where in time past Thyestēs\n",
      "had his abode, but now his son Aigisthos dwelt there.\n",
      "Yet from this point too an unharmed return was shown him:\n",
      "The gods changed the gale to a tailwind, and they got home.\n",
      "520\n",
      "Now he, Agamemnōn, rejoicing, set foot on his native soil,\n",
      "laid hold of the earth and kissed it, a flood of warm tears\n",
      "streamed down his face, so glad he was to see his homeland.\n",
      "‘But a watch at his lookout saw him, a man brought in\n",
      "and set there by crafty Aigisthos, who promised him a reward,\n",
      "525\n",
      "two talents of gold: he’d been keeping watch for a year now\n",
      "in case he slipped past unseen, fierce valor not forgotten.\n",
      "Now the watchman went to the palace, informed the people’s\n",
      "shepherd: Aigisthos at once thought up a crafty scheme:\n",
      "he chose twenty men, the best fighters in the region,\n",
      "530\n",
      "and placed them in ambush, but across the hall laid on\n",
      "a feast, then took horses and chariots to welcome Agamemnōn,\n",
      "the people’s shepherd, mind set on treacherous action,\n",
      "and brought him back, unaware of his coming fate, and after\n",
      "feasting him killed him, the way you’d butcher an ox at its crib.\n",
      "535\n",
      "Not one of all Atreus’ son’s comrades remained alive there,\n",
      "not one of Aigisthos’ men:11 they all died in the halls.’\n",
      "“So he spoke, and the spirit within me was shattered.\n",
      "And I wept as I sat on the sand there, my heart no longer\n",
      "wanted to live, to behold the sunlight. But after\n",
      "540\n",
      "I’d had my fill of weeping and groveling, then\n",
      "the forthright Old Man of the Sea addressed me, saying:\n",
      "‘No longer, son of Atreus, waste time like this in ceaseless\n",
      "weeping: no good will come of it! Rather do all you can\n",
      "to get back soon to your country: there’s always a chance\n",
      "545\n",
      "of finding that man alive still—if Orestēs hasn’t arrived first\n",
      "and killed him, and you only get there in time for the funeral.’\n",
      "“So he spoke, and the heart and proud spirit once again\n",
      "were cheered in my breast, despite the grief I felt,\n",
      "and I spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "550\n",
      "‘These men I know of. But tell me, who’s the third man,\n",
      "the one who may be alive still, held back out there on the main—\n",
      "or is he dead? Though it grieve me, I want to hear the truth.’\n",
      "“So I spoke: he at once made answer to me, saying:\n",
      "‘That is the son of Laërtēs, whose dwelling is in Ithákē:\n",
      "555\n",
      "him I saw on an island, shedding copious tears,\n",
      "in the home of the nymph Kalypsō, who by constraint\n",
      "detains him there, so he can’t get back to his own country,\n",
      "for he has no ships with oars, nor any comrades\n",
      "to further his voyage over the broad back of the sea.\n",
      "560\n",
      "But it isn’t your destiny, Menelaös, Zeus’ nursling,\n",
      "to die and meet your fate in horse-grazing Argos: rather\n",
      "it’s to the Elysian plain and the furthest ends of the earth\n",
      "that the immortals will bring you, where fair-haired Rhadamanthys\n",
      "dwells, and where the living is easiest for mankind:\n",
      "565\n",
      "no snow’s there, no strong storms, nor ever any rain,\n",
      "but a constant light western breeze coming up off the ocean\n",
      "to provide mankind with cooling relief; for as they see it,\n",
      "since you have Helen as wife, you’re a son-in-law of Zeus.’\n",
      "“That said, he plunged down into the surging deep;\n",
      "570\n",
      "and I returned to the ships with my godlike comrades,\n",
      "my heart brooding darkly on many things as I went.\n",
      "Then after we’d gone on down to our ship and the sea,\n",
      "and made ready our meal, and ambrosial night came on,\n",
      "we lay down to sleep there, beside the breaking surf.\n",
      "575\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "our ships first of all we hauled into the bright salt sea,\n",
      "and set up the masts and sails in these well-trimmed vessels.\n",
      "Then the men went aboard, and sat down on the benches,\n",
      "and ranged in close order struck the grey sea with their oars.\n",
      "580\n",
      "So back to Egypt, land of the heaven-fed river, I brought\n",
      "and moored my vessels, and offered most lavish sacrifices;\n",
      "and when I’d appeased the wrath of the gods that are forever\n",
      "I raised Agamemnōn a grave mound, that his fame might be\n",
      "undying. That done, I set sail for home. The immortals\n",
      "585\n",
      "gave me a tailwind, conveyed me to my own dear land.\n",
      "So come now, stay on with me longer here in my halls,\n",
      "for eleven or twelve more days, and after that\n",
      "I’ll arrange you a proper send-off, with some splendid gifts—\n",
      "three horses, a well-polished chariot. In addition\n",
      "590\n",
      "I’ll give you a beautiful cup: then, when you pour libations\n",
      "to the deathless gods, you’ll remember me all your days.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Son of Atreus, please don’t invite me to stay here longer!\n",
      "Truth is, I’d be only too happy to sit on for a full year\n",
      "595\n",
      "in your abode here, home and parents all forgotten,\n",
      "so rare is the pleasure I get from listening to your stories\n",
      "and the way you tell them! But already my comrades are fretting\n",
      "to leave sacred Pylos, you’re keeping me here so long!\n",
      "As for the present you give me, make that a keepsake:\n",
      "600\n",
      "horses I’ll not take back to Ithákē, but rather leave them\n",
      "here for your pleasure, since you are lord of a spacious\n",
      "plain with an abundance of clover and galingale,\n",
      "of wheat and millet and ample-grained white barley.\n",
      "But Ithákē has no broad courses, nor any meadows; it gives\n",
      "605\n",
      "pasture to goats—more attractive than that for horses!\n",
      "None of the islands has meadows or space for chariots:\n",
      "each of them slopes down seaward, Ithákē most of all.”\n",
      "So he spoke. Menelaös of the great war cry smiled,\n",
      "caressed him with one hand, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "610\n",
      "“The way you talk, dear child, reveals your good breeding!\n",
      "I’ll change these presents, then, since I can: of all the gifts\n",
      "laid away in my house as personal treasures I shall\n",
      "give you the one that’s most beautiful and most costly:\n",
      "a finely wrought mixing bowl, made all of silver throughout,\n",
      "615\n",
      "rims finished off with a golden inlay, the work\n",
      "of Hephaistos, a present from the hero Phaidimos,\n",
      "the Sidonians’ king, at the time that his house gave me shelter\n",
      "when I’d got that far homeward. This I’d like you to have.”\n",
      "Such were the words they exchanged between one another,\n",
      "620\n",
      "while the banqueters were arriving at the godlike king’s domain:\n",
      "they drove up sheep, they brought beneficent wine,\n",
      "their fine-veiled wives came with them, carrying bread.\n",
      "Thus they busied themselves about the feast in the halls.\n",
      "Meanwhile the suitors gathered in front of Odysseus’ abode\n",
      "625\n",
      "were amusing themselves, in their usual arrogant fashion,\n",
      "by throwing the discus and javelin out on a leveled terrace\n",
      "where Antinoös and godlike Eurymachos were sitting—\n",
      "the suitors’ leaders, by far the best-born among them.\n",
      "They were approached now by Phronios’ son Noēmōn,\n",
      "630\n",
      "who addressed Antinoös, had this question for him:\n",
      "“Antinoös, do we or don’t we know for certain when\n",
      "Tēlemachos will get back here from sandy Pylos? He went\n",
      "taking a ship of mine, and now I have need of it\n",
      "to go over to widespread Ēlis, where I’ve a dozen\n",
      "635\n",
      "brood mares, now suckling young mules, unbroken, hard\n",
      "workers: I want to drive one off, break it in.”\n",
      "So he spoke. They were quietly astonished, had no idea\n",
      "that Tēlemachos had gone to Nēleian Pylos, believed him\n",
      "somewhere out in the fields, with his flocks or at the swineherd’s.\n",
      "640\n",
      "Antinoös, Eupeithēs’ son, now responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“When exactly did he leave? And who were those young men\n",
      "that went with him? Select Ithákans, or just his own\n",
      "field hands and household servants? This too he could have done.\n",
      "And give me a true answer, I need to be quite certain:\n",
      "645\n",
      "Was it by force, against your will, that he took your black ship,\n",
      "or did you give it him freely because he asked you for it?”\n",
      "Noēmōn, the son of Phronios, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“I gave it him freely myself. What would anyone do\n",
      "when a man of his sort, with the troubles he has at heart,\n",
      "650\n",
      "made the request? To not give it him would be hard.\n",
      "As for the youths, those gone with him are Ithákē’s best\n",
      "after ourselves: I noticed their leader embarking and he\n",
      "was Mentōr—or else some god who looked just like him.\n",
      "It’s an odd thing: I saw godlike Mentōr here yesterday\n",
      "655\n",
      "at dawn, but in fact he’d left then in the ship to Pylos.”\n",
      "This said, he took himself off to his father’s house,\n",
      "leaving the proud hearts of both highly disconcerted. They\n",
      "at once made the suitors quit their games and sit down,\n",
      "and among them Antinoös, Eupeithēs’ son, now spoke,\n",
      "660\n",
      "bitterly troubled, his black heart brimming over\n",
      "with rage, while his eyes had the semblance of blazing fire.\n",
      "“An outrageous act, I swear, most high-handedly brought off,\n",
      "this trip by Tēlemachos! And we thought he’d never make it!\n",
      "Despite all of us here, the brat’s gone, just like that—\n",
      "665\n",
      "got a ship, launched it, enrolled the best men we have!\n",
      "Pretty soon he’ll be trouble for us: so may Zeus\n",
      "destroy his power before he ever comes to full manhood!\n",
      "Come then, give me a fast ship and twenty comrades,\n",
      "so I can set an ambush, watch for him as he steers\n",
      "670\n",
      "through the narrows between Ithákē and sheer beetling Samē,\n",
      "and give him a miserable voyage in his quest for his father!”\n",
      "So he spoke: they all assented, backed his proposal,\n",
      "got up at once, and went off to the house of Odysseus.\n",
      "Nor was Penelopē left for long without knowledge\n",
      "675\n",
      "of the schemes that the suitors hatched in secret discussion,\n",
      "for Medōn the herald told her, who, outside the courtyard,\n",
      "heard the whole plot that they, inside, were weaving,\n",
      "and went in through the hall to inform Penelopē of it.\n",
      "As he set foot across the threshold Penelopē addressed him:\n",
      "680\n",
      "“Herald, for what have the lordly suitors now dispatched you?\n",

      "800\n",
      "that she should give over her grief, her tearful lamentation.\n",
      "Into her room it wafted, round the strap of the door bolt,\n",
      "and stood there above her head, and addressed her, saying:\n",
      "“Are you asleep, Penelopē, heart still heavy with grief?\n",
      "The gods, the easy livers, won’t have it that you should be\n",
      "805\n",
      "weeping and grieving: return home is yet destined for your son,\n",
      "since in the gods’ eyes he’s no kind of transgressor.”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē made it this answer, as she\n",

      "“Why have you come here, sister? Never until now\n",
      "810\n",
      "would you visit: the home you live in lies far away.\n",
      "And now you tell me to quit the grieving, the countless\n",
      "agonies that beset me in mind and soul! Years ago\n",
      "I lost my good husband: a lion’s heart he possessed,\n",
      "and stood out among the Danaäns for every kind of virtue:\n",
      "815\n",
      "a fine man—wide is his fame through Hellas and mid-Argos!\n",
      "And now my beloved son, too, has left in a hollow ship—\n",
      "a mere child, with no knowledge of hardship or public debate.\n",
      "For him it is that I grieve, even more than for the other:\n",
      "I tremble for him, I’m afraid of what he might suffer\n",
      "820\n",
      "in the land of those he’s gone to, or out on the deep sea.\n",
      "for many ill-wishers are plotting against him, eager\n",
      "to kill him before he gets back to his own country.”\n",
      "In answer to her the dark phantom now declared:\n",
      "“Take heart, don’t let your mind be overweighed by panic:\n",
      "825\n",
      "a guide goes with him such as other men have prayed\n",
      "to have at their side, since hers is indeed the power—\n",
      "Pallas Athēnē! She feels compassion for you in your sorrow.\n",
      "and it’s she who has sent me here to bring you this message.”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē made this reply to her, saying:\n",
      "830\n",
      "“If you’re indeed a god, and have heard this word from the goddess,\n",
      "then come tell me the truth about that man of sorrows—\n",
      "can it be that he’s still alive, a witness to the sunlight,\n",
      "or is he already dead, and in Hades’ realm?”\n",
      "The dark\n",
      "phantom then answered her in these words, saying: “No,\n",

      "about him I shall tell you nothing plainly as to\n",
      "whether he lives or is dead. A bad thing, windy chatter.”\n",
      "So saying, it slipped out by way of the door bolt into\n",
      "the draught of the winds. But she, Ikarios’ daughter,\n",
      "started up from her sleep, her heart greatly comforted\n",
      "840\n",
      "that so clear a dream had reached her in the dark of the night.\n",
      "Now the suitors embarked and sailed the watery routes,\n",

      "There’s a rocky islet, Asteris, out in the midst of the deep,\n",
      "halfway between Ithákē and rugged Samē, not large\n",
      "845\n",
      "but double-harbored, safe mooring for ships; and there\n",
      "the Achaians set up an ambush, and waited for him.\n",
      "Book 5\n",
      "As Dawn arose from her bed beside illustrious Tithōnos,\n",
      "to bring light to the immortals and to mortal mankind,\n",
      "the gods were taking their seats in assembly, and among them\n",
      "Zeus the high-thunderer, whose power is the greatest.\n",
      "Athēnē was speaking, reminding them of Odysseus’ many woes,\n",
      "5\n",
      "much concerned by his being in the nymph’s home: “Zeus,\n",

      "Yet now he’s stuck on an island, suffering sore affliction\n",
      "in the nymph Kalypsō’s abode: she is keeping him there\n",
      "under duress. He cannot return to his own country,\n",
      "15\n",
      "for he hasn’t to hand any oared ships or companions\n",

      "20\n",
      "Then in answer cloud-gathering Zeus addressed her, saying:\n",
      "“My child, what’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth?\n",
      "Did not you yourself think up the scheme whereby\n",
      "Odysseus at his homecoming might be revenged on these men?\n",

      "go inform the fair-haired nymph of my firm decision\n",
      "30\n",
      "regarding the return of steadfast-minded Odysseus:\n",
      "he’s to travel without the conveyance of gods or mortals,\n",
      "on a tightly lashed raft, and enduring much hardship,\n",
      "making landfall, twenty days on, at rich-soiled Scheria,\n",
      "country of the Phaiakians, who are close kin to the gods.\n",
      "35\n",
      "They will honor him like a god, most heartily, and send him\n",
      "aboard a ship of theirs to his own native country,\n",
      "with generous gifts of bronze and gold and clothing,\n",
      "more than Odysseus could ever have got for himself from Troy\n",

      "40\n",
      "This is how he’s fated to rejoin his own people, come back\n",

      "and the boundless earth, as swift as a gale’s blast;\n",

      "Holding this, the strong Argos-slayer was airborne, flew\n",
      "from the high sky over Pieria, swooped down on the sea,\n",
      "50\n",
      "then skimmed over the waves like a shearwater that flies\n",
      "along the fearsome gulfs of the unharvested deep\n",
      "hunting for fish, and wets its whirring wings in the brine—\n",
      "just so did Hermes traverse that expanse of waves\n",
      "until he finally reached the far-distant island.\n",
      "55\n",
      "Then he abandoned the violet deep for dry land,\n",
      "made his way to the great cave where the fair-tressed nymph\n",
      "had her abode, and found her at home. A great fire\n",
      "was ablaze on the hearth: the fragrance of split cedar\n",
      "and citron wood burning spread far over the island,\n",
      "60\n",
      "while she, within there, singing in a sweet voice,\n",
      "went to and fro at the loom, wove with a golden shuttle.\n",
      "Around the cave there flourished woodland in abundance—\n",
      "alder, black poplar, and fragrant cypress—in which\n",
      "spread-winged birds had fashioned their nesting places:\n",
      "65\n",
      "small horned owls, falcons, and those chattering seabirds,\n",
      "cormorants, that busy themselves far out in deep water.\n",
      "Encircling the hollow cavern there trailed a luxuriant\n",
      "garden vine, with plentiful ripe grape clusters\n",

      "70\n",
      "close to each other, yet facing in different directions,\n",
      "and beyond them soft meadows of blossoming violets\n",
      "and celery: whoever might come there—an immortal, even—\n",
      "would admire the sight, and rejoice in his heart, as now\n",
      "the guide, the slayer of Argos, stared in admiration. But when\n",
      "75\n",
      "in his heart he’d admired and marveled at everything, then\n",
      "he made his way straight into the spacious cave; nor did she,\n",
      "Kalypsō, bright goddess, fail to know him when they met,\n",
      "for gods, being immortal, are not strangers to each other,\n",
      "even though one may dwell in a home that’s far away.\n",
      "80\n",
      "But great-hearted Odysseus he did not find within there,\n",
      "for he, as usual, was seated out on the seashore, weeping,\n",
      "rending his heart with tears and groans and sadness,\n",
      "gazing out through his tears at the unharvested sea.\n",
      "Kalypsō, bright among goddesses, now questioned Hermēs,\n",
      "85\n",
      "after settling him down on a brightly gleaming chair:\n",
      "“Why, golden-staffed Hermēs, honored and welcome, are you\n",
      "now visiting me? In the past you’ve seldom come here.\n",
      "Say what you want: my heart tells me to do it\n",
      "if do it I can, and it’s something that can be done.\n",
      "90\n",
      "But come with me now, let me offer you entertainment.”2\n",
      "So saying, the goddess placed before him a table on which\n",
      "she’d set out ambrosia, and mixed the red nectar for him.\n",
      "So he ate and drank, did the guide, the slayer of Argos;\n",
      "then, when he’d eaten and stayed his appetite with food,\n",
      "95\n",
      "in response to her question he addressed her as follows:\n",
      "“Why am I here, you ask me, as goddess to god: I’ll give you\n",
      "a full and truthful account, since that is your desire.\n",
      "Zeus it was told me to come here: I didn’t want to.\n",
      "Who would willingly traverse so much salt water,\n",
      "100\n",
      "an expanse past telling, with no city of mortals near it,\n",
      "men who honor the gods with lavish sacrifices?\n",
      "But no way can another god negate or circumvent\n",
      "what Zeus the aegis bearer has set his mind to!\n",
      "He says there’s a man here with you, one more ill-starred\n",
      "105\n",
      "than all other warriors who round about Priam’s city\n",
      "battled on for nine years; then in the tenth they sacked it\n",
      "and set off back home, but returning offended Athēnē,3\n",
      "who sent against them a foul storm and surging waves.\n",
      "Then all the rest of his noble companions perished,\n",
      "110\n",
      "but him the wind and waves bore off and carried hither,\n",
      "and him Zeus now bids you with all speed send on his way,\n",
      "since he’s not fated to die here, far from his dear ones,\n",
      "but it’s still his lot to see his friends and come home\n",
      "to his high-roofed house and his own dear native land.”\n",
      "115\n",
      "So he spoke; and Kalypsō, bright among goddesses, shivered,\n",
      "and responded to him with winged words, saying: “Hard-hearted\n",
      "are you gods indeed, and jealous beyond all others,\n",
      "who resent any goddesses sleeping with mortal men\n",
      "openly, if they choose one such as their bedfellow!\n",
      "120\n",
      "So it was when rose-fingered Dawn took up with Oriōn—\n",
      "you easy-living gods resented it, till at last\n",
      "in Ortygiē chaste Artemis, she of the golden throne,\n",
      "with her painless arrows assailed and killed him;4 so it was\n",
      "when fine-tressed Dēmētēr went with Iasiōn, gave in\n",
      "125\n",
      "to her passion, lay down and mingled with him\n",
      "in thrice-plowed fallow soil; not long was it before\n",
      "Zeus learned of it and with his bright bolt hit and slew him.\n",
      "So now too, gods, you resent my having a mortal companion.\n",
      "Him I saved when he was riding astride the keel,\n",
      "130\n",
      "alone, after Zeus with his bright bolt had struck\n",
      "and shattered his swift ship out on the wine-dark sea:\n",
      "Then all the rest of his noble companions perished,\n",
      "but him the wind and waves bore off and carried hither.\n",
      "To him I gave friendly welcome and comfort, telling him\n",
      "135\n",
      "I would make him immortal and ageless all his days. But since\n",
      "there’s no way for another god to negate or circumvent\n",
      "what Zeus the aegis bearer has set his mind to,\n",
      "let him go, if that’s what he has decided and so commands,\n",
      "across the unharvested sea! But no way shall I dispatch him,\n",
      "140\n",
      "for I have here no oared ships, nor the crews for them,\n",
      "to send him on his way across the broad back of the sea.\n",
      "Still, I’ll be glad to advise him, I’ll hold back nothing,\n",
      "to help him get back unharmed to his own country.”\n",
      "Then the guide, the slayer of Argos, responded to her, saying:\n",
      "145\n",
      "“So dispatch him now, and beware of the wrath of Zeus,\n",
      "lest he nurse resentment and rage against you later.”\n",
      "So saying, the mighty slayer of Argos now departed,\n",
      "and she, the queenly nymph, went to great-hearted\n",
      "Odysseus, after hearing the message Zeus had sent her.\n",
      "150\n",
      "Him she found on the seashore, sitting; nor were his eyes\n",
      "ever wiped dry of tears; sweet life was draining from him\n",
      "as he yearned to be home, since the nymph no longer pleased him.\n",
      "Nights indeed he would sleep beside her perforce\n",
      "in the hollow caverns, the reluctant by the eager,\n",
      "155\n",
      "but all day he’d stay seated there on the stony beach,\n",
      "rending his heart with tears and sighs and sorrows,\n",
      "and wept as he gazed out over the unharvested deep. Now she,\n",
      "bright among goddesses, stood close and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Ill-fated man, I beg you, weep here no longer, don’t let\n",
      "160\n",
      "your life go to waste: I’m now ready to send you on your way!\n",
      "Come, hew long timbers with the bronze, and shape them\n",
      "into a broad-beamed raft, fasten deck planks upon its\n",
      "topside, to carry you over the misty deep; and I\n",
      "will stow in it bread and water and bright red wine,\n",
      "165\n",
      "heart-strengthening stuff, to fend off hunger from you;\n",
      "and I’ll clothe you well, and send you a good tailwind,\n",
      "to let you get back unharmed to your own country—\n",
      "that’s if the gods wish it, they who hold the broad heavens,\n",
      "and are stronger than I am both to plan and accomplish.”\n",
      "170\n",
      "So she spoke, and noble much-enduring Odysseus shivered,\n",
      "and then responded to her with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“You’re planning some other thing, goddess, not my dispatch!\n",
      "On a raft you’re bidding me cross the sea’s great gulf,\n",
      "a fearful and perilous venture! Not even the best vessels,\n",
      "175\n",
      "trim and swift, always make it, even when given a tailwind\n",
      "by Zeus! I’ll not board any raft without your declared goodwill,\n",
      "unless you, goddess, agree to swear a mighty oath that this\n",
      "isn’t some bad new trick that you’re devising against me.”\n",
      "So he spoke; but Kalypsō bright among goddesses, smiled,\n",
      "180\n",
      "and stroked him with her hand, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“What a rogue you are, and by no means feeble-minded,\n",
      "that it occurred to you to address me in those terms!\n",
      "Very well: let earth bear witness, and the wide heaven above,\n",
      "and the cascade of Styx, the greatest and most dread\n",
      "185\n",
      "of all oaths observed and taken among the blessed gods,\n",
      "that this is no bad new trick that I’m plotting against you;\n",
      "no, my plans and considerations are such as I’d devise\n",
      "for my own personal use, should such a need come on me.\n",
      "My intentions are good, and the heart within my breast\n",
      "190\n",
      "is not made of iron, but compassionate.”\n",
      "With those words\n",
      "Kalypsō, bright among goddesses, went on ahead,\n",
      "at a brisk pace, and he followed in the goddess’ footsteps.\n",
      "They came to the hollow cavern, goddess and man together,\n",
      "and there he settled himself on the same chair from which\n",
      "195\n",
      "Hermēs had risen, while the nymph set all kinds of food\n",
      "before him to eat and drink, such stuff as mortals feed on,\n",
      "and she herself sat down facing godlike Odysseus,\n",
      "and her handmaids brought out for her ambrosia and nectar.\n",
      "So they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\n",
      "200\n",
      "But when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "Kalypsō, bright among goddesses, was the first to speak:\n",
      "“Son of Laërtēs, scion of Zeus, most resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "are you really so set on making your way back home\n",
      "to your own land at once? Yet I wish you well regardless!\n",
      "205\n",
      "If you only knew in your heart the full measure of trouble\n",
      "it’s your fate to incur before you reach your homeland,\n",
      "you’d rather stay here with me, and keep this house,\n",
      "and be immortal, despite your longing to see\n",
      "your wife, whom you pine for always, day in, day out!\n",
      "210\n",
      "I may indeed rightly claim not to be her inferior\n",
      "in either figure or stature, since no way is it seemly\n",
      "for mortal women to rival a goddess in form or beauty.”\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Don’t resent this, my lady goddess: I myself know well\n",
      "215\n",
      "that prudent Penelopē is in every way less striking\n",
      "in appearance than you, whether for stature or beauty,\n",
      "since she’s a mortal woman, whereas you’re immortal, ageless!\n",
      "Yet even so what I want and yearn for all my days\n",
      "Is to make it back home, to see the day of my returning!\n",
      "220\n",
      "Though some god may wreck me again on the wine-dark deep,\n",
      "I will endure: the heart in my breast can bear much trouble!\n",
      "Before now I’ve suffered much, have labored greatly\n",
      "amid waves and in warfare: to all that let this be added.”\n",
      "So he spoke: the sun went down, and darkness came on.\n",
      "225\n",
      "They repaired to the inmost recess of the hollow cavern\n",
      "and made love with pleasure, clasping each other close.\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "Odysseus promptly put on a tunic and cloak, while she,\n",
      "the nymph, also dressed herself in a long white robe,\n",
      "230\n",
      "fine-textured and beautiful, with an exquisite golden sash\n",
      "about her waist, and placed a veil on her head. She then\n",
      "began to plan the dispatch of great-hearted Odysseus. First\n",
      "she brought him a large axe, well fitted to his grasp,\n",
      "of bronze, sharp, double-bladed, with its splendid\n",
      "235\n",
      "handle of olive wood firmly attached. She also\n",
      "gave him a finely made adze. Then she led the way\n",
      "to the far end of the island, where there stood tall trees—\n",
      "alder and poplar, and fir that reached sky-high,\n",
      "dried out and seasoned, that would ride for him buoyantly.\n",
      "240\n",
      "But when she had shown him where the tall trees grew,\n",
      "Kalypsō, bright among goddesses, went back home, while he\n",
      "set himself to fell timber. The work progressed apace:\n",
      "twenty trees he felled, and trimmed them with the bronze,\n",
      "then skillfully smoothed them, made them true to the line.\n",
      "245\n",
      "Now Kalypsō, bright among goddesses, brought him augers:\n",
      "he bored through all the timbers, fitted them to each other,\n",
      "forced home and matched the joints, made them secure\n",
      "with tree nails. Just as wide as the curve of the hull\n",
      "that a skillful shipwright marks off for a broad-beamed freighter\n",
      "250\n",
      "was the width that Odysseus gave his raft. He fitted\n",
      "deck beams in, matched them firm to the close-set ribs,\n",
      "working away, and finished with lengthy gunwales.\n",
      "Next he set up a mast and attached a yardarm to it,\n",
      "and fashioned a steering oar with which to set his course.\n",
      "255\n",
      "Then he fenced the raft overall with osier wattles,\n",
      "against the waves, and added a bed of brushwood dunnage.\n",
      "Kalypsō meanwhile, bright among goddesses, brought him\n",
      "cloth to fashion a sail from: this too he did with skill,\n",
      "and added tackle—braces and sheets and halyards—\n",
      "260\n",
      "and used levers to shift the raft down to the bright salt deep.\n",
      "It was now the fourth day, and all his work was finished.\n",
      "On the fifth, bright Kalypsō saw him off from the island\n",
      "when she’d bathed him and dressed him in fresh-scented garments.\n",
      "On the raft the goddess put one skin of dark wine,\n",
      "265\n",
      "and another, a large one, of water, along with provisions\n",
      "in a leather bag—cooked meat in plenty to boost his strength—\n",
      "and raised a good following wind, warm and propitious.\n",
      "Happily then to the breeze did noble Odysseus spread\n",
      "his sail as he sat at the steering oar and skillfully\n",
      "270\n",
      "marked off his course;5 nor did sleep fall upon his eyelids\n",
      "as he steadily watched the Pleiades and late-setting Boōtēs\n",
      "and the Bear, which men also know as the Wagon, that circles\n",
      "in the place where it is, and keeps one eye on Orion,\n",
      "and alone never dips below the baths of Ocean.6\n",
      "275\n",
      "Kalypsō, bright among goddesses, had instructed him\n",
      "to keep this star on his left hand as he traversed the deep.\n",
      "For seventeen days he sailed on over the sea, and on\n",
      "the eighteenth there showed up the shadowy mountains\n",
      "of the Phaiakians’ land, where it came closest to him,\n",
      "280\n",
      "resembling a shield laid out on the misty sea.\n",
      "But the mighty Earth-Shaker, coming back from the Aithiopians,\n",
      "saw him far off,7 from the Solymoi’s mountains, visible\n",
      "sailing over the deep, and waxed wrathful at the sight,\n",
      "and shook his head, and thus communed with himself:\n",
      "285\n",
      "“Damn it, the gods have certainly changed their minds\n",
      "as regards Odysseus while I was away with the Aithiopians!\n",
      "Now he’s near the Phaiakians’ land, where it’s his destiny\n",
      "to escape the great crisis of suffering that’s come on him.\n",
      "Even so, I think I’ll yet give him his fill of trouble!”\n",
      "290\n",
      "So saying he gathered the clouds, and roiled up the deep,\n",
      "wielding his trident; he urged on to gale force every last\n",
      "wind in existence, he used the clouds to blot out\n",
      "both land and sea: nightfall dropped down from heaven,\n",
      "the east, south, and fierce west winds now drove together,\n",
      "295\n",
      "while the skyborne north wind rolled a huge wave before it,\n",
      "and Odysseus’ knees and heart gave way, and deeply\n",
      "shaken he now addressed his own great-hearted spirit:\n",
      "“Ah, wretch that I am, what’s my ultimate fate to be?\n",
      "All that the goddess told me, I fear, is true—\n",
      "300\n",
      "she said that out on the deep, before I reached my homeland\n",
      "I’d get my fill of trouble, and now it’s all happening!\n",
      "Look at the clouds with which Zeus is obscuring the wide\n",
      "heavens, the way he’s roiled up the sea, how the blasts\n",
      "of all the winds drive at me! Now my sheer destruction’s\n",
      "305\n",
      "for certain! Thrice and four times blessed those Danaäns\n",
      "who perished in Troy’s broad land, bringing aid to Atreus’ sons:\n",
      "How I wish I too had died then, had met my fate that day\n",
      "when a mass of Trojans pelted me with their bronze-tipped spears,\n",
      "battling around the dead son of Pēleus! Then\n",
      "310\n",
      "I’d have had proper burial, and from the Achaians renown:\n",
      "whereas now I’m doomed to suffer a most piteous death.”\n",
      "As he spoke, a huge wave bore down on him from above,\n",
      "with fearful force, and spun his raft clean around:\n",
      "far from the raft he fell, the steering oar was torn\n",
      "315\n",
      "from his grasp, the mast cracked in two, hit squarely\n",
      "by a gale-force gust from the winds in wild confusion,\n",
      "so that sail and yardarm fell far off into the deep.\n",
      "Him the sea long kept submerged, nor was he able\n",
      "to come up at once from the great wave’s onrush: the clothes\n",
      "320\n",
      "that bright Kalypsō had given him weighed him down.\n",
      "He finally reached the surface, spat out the briny\n",
      "sea water that streamed off his head; yet not even so,\n",
      "for all his exhaustion, did he lose sight of his raft,\n",
      "but pursued it amid the waves, somehow caught hold of it,\n",
      "325\n",
      "and clambered aboard and clung there, evading death’s end,\n",
      "while the great seas bore it onward, this way and that.\n",
      "As when in autumn the north wind blows thistledown\n",
      "over the plain, and the tufts cling close together,\n",
      "so hither and thither the winds now carried the raft\n",
      "330\n",
      "over the sea: now south wind would toss it to north\n",
      "to sweep onward, now east would yield it to west’s pursuit.\n",
      "But Kadmos’ daughter caught sight of him, neat-ankled Īnō,\n",
      "white goddess, who once was a mortal, and so spoke,\n",
      "but now in the sea’s depths had found honor from the gods.\n",
      "335\n",
      "She pitied Odysseus, so sea-tossed, so racked with troubles,\n",
      "made her way up like a shearwater from the depths, then perched\n",
      "on the strongly corded raft, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Poor man, why, pray, does Poseidōn the Earth-Shaker\n",
      "hate you so much8 that he afflicts you with all these troubles?\n",
      "340\n",
      "Yet despite his fury he shan’t completely destroy you!\n",
      "Now: do as I tell you: you seem not lacking in common sense.\n",
      "Strip off those clothes, leave your raft for the winds to play with,\n",
      "and yourself use your arms as a swimmer, strive to make it\n",
      "to the Phaiakians’ land, where your escape is destined!\n",
      "345\n",
      "And come, take this veil, bind it firmly about your body:\n",
      "It’s immortal, so have no fear that you’ll come to harm, or perish!\n",
      "But when your hands grasp the mainland, then untie it\n",
      "and fling it far out into the wine-dark deep,\n",
      "well away from the land, and yourself turn your back on it.”\n",
      "350\n",
      "So saying, the goddess handed over the veil,\n",
      "and herself plunged back down into the surging deep\n",
      "like a shearwater: the dark wave hid her. Then noble\n",
      "much-enduring Odysseus reflected, and, deeply shaken,\n",
      "now addressed his own great-hearted spirit, saying:\n",
      "355\n",
      "“Alas, I fear some immortal is once more weaving a snare\n",
      "against me, and that’s why she told me to leave the raft!\n",
      "I’ll not obey her yet: with my own eyes I saw, far distant,\n",
      "that land where she said I’d find my destined safety.\n",
      "This is what I shall do, and to me it seems my best course:\n",
      "360\n",
      "So long as the timbers hold firm, their joints unbroken,\n",
      "I shall stay put, and endure the troubles that I’m facing;\n",
      "But when the waves have shattered the raft to pieces\n",
      "then I’ll swim for it, since there’s no better plan.”\n",
      "While thus\n",
      "he pondered the matter in mind and heart, Poseidōn,\n",
      "365\n",
      "the Earth-Shaker, now conjured up a gigantic wave—\n",
      "fearsome and grim, overarching—and launched it at him.\n",
      "As when a gusting wind whisks up a heap of dried-out\n",
      "husks, and scatters some here, some there, just so\n",
      "the wave strewed the raft’s long timbers; and now Odysseus\n",
      "370\n",
      "sat astride one beam, like someone riding a horse,\n",
      "stripped off the garments that bright Kalypsō gave him,\n",
      "quickly tied round his body the veil, and flung himself\n",
      "headfirst into the sea, both arms outstretched, prepared\n",
      "to swim for his life. The mighty Earth-Shaker saw him,\n",
      "375\n",
      "and shook his head, and thus communed with his heart:\n",
      "“So, after all your troubles, go drifting over the deep\n",
      "until you meet with those men who are Zeus’ nurslings!\n",
      "Yet even so I don’t think you’ll underrate your hardships.”\n",
      "So saying, he whipped up his beautifully maned horses\n",
      "380\n",
      "and went on to Aigai, where he has his famed abode.\n",
      "But Zeus’ daughter Athēnē had a different notion:\n",
      "the other winds she now stopped short in their tracks,\n",
      "made them all die down and be lulled to sleep, but the swift\n",
      "north wind she aroused, parting the waves before it,\n",
      "385\n",
      "to let Zeus’ scion Odysseus get through to the oar-loving\n",
      "Phaiakians, after escaping death and death’s harbingers.\n",
      "Two nights and two days now over the heaving swell\n",
      "he pressed on: many times his heart saw destruction ahead.\n",
      "But when fair-haired Dawn brought the third morning on,\n",
      "390\n",
      "then the wind dropped, and there followed a windless calm,\n",
      "and he sighted land close ahead of him, as he took\n",
      "a quick glance forward, lifted up by a swelling wave.\n",
      "As most welcome appear to his children renewed signs of life\n",
      "in a father who’s laid on a sickbed, suffering agonies,\n",
      "395\n",
      "long wasting away, attacked by some hateful spirit,\n",
      "but then, oh joy, the gods free him from his illness—\n",
      "so welcome seemed to Odysseus the land and its forest,\n",
      "and he swam on, longing to set foot on solid earth.\n",
      "But when as close to land as a man’s shout carries,\n",
      "400\n",
      "hearing the crash of the breakers against the reefs—\n",
      "for the huge wave thundered as it smashed into dry land,\n",
      "roaring terribly: all around was misted in salt sea spray,\n",
      "and there were no harbors to dock ships, no roadsteads either,\n",
      "nothing but jutting headlands, and reefs and rocks—\n",
      "405\n",
      "then the knees and heart of Odysseus gave way together,\n",
      "and deeply shaken he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:\n",
      "“Oh no, now Zeus has granted me an unlooked-for\n",
      "glimpse of dry land, and I’ve plowed my way through this gulf,\n",
      "no way of escape can I see from the grey brine, for offshore\n",
      "410\n",
      "are sharp rocks, and all around them the waves surge up\n",
      "roaring, the cliff-face towers sheer above them; the seawater\n",
      "runs deep close in to land, so there’s no way to stand firm\n",
      "on both feet and escape destruction: I fear as I’m coming ashore\n",
      "some huge wave may scoop me up and dash me against\n",
      "415\n",
      "a sharp rough rock, putting paid to all my efforts.\n",
      "But if I swim further along, to see if I maybe can find\n",
      "bays where the waves strike aslant, or safe harbors from the sea,\n",
      "I’m afraid that the storm winds may snatch me up once more,\n",
      "and bear me back, groaning heavily, over the fish-rich deep,\n",
      "420\n",
      "or a marine divinity may send some huge monster against me\n",
      "out of the sea, one of many that famed Amphitrītē breeds—\n",
      "for I know how deeply the famed Earth-Shaker hates me.”9\n",
      "While he brooded upon these matters in mind and spirit\n",
      "a great wave flung him forward against the rocky shoreline.\n",
      "425\n",
      "There would his bones have been crushed and his skin ripped off\n",
      "had not grey-eyed Athēnē, the goddess, put a thought in his mind:\n",
      "with both hands, plunging forward, he seized the rock,\n",
      "and clung to it, gasping, while the great wave rushed by.\n",
      "Thus this one he dodged, but its backwash caught and struck him\n",
      "430\n",
      "and carried him off, flung him far out to sea.\n",
      "Just as an octopus, when dragged up out of its lair,\n",
      "will have clusters of pebbles sticking fast to its suckers,\n",
      "so from his powerful hands against the rock were scraps\n",
      "of skin stripped off as the great wave went over him.\n",
      "435\n",
      "Beyond his fate, then, surely would wretched Odysseus\n",
      "have died, had not grey-eyed Athēnē sharpened his wits.\n",
      "Coming up out of the surge as it discharged on the shore\n",
      "he swam outside, eyeing the land, to see if he could find\n",
      "bays where the waves struck aslant, or safe harbors from the sea.\n",
      "440\n",
      "But when, as he swam, he came on the mouth of a flowing\n",
      "river, this struck him as the best possible place,\n",
      "being free of stones, and well sheltered from the wind.\n",
      "He recognized the live current, and made a silent prayer:\n",
      "“Hear me, lord, whoever you are, and to me most welcome:\n",
      "445\n",
      "from the deep I come to you, fleeing Poseidōn’s threats—\n",
      "Sacrosanct, even to the immortal gods, is that man\n",
      "who comes as a wanderer, as I come now to your\n",
      "current, and to your knees, after many hardships:\n",
      "So pity me, lord: your suppliant I hereby declare myself.”\n",
      "450\n",
      "Thus he spoke; at once the god stopped flowing, checked the waves,\n",
      "created a calm before him, brought him safe and sound\n",
      "to the river’s mouth. Both knees now lost their strength\n",
      "and his strong hands too: the salt deep had crushed his spirit,\n",
      "all his flesh was swollen, seawater oozed in streams\n",
      "455\n",
      "out through his mouth and nostrils. Breathless, speechless\n",
      "he lay, barely stirring: dire exhaustion had overcome him.\n",
      "When he got his breath back, and the heart revived in his breast,\n",
      "he then unwound the goddess’ veil from his body\n",
      "and dropped it into the seaward-flowing river. A great\n",
      "460\n",
      "wave now carried it back downstream, and Īnō quickly\n",
      "gathered it into her hands. Odysseus turned from the river,\n",
      "collapsed in the reeds, and kissed the grain-giving earth.\n",
      "Deeply shaken he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:\n",
      "“Ah, what must I suffer? What’s my ultimate fate to be?\n",
      "465\n",
      "If I keep watch here by the river all the irksome night\n",
      "I’m afraid the hard frost and the chilly dew between them,\n",
      "because of my weakness, may quell my gasping spirit—\n",
      "and the breeze off the river blows cold before the dawn.\n",
      "But if I climb the slope to the shadowy forest\n",
      "470\n",
      "and lie down among the dense thickets, then even if cold\n",
      "and exhaustion don’t touch me, and I enjoy sweet sleep,\n",
      "I fear I may end as the spoil and prey of wild beasts.”\n",
      "As he reflected, it struck him this last was the best course.\n",
      "He set off into the maquis and found what he wanted near\n",
      "475\n",
      "the water, beside a clearing. He crept in under two bushes,\n",
      "evergreen thorn and wild olive, that grew from the same spot.\n",
      "Through these the damp winds’ violence could never blow,\n",
      "nor the rays of the bright sun penetrate, nor storms\n",
      "of rain pierce their defenses, so densely they grew,\n",
      "480\n",
      "interlaced the one with the other. In under these\n",
      "Odysseus crept, and with his hands briskly swept\n",
      "a wide bed of leaves together. Dried fallen leaves were there\n",
      "in abundance, enough to give shelter to two or three men\n",
      "in the winter season, however severe the weather.\n",
      "485\n",
      "Seeing this, much-enduring noble Odysseus rejoiced:\n",
      "he lay down in the middle, heaped fallen leaves over him.\n",
      "As a man hides a smoldering log under dark embers\n",
      "far out in the countryside, a man who has no neighbors,\n",
      "to save a seed of fire, and not need to rekindle it,\n",
      "490\n",
      "so Odysseus piled leaves over himself, and Athēnē\n",
      "shed sleep on his eyes, to free him as soon as might be\n",
      "from toilsome exhaustion, wrap his eyelids in darkness.\n",
      "Book 6\n",
      "So Odysseus slept on there, godlike and much-enduring,\n",
      "worn out by exhaustion and hardship; and meanwhile Athēnē\n",
      "went off to the district and city of the Phaiakians, who\n",
      "at one time made their home in spacious Hypereia,\n",
      "and were neighbors to the Kyklōpes, rough arrogant men,\n",
      "5\n",
      "who kept raiding them, and were more powerful. Godlike\n",
      "Nausithoös then uprooted them, led them to Scheria,\n",
      "remote from bread-eating mortals, settled them there.\n",
      "He ran a wall round the city, constructed houses,\n",
      "made shrines for the gods, shared out the arable acres.\n",
      "10\n",
      "But by now he’d succumbed to his fate, gone down to Hades,\n",
      "and Alkinoös was the ruler, who had wisdom from the gods.\n",
      "To his dwelling now went the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē,\n",
      "with her plan for great-hearted Odysseus’ return home.\n",
      "She entered the ornate bedroom in which there slept a girl\n",
      "15\n",
      "most like the immortals in form and appearance: Nausikaä,\n",
      "daughter of great-hearted Alkinoös, with close by her\n",
      "two handmaids, made beautiful by the Graces, one on each\n",
      "side of the doorposts; and the bright doors were shut.\n",
      "Like a breath of wind she now swept in to the girl’s bedside,\n",
      "20\n",
      "and stood above her head, and addressed her, assuming\n",
      "the form of the daughter of Dymas, famous for his ships—\n",
      "a girl Nausikaä’s age, and very dear to her heart.\n",
      "In her likeness grey-eyed Athēnē spoke to her, saying:\n",
      "“Nausikaä, how could your mother have so careless a child?\n",
      "25\n",
      "Your bright smart clothes are all lying about uncared-for,\n",
      "yet your marriage is near, when you’ll need fine clothes for yourself,\n",
      "and garments, too, to provide for those who’ll escort you.\n",
      "This is the kind of thing that gets you well spoken of\n",
      "among men, and pleases your father and lady mother!\n",
      "30\n",
      "So let’s go and do the washing tomorrow at daybreak:\n",
      "I’ll come with you as helper, let you make yourself ready\n",
      "as soon as may be: you won’t be unmarried much longer!\n",
      "Already suitors are courting you, the noblest Phaiakians\n",
      "in these parts—and you share their lineage! So come now,\n",
      "35\n",
      "urge your far-famed father, first thing this morning,\n",
      "to have mules and a wagon ready, to carry for you\n",
      "the sashes and robes and bright coverlets. And for yourself\n",
      "it’s much better to travel this way than to go by foot:\n",
      "the washing troughs are a long way distant from the city.”\n",
      "40\n",
      "That said, the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, departed\n",
      "for Olympos, where, they say, the gods have their abode\n",
      "forever immovable, never shaken by gales nor wet\n",
      "with rain, nor does snow ever visit them; the sky\n",
      "stretches dazzling and cloudless, the upper air gleams white.\n",
      "45\n",
      "The blessed gods find enjoyment here all their days,\n",
      "and here the grey-eyed one went, after speaking with the girl.\n",
      "Now Dawn on her fine throne arrived, and woke up the latter,\n",
      "the finely robed Nausikaä. She at once, amazed by her dream,\n",
      "went off through the house to report it to her parents,\n",
      "50\n",
      "her own dear father and mother. She found them in:\n",
      "her mother sitting there at the hearth with her handmaids,\n",
      "spinning sea-purple yarn on a distaff; her father she caught\n",
      "on the point of leaving to join the distinguished elders\n",
      "in council, summoned there by the lords of Phaiakia.\n",
      "55\n",
      "She went up to her dear father, and addressed him thus:\n",
      "“Dear Papa, won’t you please have a wagon made ready for me—\n",
      "the high one, with good wheels, so I can take the fine\n",
      "clothes that are lying here soiled to the river for washing?\n",
      "For you too it’s proper, when you’re with the chief men\n",
      "60\n",
      "debating in council, to be wearing fresh-laundered clothes,\n",
      "and you’ve five sons living with you, here in your halls,\n",
      "two married, but three lively bachelors, who always\n",
      "insist on having fresh-laundered clothes to put on\n",
      "for going to the dance: all this now needs my attention.”\n",
      "65\n",
      "So she spoke, too embarrassed to mention lusty marriage\n",
      "to her father; but he understood all, and responded, saying:\n",
      "“I begrudge you neither the mules, child, nor anything else,\n",
      "so off you go: the servants will ready the wagon for you—\n",
      "the high one, with good wheels, and fitted bodywork.”\n",
      "70\n",
      "With that he called to the servants, and they obeyed him.\n",
      "They made ready the good-wheeled mule wagon outside,\n",
      "and brought the mules, and yoked and harnessed them,\n",
      "while the girl fetched out the bright garments from indoors,\n",
      "and stowed them away in the polished cart, and her mother\n",
      "75\n",
      "added a box full of satisfying things to eat—\n",
      "appetizers galore, and poured out a measure of wine\n",
      "in a goatskin bottle. Nausikaä boarded the wagon,\n",
      "and her mother gave her a golden flask full of soft oil, with which\n",
      "she and her handmaids could massage themselves.1 She now\n",
      "80\n",
      "took hold of the whip and the brightly polished reins,\n",
      "and whipped up the mules to start them. They clattered off\n",
      "at a smart trot, not pausing, with girl and laundry aboard—\n",
      "not alone, for her handmaids all came along with her.\n",
      "When they reached the sweet flow of the river, at the site\n",
      "85\n",
      "of the regular wash troughs—always enough clean water\n",
      "from springs there or outflow to clean the dirtiest garments—\n",
      "then they unhitched the mules, set them free from the wagon,\n",
      "and shooed them off along the bank of the eddying river\n",
      "to graze on honey-sweet clover, while they themselves\n",
      "90\n",
      "took armfuls of clothes from the wagon to the dark water\n",
      "and trod them out in the basins, fast-moving, competitive.\n",
      "Then after they’d washed them and got them clean again\n",
      "they spread them in rows on the shoreline, where the surf\n",
      "beating upon the strand had most clearly scoured the pebbles.\n",
      "95\n",
      "Then they bathed, and rubbed themselves down with oil,\n",
      "and ate their lunch beside the banks of the river\n",
      "while waiting until the clothes dried off in the bright sunlight.\n",
      "When the handmaids and Nausikaä had eaten their fill\n",
      "they then threw off their veils and turned to playing ball,\n",
      "100\n",
      "and white-armed Nausikaä was their leader as they sang.\n",
      "Just as the archer Artemis roams across mountain ranges—\n",
      "lofty Taÿgetos, say, or Erymanthos—exulting\n",
      "in her pursuit of wild boar or of the swift-footed deer,\n",
      "and country nymphs, daughters of Zeus the aegis bearer,\n",
      "105\n",
      "join the sport with her, and Lētō rejoices at the sight\n",
      "of Artemis, head and brow higher than all the others,\n",
      "and easily recognized, though each one is beautiful:\n",
      "so amid all her handmaids shone out this unwed maiden.\n",
      "But when she was on the point of starting back homeward,\n",
      "110\n",
      "with the mules yoked up and the fine clothes folded, then\n",
      "the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, had another idea:\n",
      "that Odysseus should wake, and see the sweet-faced girl,\n",
      "and that she should escort him to the Phaiakians’ city.\n",
      "So when the princess next tossed the ball to a handmaid\n",
      "115\n",
      "she missed the handmaid, and sent it into a deep eddy.\n",
      "They all cried out at length, and noble Odysseus awoke,\n",
      "and sat up, wondering in his mind and heart: “Ah me,\n",
      "among what sort of mortals have I now made landfall?\n",
      "Are they wild and outrageous, men with no sense of justice,\n",
      "120\n",
      "or hospitable to strangers, a god-fearing people? An outcry\n",
      "of women—young girls—just echoed round about me:\n",
      "the nymphs, it could be, who haunt the sheer mountain peaks\n",
      "and the rivers’ springs and the grassy meadows! Or am I\n",
      "somewhere near talking humans? Well, come on now,\n",
      "125\n",
      "let me take a look for myself, see what I can discover.”\n",
      "That said, godlike Odysseus came out from under the bushes.\n",
      "Strong-handed, he broke off a leafy branch from the dense\n",
      "maquis to cover his body, hide the male parts. He came forth\n",
      "like some mountain-bred lion, confident in his strength,\n",
      "130\n",
      "who, beaten by wind and rain, still advances, both his eyes\n",
      "ablaze, as in among cattle or sheep he hastens, or in\n",
      "pursuit of wild deer: his ravenous belly drives him\n",
      "to go after the flocks even inside the close-walled farmstead.\n",
      "So Odysseus was set to mingle,2 though naked, among these\n",
      "135\n",
      "fair-tressed young girls: such need had come upon him.\n",
      "A terrifying sight they found him, all crusted with dried brine,\n",
      "and they scattered in panic around the jutting sand-spits.\n",
      "Alkinoös’ daughter alone stood firm, for Athēnē had put\n",
      "courage into her heart, and purged the fear from her limbs.\n",
      "140\n",
      "She stood still, holding her ground. Odysseus debated—should he\n",
      "clasp the knees of this good-looking girl when making his plea,\n",
      "or should he stay put, just cajole her with honey-sweet phrases\n",
      "so she’d give him clothes, show him the way into town?\n",
      "As he thus reflected, he decided that it would be better\n",
      "145\n",
      "to stay put, just cajole her with honey-sweet phrases—\n",
      "the girl might take offense if he grabbed her knees!\n",
      "So he made an impromptu speech, both honey-sweet and crafty:\n",
      "“By your knees I entreat you, lady—some goddess are you,\n",
      "or mortal? If a goddess, one of those who hold broad heaven,\n",
      "150\n",
      "then to Artemis, great Zeus’ daughter, I find you most\n",
      "nearly akin in beauty and height and carriage; but if\n",
      "you’re mortal, one of those who dwell here on earth, then thrice\n",
      "blessed indeed are your father and the lady your mother,\n",
      "thrice blessed your brothers! Greatly warmed with pleasure\n",
      "155\n",
      "must their hearts always be on your account, as they see\n",
      "so fine an offshoot taking her place among the dancers!\n",
      "But blessed at heart, far above all others, is he\n",
      "who’ll dower you with bride-gifts and lead you to his home!\n",
      "Never before have my eyes seen a mortal such as you are,\n",
      "160\n",
      "either man or woman: I’m awed at the sight of you!\n",
      "On Dēlos once, beside Apollo’s altar, I saw\n",
      "something like you: a young palm-shoot springing up—\n",
      "I put in there, along with a crowd of followers,\n",
      "on the same journey fated to bring me such misfortune—\n",
      "165\n",
      "and likewise at that sight I was long in awe,\n",
      "since never before had such a tree sprung from earth!\n",
      "Just so, lady, I’m awed and amazed by you, and greatly\n",
      "fear now to touch your knees. Much hardship has assailed me:\n",
      "for twenty days—until yesterday, when I got clear\n",
      "170\n",
      "of the wine-dark sea—the waves and storm winds bore me\n",
      "away from the isle of Ōgygia. Now some god’s landed me here,\n",
      "I guess, to suffer more trouble, for I don’t suppose\n",
      "it’ll stop now: the gods have plenty in store for me still.\n",
      "So, lady, show me compassion: after all my suffering\n",
      "175\n",
      "you’re the first person I’ve met—not a single other one\n",
      "do I know of all those who possess this city and this country.\n",
      "Just show me the way into town, give me some rag to wear—\n",
      "maybe you had a wrapper for the clothes you brought here?—\n",
      "and may the gods grant you all that your heart desires,\n",
      "180\n",
      "husband, home, and like-mindedness—a precious gift,\n",
      "for there’s nothing greater or better, ever, than when two\n",
      "like-minded people are keeping house together,\n",
      "a man and his wife: much frustration for their ill-wishers,\n",
      "much joy for their friends, but they two know it the best.”\n",
      "185\n",
      "Then white-armed Nausikaä made him this answer: “Stranger,\n",
      "you seem neither malicious nor witless: but it’s Zeus,\n",
      "the Olympian in person, who bestows good fortune on men,\n",
      "the good and the bad, to each as he wills; I suppose\n",
      "he chose this lot for you, and you just have to bear it.\n",
      "190\n",
      "But now, since it’s our land and city that you’ve come to,\n",
      "you’ll not go short of clothing nor of anything else\n",
      "that befits a long-suffering suppliant on arrival.\n",
      "I’ll show you the way into town, name the inhabitants:\n",
      "it’s the Phaiakians who possess this land and city,\n",
      "195\n",
      "and I am the daughter of great-hearted Alkinoös,\n",
      "in whom the Phaiakians’ power and might are vested.”\n",
      "That said, she snapped out orders to her fair-tressed handmaids:\n",
      "“Come back here, girls! Scuttling off when you see a man?\n",
      "Do you really suppose he’s some kind of enemy?\n",
      "200\n",
      "There’s no mortal alive, nor could there ever be one,\n",
      "who’d show up in this land of Phaiakian men\n",
      "with hostile intent, so dear are we to the immortals!\n",
      "Remote is our dwelling, far off in the surging deep;\n",
      "none further distant, other mortals don’t mix with us.\n",
      "205\n",
      "No, this is some ill-starred drifter who’s ended up here,\n",
      "and we must now take care of, since from Zeus are all\n",
      "strangers and beggars: any gift, though small, is welcome.\n",
      "So come, girls, provide this stranger with food and drink,\n",
      "and wash him off in the river, well sheltered from the wind.”\n",
      "210\n",
      "So she spoke. They stopped, and encouraged one another,\n",
      "and brought Odysseus to shelter, just as Nausikaä,\n",
      "daughter of great-hearted Alkinoös, had told them to do,\n",
      "and put beside him a mantle and tunic to wear, and gave him\n",
      "the golden flask containing soft liquid olive oil,\n",
      "215\n",
      "and offered to wash him off in the flow of the river.\n",
      "Then godlike Odysseus addressed the handmaids, saying:\n",
      "“Handmaids, stand further off, leave me on my own\n",
      "to scrub off the brine from my shoulders, rub myself over\n",
      "with oil—indeed it’s a long time since oil came near my skin.\n",
      "220\n",
      "I’m not going to bathe in your presence: I feel embarrassed\n",
      "to be naked among all you fair-tressed young ladies.”\n",
      "So he spoke. They went back, told Nausikaä what he’d said.\n",
      "Now godlike Odysseus scrubbed off with river water\n",
      "the brine encrusting his back and his broad shoulders,\n",
      "225\n",
      "and wiped the unharvested sea’s scurf from his head;\n",
      "then when he’d washed all over, and rubbed himself with oil,\n",
      "and had put on the clothes that the unwed girl provided,\n",
      "then Athēnē, offspring of Zeus, made him in appearance\n",
      "taller and stronger, made the hair spring from his head\n",
      "230\n",
      "in rich curls, like the flower of the hyacinth. As when a man\n",
      "overlays silver with gold, a skillful artisan who’s been\n",
      "taught every craft by Hephaistos and Pallas Athēnē,\n",
      "and thus turns out the most elegant handiwork,\n",
      "such was the grace she shed upon his head and shoulders.\n",
      "235\n",
      "Then he took himself off, sat down on the seashore\n",
      "agleam with beauty and grace: the girl stared, awestruck,\n",
      "and addressed her fair-tressed handmaids, saying: “Listen,\n",
      "my white-armed handmaids: let me tell you something!\n",
      "Not without the gods’ will—all the gods who hold Olympos—\n",
      "240\n",
      "has this man come here to mingle with the godlike Phaiakians!\n",
      "Before, he seemed to me to be mean and shabby,\n",
      "whereas now he resembles the gods who possess broad heaven!\n",
      "If only a man such as this could be chosen as my husband—\n",
      "could be domiciled here—might even want to stay here!\n",
      "245\n",
      "But come, girls, provide the stranger with food and drink.”\n",
      "So she spoke, and they readily heard and obeyed her,\n",
      "and set before Odysseus both food and drink. So now\n",
      "the much-enduring godlike Odysseus both ate and drank,\n",
      "ravenously, since he’d gone a long time without food.\n",
      "250\n",
      "Now white-armed Nausikaä had one more thought. She folded\n",
      "the clothes, and stowed them in the beautiful wagon,\n",
      "and yoked the hard-hoofed mules, and climbed aboard herself.\n",
      "Then she called out to Odysseus, addressed him directly:\n",
      "“Get up now, stranger, and I’ll guide you to town, direct you\n",
      "255\n",
      "to my wise father’s house, where, I promise you, you’ll make\n",
      "the acquaintance of all the best of the Phaiakians.\n",
      "But be sure to do as I say—and you don’t strike me as witless.\n",
      "As long as we’re out in the countryside, fields and farmland,\n",
      "come briskly along with my girls behind the mules\n",
      "260\n",
      "and wagon; I’ll lead the way. But when we’re about\n",
      "to enter the city3—there’s a high wall round it, a fine\n",
      "harbor on either side of the city, with a narrow entrance,\n",
      "and trim vessels are moored all along the way, each one\n",
      "with a slip of its own, private docking for everyone;\n",
      "265\n",
      "there too is the place of assembly, by Poseidōn’s fine precinct,\n",
      "marked out with great deep-bedded quarried stones,\n",
      "and it’s there that they busy themselves with the black ships’ tackle,\n",
      "their cables and sails, and there that they trim their oar blades;\n",
      "for bows and quivers are not the Phaiakians’ concern,\n",
      "270\n",
      "but ships’ masts, oars, and the trim vessels themselves,\n",
      "in which with delight they traverse the sea’s grey waters.\n",
      "It’s their rude comments I want to avoid, the chance that later\n",
      "some man may blame me—there are unkind folk among us—\n",
      "and one of the nastier sort might say if he met us:\n",
      "275\n",
      "‘Who’s this tall handsome stranger tagging after Nausikaä?\n",
      "Where did she pick him up? Her husband-to-be, no doubt!\n",
      "Some stray off a ship she’ll be bringing in, I suppose,\n",
      "from a foreign crew—there aren’t any from hereabouts—\n",
      "unless some god’s come down from heaven in answer\n",
      "280\n",
      "to her endless prayers, and she’ll keep him around for life!\n",
      "Better, if she herself went off and found a husband\n",
      "elsewhere, since she despises these men here in the district,\n",
      "though many top-class Phaiakians are courting her.’ So they’ll say,\n",
      "and such remarks would attach a scandal to my name.\n",
      "285\n",
      "I too would disapprove if another girl behaved thus—\n",
      "one that in defiance of her dear father and mother\n",
      "consorted with men before reaching the day of public marriage.\n",
      "So, stranger, quickly grasp what I’m telling you, to ensure\n",
      "prompt assistance from my father in getting you back home.\n",
      "290\n",
      "You’ll find a fine grove of Athēnē near the road, a grove\n",
      "of poplars; a spring gushes up in it, there’s a meadow round it.\n",
      "That’s where my father’s estate is, his flourishing orchard—\n",
      "as far from town as the shout of a man will carry.\n",
      "Sit down there and wait a while, long enough for us\n",
      "295\n",
      "to get to the city, arrive at my father’s house. But when\n",
      "you reckon we’ve made it home, then yourself go on\n",
      "to the city of the Phaiakians, and ask around\n",
      "where you can find the house of great-hearted Alkinoös.\n",
      "It’s easily recognized—even a child could guide you,\n",
      "300\n",
      "the merest infant, since the other Phaiakians’ houses\n",
      "aren’t built on a scale to match the abode of heroic\n",
      "Alkinoös! Then, when you reach that the house and courtyard,\n",
      "go quickly through the main hall, until you come upon\n",
      "my mother—you’ll find her sitting in firelight by the hearth,\n",
      "305\n",
      "spinning sea-purple yarn on a distaff, a wonderful sight,\n",
      "leaning against a pillar, her maids seated behind her;\n",
      "and there is my father’s throne, set close by her side,\n",
      "where he sits and drinks his wine like an immortal.\n",
      "Go on past him, throw your arms round the knees\n",
      "310\n",
      "of my mother, if you’re to get a quick and happy glimpse\n",
      "of your day of homecoming, no matter how far you’ve come:\n",
      "it’s if she looks on you with favor in her heart\n",
      "that there’s hope for you of seeing your people, of getting\n",
      "back to your own strong house and your native country.”\n",
      "315\n",
      "So saying, she lashed out with her shining whip at the mules,\n",
      "and they quickly took off, away from the flowing river:\n",
      "they trotted well, well did they ply their feet, and she drove\n",
      "taking good care that Odysseus and her handmaids\n",
      "could keep up on foot, used her whip very sparingly.\n",
      "320\n",
      "As the sun set they reached the famous grove, sacred\n",
      "to Athēnē. Here godlike Odysseus sat himself down,\n",
      "and at once made his prayer to great Zeus’ daughter: “Hear me,\n",
      "unwearying child of Zeus of the aegis! Listen now,\n",
      "as you failed to listen before when I was stricken,\n",
      "325\n",
      "when the far-famed Earth-Shaker struck me! Grant that now\n",
      "when I come among the Phaiakians I’m befriended and pitied.”\n",
      "So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athēnē heard him,\n",
      "but did not yet show herself to him, for she respected\n",
      "her father’s brother, who continued to rage against\n",
      "330\n",
      "godlike Odysseus until he got back to his own country.\n",
      "Book 7\n",
      "So while Odysseus prayed there, godlike and much-enduring,\n",
      "the strength of her two mules bore the girl back to town.\n",
      "When she arrived at her father’s renowned abode\n",
      "she pulled up in the forecourt. Her brothers, men like immortals,\n",
      "came out, crowded round her, unyoked the mules\n",
      "5\n",
      "from the wagon, carried the laundry indoors, while she\n",
      "herself went to her room. There a fire was lit for her by\n",
      "an old crone from Apeirē, her chambermaid, Eurymedousa.\n",
      "Long ago the trim ships had brought her back from Apeirē,\n",
      "and they’d chosen her as a prize for Alkinoös, since he ruled\n",
      "10\n",
      "over all the Phaiakians: the people obeyed him like a god.\n",
      "She’d reared white-armed Nausikaä in his halls; now it was she\n",
      "who lit her a fire and made ready her supper in her room.\n",
      "Then Odysseus got up to go to the city, and Athēnē,\n",
      "wishing him well, shed a thick mist round about him,\n",
      "15\n",
      "so that no great-hearted Phaiakian whom he encountered\n",
      "should address him in uncivil terms, ask who he might be;\n",
      "then, when he was about to enter the pleasant city,\n",
      "the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, met him, in the guise\n",
      "of a young virginal girl with a pitcher. She stopped before him,\n",
      "20\n",
      "and godlike Odysseus questioned her, saying: “My child,\n",
      "could you not guide me to the house of a man by name\n",
      "Alkinoös, who’s the ruler among the people here?\n",
      "I’m a long-suffering stranger, come from a remote\n",
      "and far-off country, so I possess no knowledge\n",
      "25\n",
      "of the people who occupy this city and its land.”\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, answered him, saying:\n",
      "“Yes, stranger, father, I can show you the house you want,\n",
      "for this man’s the neighbor of my own illustrious father!\n",
      "Just keep silent and follow where I lead the way—\n",
      "30\n",
      "Don’t catch anyone’s eye, or ask them questions,\n",
      "for the folk hereabouts have little patience with strangers,\n",
      "and are short on welcome for those from another country.\n",
      "They rely on the swiftness of the racing vessels in which\n",
      "they traverse the sea’s great gulf, a gift from the Earth-Shaker:\n",
      "35\n",
      "their ships contrive all the speed of a wing or a thought.”\n",
      "Having said this, Pallas Athēnē then led the way\n",
      "briskly, and he followed in the goddess’ footsteps.\n",
      "Nor did the Phaiakians, famed for their ships, observe him\n",
      "going through the city among them; fair-tressed Athēnē,\n",
      "40\n",
      "dread goddess, did not allow it: she shed a marvelous\n",
      "mist over him, out of the kindness she bore him in her heart.\n",
      "Odysseus gazed in wonder at the trim ships and the harbors,\n",
      "the heroes’ assembly places, the city walls long and high\n",
      "and fitted with palisades, a marvelous sight to behold.\n",
      "45\n",
      "When they arrived at the king’s magnificent dwelling\n",
      "the first to speak was the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē:\n",
      "“Here is the house, stranger, father, that you asked me to show you!\n",
      "You’ll find Zeus’ nurslings, the princes, right inside there\n",
      "eating their dinner. Go in, and don’t let your heart\n",
      "50\n",
      "show alarm: a man whose every move speaks boldness\n",
      "does better, even supposing he comes from some other country.\n",
      "The first person you’ll met in the great hall is its mistress:\n",
      "Arētē’s the name by which she’s known, and she comes\n",
      "of the very same stock that bred Alkinoös, the king.\n",
      "55\n",
      "Nausithoös first Poseidōn, the Earth-Shaker,\n",
      "sired on Periboia, a woman of matchless beauty,\n",
      "the youngest daughter of great-hearted Eurymedōn,\n",
      "who once ruled as king over the arrogant Giants,\n",
      "but destroyed his reckless people and was destroyed himself.\n",
      "60\n",
      "With her Poseidōn lay in love and begot a son,\n",
      "great-hearted Nausithoös, who ruled the Phaiakians,\n",
      "and Nausithoös sired Alkinoös and Rhēxēnōr.\n",
      "Apollo, the silver-bowed, struck Rhēxēnōr down\n",
      "while a sonless bridegroom, who left one daughter only,\n",
      "65\n",
      "Arētē: her Alkinoös took as his wife, and honored\n",
      "as no other woman upon this earth is honored\n",
      "of all those who run their households subject to men,\n",
      "so honored at heart is she, and ever has been,\n",
      "by her dear children and by Alkinoös himself,\n",
      "70\n",
      "and by the people, who look upon her as a goddess\n",
      "and so greet her when she goes abroad through the city;\n",
      "for she herself is in no way lacking in judgment\n",
      "and settles disputes with goodwill, even those between men.\n",
      "So if she’s well disposed toward you, then there’s a chance\n",
      "75\n",
      "that you’ll get to see your own people, make it back home\n",
      "to your high-roofed house and your own native land.”\n",
      "So saying, grey-eyed Athēnē now departed, over\n",
      "the unharvested sea, took off from delightful Scheria\n",
      "and came to Marathōn and wide-streeted Athens,\n",
      "80\n",
      "and entered the close-set house of Erechtheus. But Odysseus\n",
      "went to Alkinoös’ splendid abode. Much his heart pondered\n",
      "as he stood there, even before he reached its brazen threshold,\n",
      "for there was a radiance as of the sun or the moon\n",
      "over the high-roofed home of great-hearted Alkinoös.\n",
      "85\n",
      "Bronze walls stretched this way and that to the inmost\n",
      "room from the threshold, framed by a cobalt frieze;\n",
      "golden doors safeguarded the close-built inner domain,\n",
      "with silver doorposts set in a threshold of bronze,\n",
      "and silver the lintel above, and of gold the door-latch.\n",
      "90\n",
      "On either side of each door stood gold and silver dogs\n",
      "created with consummate skill by Hephaistos and set there\n",
      "to keep watch over the house of great-hearted Alkinoös:\n",
      "immortal creatures and ageless all their days.\n",
      "Inside, chairs were set on both sides along the wall\n",
      "95\n",
      "from the threshold through to the inmost chamber, and on them\n",
      "were laid soft, fine-woven covers, the work of women,\n",
      "and here it was that the Phaiakian leaders would sit,\n",
      "drinking and eating: unfailing abundance was theirs.\n",
      "Youths made of gold there were too, standing on solid\n",
      "100\n",
      "pedestals, who held blazing torches in their hands\n",
      "to light up the night for those at dinner in the great hall.\n",
      "And there were fifty house slaves there in the hall, women,\n",
      "of whom some were grinding yellow grain in a mill\n",
      "and others weaving on looms or twirling the distaff\n",
      "105\n",
      "as they sat there like a tall aspen’s flickering leaves;\n",
      "and from the close-woven fabrics dripped the soft oil.1\n",
      "For just as Phaiakian men were skilled above all others\n",
      "at steering a swift ship over the deep, so too their women\n",
      "were expert weavers: Athēnē had given them unsurpassed\n",
      "110\n",
      "understanding of exquisite handiwork, and clever minds.\n",
      "Outside the courtyard, close to the doors, was a large\n",
      "four-acre orchard, with a hedge in place all round it:\n",
      "there fruit trees flourished, luxuriant and tall,\n",
      "pears, pomegranates, ripe-fruited apple trees,\n",
      "115\n",
      "sweet fig trees and abundantly fertile olives.\n",
      "The produce of these never failed or perished, either\n",
      "in winter or summer, but lasted throughout the year:\n",
      "some fruits the west wind’s breeze grew, others it ripened;\n",
      "pear mellowed upon pear here, apple on apple,\n",
      "120\n",
      "grape cluster upon cluster, fig upon fig. There too\n",
      "was rooted a vineyard, richly productive, of which\n",
      "one part was a warm sun-trap on level ground for drying,\n",
      "while clusters elsewhere were being culled at vintage\n",
      "or trodden; and grapes still unripe, out in front, were either\n",
      "125\n",
      "shedding their blossom or darkening to purple. There too,\n",
      "by the last row of vines, grew well-planned vegetable beds\n",
      "of every variety, bright green the whole year through;\n",
      "and there were two springs, one discharging its water over\n",
      "the whole garden, the other rising by the courtyard threshold\n",
      "130\n",
      "toward the high house. From this the townsfolk drew their water.\n",
      "Such were the gods’ fine gifts in Alkinoös’ domain.\n",
      "Much-enduring godlike Odysseus stood there and gazed;\n",
      "But when in his heart he’d marveled at everything, then\n",
      "he quickly stepped over the threshold and into the building,\n",
      "135\n",
      "where he found the Phaiakians’ leaders and counselors pouring\n",
      "libations from their cups to Argos’ far-sighted slayer,\n",
      "to whom they would pour the last drink when thinking of bedtime.\n",
      "Much-enduring godlike Odysseus went through the hall, concealed\n",
      "by the thick mist that Athēnē had earlier shed around him\n",
      "140\n",
      "till he came to where Arētē was, and the king Alkinoös.\n",
      "About the knees of Arētē, Odysseus now threw his arms,\n",
      "and then at once the divine mist lifted from him,\n",
      "and all in the hall fell silent at the sight of the man, and they\n",
      "stared at him in amazement as Odysseus made his appeal:\n",
      "145\n",
      "“Arētē, godlike Rhēxēnōr’s daughter, after much hardship\n",
      "I come as a suppliant to your husband and your knees—\n",
      "and to those dining here—may the gods grant them plenty\n",
      "in this life, and may each of them bequeath to his children\n",
      "the wealth in his halls, and all honors his people gave him!\n",
      "150\n",
      "I beg you, give me an escort to get to my own country,\n",
      "and soon: I’ve long suffered much, far from my dear ones.”\n",
      "So saying, down he sat at the hearth, among the ashes\n",
      "close by the fire. They all were hushed and silent. At last\n",
      "there spoke among them the elderly hero Echenēos,\n",
      "155\n",
      "a man who’d seen more years than any Phaiakian,\n",
      "well skilled at speaking, well versed in ancient wisdom:\n",
      "he with good intent now addressed the assembly, saying:\n",
      "“Alkinoös, this is not the best way, nor is it seemly, to let\n",
      "a stranger sit on the ground, at the hearth among the ashes—\n",
      "160\n",
      "but people are holding back, awaiting your word! Come then,\n",
      "raise the stranger up, and give him a silver-studded\n",
      "chair to sit on, tell the heralds to mix more wine\n",
      "that we may pour libations to Zeus, hurler of bolts,\n",
      "the protector of sacrosanct suppliants! And also let\n",
      "165\n",
      "the housekeeper give this stranger dinner from her store.”\n",
      "When Alkinoös, princely in power, heard these words, he took\n",
      "the wise, subtle-minded Odysseus by the hand, and raised him\n",
      "up from the hearth, and seated him on a shining chair—\n",
      "making his son get up, the kindly Laodamas,\n",
      "170\n",
      "who sat next to him, and was the one whom he loved best.\n",
      "A maid brought hand-washing water in a fine golden\n",
      "pitcher, and poured it into a silver basin, so he\n",
      "could wash, and drew up a polished table beside him.\n",
      "The respected housekeeper brought and set out bread,\n",
      "175\n",
      "with many side dishes, giving freely of her supplies.\n",
      "Much-enduring and godlike Odysseus drank and ate.\n",
      "Then Alkinoös, princely in power, said to the herald:\n",
      "“Pontonoös, mix a bowlful, serve wine to all in the hall,\n",
      "that we may pour libations to Zeus, hurler of bolts,\n",
      "180\n",
      "the protector of sacrosanct suppliants!”\n",
      "So he spoke,\n",
      "and Pontonoös came and mixed the mind-honeying2 wine\n",
      "and served it to all, with first drops for libation. But when\n",
      "they’d made libation and drunk as much as the heart desired,\n",
      "Alkinoös then addressed them, speaking as follows:\n",
      "185\n",
      "“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\n",
      "while I tell you what the heart in my breast dictates.\n",
      "Now that you’ve dined, go home and get your rest:\n",
      "tomorrow, early, we’ll summon more of the elders,\n",
      "welcome this stranger here in our halls, and offer\n",
      "190\n",
      "choice sacrifice to the gods. Then we’ll further consider\n",
      "the matter of his conveyance, how without toil or trouble,\n",
      "carried by us, he’s to reach his native country—\n",
      "however far distant that may be—soon and rejoicing;\n",
      "nor on the way shall he suffer any harm or setback\n",
      "195\n",
      "until he sets foot on his own land—although thereafter\n",
      "he’ll suffer whatever his fate and the weighty Spinners3 have spun\n",
      "with his birth-thread right from the moment his mother bore him!\n",
      "But if he’s some kind of immortal, come down from heaven,\n",
      "then this is a new gambit of the gods’ contriving, since\n",
      "200\n",
      "always till now they’ve appeared to us plainly manifest\n",
      "whenever we offer them our most lavish sacrifices,\n",
      "and they feast among us, sitting where we sit ourselves.\n",
      "What’s more, if a solitary traveler should meet them on the road\n",
      "they don’t use disguise, since we’re close kin to them,\n",
      "205\n",
      "like the Kyklōpes or the wild tribes of the Giants.”4\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Alkinoös, don’t let that bother you: I am not in any way\n",
      "like the immortals who hold the broad heavens, either\n",
      "physically or in nature: I look, and am, mortal, a man!\n",
      "210\n",
      "Whoever you know of mankind that shoulder the heaviest load\n",
      "of grief, to them I might liken myself in my sorrows—\n",
      "and indeed I could tell a yet longer tale of all\n",
      "the troubles I’ve endured by the will of the gods!\n",
      "But first let me eat some dinner, grieving though I am:\n",
      "215\n",
      "for nothing exists more shameless than one’s loathsome belly,\n",
      "that forces a man to take notice of it at need, however\n",
      "distressed he may be and stricken by grief at heart,\n",
      "as I am grief-stricken at heart now; yet still unremittingly\n",
      "it commands me to eat and drink, forces me to forget\n",
      "220\n",
      "everything I have suffered, insists on being refilled!\n",
      "But will you please make haste, at daybreak’s first appearance,\n",
      "to set me, the ill-starred one, on the road to my own country\n",
      "after all my troubles: let life leave me, once I’ve seen\n",
      "my possessions, my servants, and my great high-roofed house.”\n",
      "225\n",
      "So he spoke: they all applauded and approved the dispatch\n",
      "of the stranger, since his request had been properly presented.\n",
      "When they’d made libation and drunk as much as the heart desired,\n",
      "they went, each man to his home, to get their repose;\n",
      "and godlike Odysseus was left there in the hall\n",
      "230\n",
      "with Arētē and godlike Alkinoös sitting beside him,\n",
      "while the maidservants cleared away the remains of dinner.\n",
      "Then white-armed Arētē was the first to speak, for she\n",
      "had recognized his mantle and tunic at first sight\n",
      "as fine clothes she herself and her serving women had made;\n",
      "235\n",
      "so now she spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, this question I’ll ask first myself: Who are you,\n",
      "and from where? Who gave you these clothes? Did you not\n",
      "say that you arrived here while wandering over the deep?”\n",
      "Then, responding to her, resourceful Odysseus declared:\n",
      "240\n",
      "“It’s hard, my queen, to render an exhaustive account\n",
      "of my troubles: the heavenly gods have given me so many!\n",
      "But this I will tell you, in response to your enquiry:\n",
      "There’s an island, Ōgygia, that lies far off in the deep,\n",
      "and the daughter of Atlas, crafty Kalypsō, lives there,\n",
      "245\n",
      "a dread fair-tressed goddess; with her there’s no one else\n",
      "has intercourse, be it of gods or of mortal humans,\n",
      "but unfortunate that I am, some god brought me alone\n",
      "to her hearth, after Zeus struck my swift ship with a bright\n",
      "bolt, and destroyed it in the midst of the wine-dark deep.\n",
      "250\n",
      "There all the rest of my staunch companions perished,\n",
      "but I clutched in my arms the keel of my curved vessel\n",
      "and was borne off for nine days: on the tenth dark night\n",
      "the gods landed me on Ōgygia, where Kalypsō dwells—\n",
      "that dread fair-tressed goddess! She welcomed me, took me in,\n",
      "255\n",
      "gave me food, treated me kindly, said she would make me\n",
      "immortal and ageless all my days; but she never\n",
      "could persuade the heart in my breast. There I remained\n",
      "for seven unbroken years,5 keeping ever damp with my tears\n",
      "the immortal garments in which Kalypsō clothed me.\n",
      "260\n",
      "But when in its cycle the eighth year arrived for me, then\n",
      "she urged and told me to be on my way once more—\n",
      "either she’d had a message from Zeus or else her own mind\n",
      "had changed—and sent me off on a well-bound raft, and gave me\n",
      "plenty of bread and sweet wine, with immortal clothes to wear,\n",
      "265\n",
      "and raised a good tailwind for me, both mild and breezy.\n",
      "For seventeen days then I sailed on over the deep,\n",
      "and on the eighteenth your country’s shadowy mountains\n",
      "came into sight, and the heart within me rejoiced.\n",
      "But I was out of luck: I still had plenty of trouble\n",
      "270\n",
      "to live with, directed against me by Poseidōn the Earth-Shaker,\n",
      "for he raised up winds to confront me, delayed my journey\n",
      "by horribly roiling the sea, with waves that would not\n",
      "let me sail on, even miserably, aboard my raft: the storm\n",
      "broke it up! Nevertheless, I still somehow managed\n",
      "275\n",
      "to swim my way through this great gulf of the sea, until\n",
      "wind and wave carried me to your coast. Had I attempted\n",
      "to land there, the waves would have hurled me upon the strand,\n",
      "dashed me against great rocks at this cheerless site;\n",
      "But I kept well clear, and swam on, until I reached the river,\n",
      "280\n",
      "and this seemed to me the best possible landing place,\n",
      "being smooth of rocks and offering shelter against the wind.\n",
      "Out then I stumbled, half dead, and ambrosial night\n",
      "came on. I got clear of the heaven-fed river, lay down\n",
      "to sleep in the bushes, heaped up piles of leaves\n",
      "285\n",
      "around me: some god shed over me limitless sleep.\n",
      "So there in the leaves, much troubled at heart, I slumbered\n",
      "the whole night through, and next morning until midday\n",
      "and later—the sun was declining when at last sweet sleep\n",
      "released me. Then I saw your daughter’s maids at play\n",
      "290\n",
      "on the shore, and herself among them, like a goddess.\n",
      "To her I appealed: she knew what was proper behavior—\n",
      "a virtue you’d not expect to find a young casually met\n",
      "person displaying: the young are always so thoughtless!\n",
      "She offered me food in abundance and sparkling wine\n",
      "295\n",
      "and had me washed in the river and gave me these clothes.\n",
      "Distressed I may be, but everything I’ve told you is the truth.”\n",
      "Then Alkinoös made him this answer, saying: “Stranger,\n",
      "my child did not behave correctly in one respect: she should\n",
      "have brought you here to our home, along with her handmaids,\n",
      "300\n",
      "since she was the first to whom you made your supplication.”\n",
      "Then in answer to him resourceful Odysseus declared:\n",
      "“Hero, do not for this rebuke your blameless daughter!\n",
      "She did indeed tell me to follow her with her handmaids,\n",
      "But I would not, being scared and embarrassed, in case\n",
      "305\n",
      "you might be somehow offended by the sight; we’re all\n",
      "very suspicious-minded, we breeds of men here on earth.”\n",
      "Alkinoös again responded to him, saying: “Stranger,\n",
      "the heart in my breast is not the kind to become irate\n",
      "without good cause: due measure is always better.\n",
      "310\n",
      "No, I could wish—Zeus, Father, Athēnē, Apollo!—that you,\n",
      "being the kind of man you are, with a mind like my own,\n",
      "might have my daughter, be known as my son-in-law,\n",
      "and be domiciled here: a house and property I’d give you\n",
      "were you willing to stay! But against your will shall no\n",
      "315\n",
      "Phaiakian detain you—never be that Zeus the Father’s wish!\n",
      "For your convoy I set a day, that you may know it surely:\n",
      "tomorrow. Then you’ll lie down, overmastered by sleep,\n",
      "and they’ll row you over a calm sea until you arrive\n",
      "at your country and home—or whatever place you fancy,\n",
      "320\n",
      "even if it’s somewhere far more distant than Euboia,\n",
      "the most remote of lands6—or so say those of our people\n",
      "who saw it when they conveyed the fair-haired Rhadamanthys\n",
      "to go visit Tityos, son of Gaia.7 Thither they voyaged,\n",
      "without effort completed their journey, and came back\n",
      "325\n",
      "home that same day! So shall you too discover\n",
      "by how much my vessels are the best, and my young men\n",
      "at sweeping the salt sea with their oar blades.”\n",
      "So he spoke.\n",
      "Much-enduring godlike Odysseus, rejoicing, uttered\n",
      "a personal prayer, in these words: “Zeus, Father, grant\n",
      "330\n",
      "that he, Alkinoös, may accomplish all he’s promised!\n",
      "So shall his fame spread, unquenchable, over all\n",
      "the grain-giving earth, and I get home to my own country!”\n",
      "Such the words they exchanged in discussion with one another.\n",
      "White-armed Arētē now instructed her handmaids\n",
      "335\n",
      "to set up a bedstead down in the colonnade, and on it\n",
      "to spread fine purple blankets, with coverlets over them,\n",
      "and on top of these fleecy mantles to wear as wraps. The maids\n",
      "went out of the hall with torches held in their hands,\n",
      "and after they’d finished draping the close-strung bedstead,\n",
      "340\n",
      "they came back to Odysseus, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, up with you now, your bed is made and ready.”\n",
      "Thus they spoke, and welcome he found it to lie down and rest.\n",
      "There, then, he slept, much-enduring godlike Odysseus,\n",
      "on the corded bedstead down in the echoing colonnade.\n",
      "345\n",
      "But Alkinoös took his repose in the high house’s inmost room,\n",
      "and beside him his lady wife now shared their bed and marriage.\n",
      "Book 8\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "Alkinoös, princely in power, arose from his slumber,\n",
      "and Odysseus, the Zeus-born sacker of cities, rose too.\n",
      "Alkinoös, princely in power, now led the way to\n",
      "the Phaiakians’ assembly place, built for them near their ships:\n",
      "5\n",
      "On arrival there they sat down on the polished stones\n",
      "side by side, while Pallas Athēnē went through the city\n",
      "in the likeness of the herald of sagacious Alkinoös,\n",
      "working on the return of great-hearted Odysseus. To each\n",
      "man she met she would say, as she stood beside him:\n",
      "10\n",
      "“Come now, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\n",
      "attend the assembly, and hear all about the stranger\n",
      "who’s recently come to the house of sagacious Alkinoös\n",
      "from being lost on the deep—in form he’s like the immortals!”\n",
      "So saying she stirred up each man’s heart and spirit,\n",
      "15\n",
      "and quickly the seats of assembly were all filled up\n",
      "by gathering men, many of whom now marveled\n",
      "at the sight of Laërtēs’ sagacious son, for Athēnē had shed\n",
      "a wondrous grace over his head and shoulders, made him\n",
      "appear both taller and sturdier, so that he might\n",
      "20\n",
      "be welcome to all the Phaiakians, and inspire\n",
      "awe and respect, and accomplish the numerous feats\n",
      "in which the Phaiakians were to make trial of Odysseus.\n",
      "When they were all in place and gathered together,\n",
      "Alkinoös made a speech, addressed the assembly, saying:\n",
      "25\n",
      "“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\n",
      "while I tell you what the heart in my breast dictates. This stranger—\n",
      "who he is I don’t know—has wandered here to my house,\n",
      "whether from men of the east or the west. He wants\n",
      "conveyance, and is begging us for assurance on that.\n",
      "30\n",
      "So let us, as in the past, provide him swift conveyance:\n",
      "for no other man who’s appeared at my house has had to wait\n",
      "in misery overlong for the convoy that he needed!\n",
      "So come, let’s haul a black ship down to the bright sea\n",
      "for its maiden voyage; let those fifty-two young men,\n",
      "35\n",
      "the best crew in the district, be chosen to serve aboard it;\n",
      "and then, when each man has fastened his oar to its rowlock,\n",
      "disembark, come up to my house, partake of a quick meal—\n",
      "on me, I’ll make ample provision for everybody involved!\n",
      "That’s my order to the young men. As for you others,\n",
      "40\n",
      "you sceptered princes, come on up to my beautiful dwelling,\n",
      "so we can entertain the stranger as guest in our halls,\n",
      "and let no man refuse me! Also fetch the divine minstrel,\n",
      "Dēmodokos: for to him the god’s granted an unmatched gift\n",
      "of song, to please, however his spirit may bid him sing.”\n",
      "45\n",
      "That said, he led the way, and the sceptered princes followed,\n",
      "while a herald went off to fetch the divine minstrel,\n",
      "and the chosen youths, two and fifty of them, obeyed\n",
      "his orders, and made their way to the unharvested sea,\n",
      "and when they reached the ship and the sea, they hauled\n",
      "50\n",
      "the black vessel down to deep water, and in its black hull\n",
      "proceeded to step the mast, to set the sails, and secure\n",
      "the oars to the leather straps of the rowlocks, all in due order.\n",
      "This done, they spread the white sail, then anchored the vessel\n",
      "well out in deep water. This done, they took themselves off\n",
      "55\n",
      "to the great abode of sagacious Alkinoös. There they found\n",
      "all the courtyards and colonnades and chambers crowded\n",
      "with the many guests that had gathered, both young and old.\n",
      "For them Alkinoös slaughtered a dozen sheep and eight\n",
      "white-tusked boars and a couple of shambling oxen: these\n",
      "60\n",
      "they skinned and dressed, and made ready a delectable feast.\n",
      "Now the herald returned, bringing the trusty minstrel,\n",
      "whom the Muse loved dearly, but gave him both good and ill:\n",
      "she robbed him of eyesight, yet made him a sweet singer.\n",
      "The herald Pontonoös set him a silver-studded chair\n",
      "65\n",
      "amid the feasters, leaned it against a tall pillar,\n",
      "hung the clear-toned lyre from a peg up over his head,\n",
      "and instructed him how to find it with his hands: so far\n",
      "the herald. Beside him he placed a basket and fine table,\n",
      "along with a cup of wine to drink from when so minded.\n",
      "70\n",
      "Now they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them;\n",
      "but when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink\n",
      "the Muse stirred the minstrel to sing of the famous deeds of men\n",
      "from that lay the fame of which had reached the wide heavens—\n",
      "the quarrel between Odysseus and Pēleus’ son, Achillēs,\n",
      "75\n",
      "how once they contended at a sumptuous feast of the gods\n",
      "with vehement words, and the king of men, Agamemnōn,\n",
      "was glad at heart that the best Achaians were in contention,\n",
      "for thus Phoibos Apollō had told him, when giving a response\n",
      "in sacred Pythō, after he’d crossed the threshold of stone\n",
      "80\n",
      "to enquire of the oracle: then it was that the start of trouble\n",
      "came rolling on Trojans and Danaäns on account of great Zeus’ plans.\n",
      "This theme the famous minstrel chose. But Odysseus\n",
      "took his great purple mantle in his powerful hands\n",
      "and pulled it down over his head, to hide his handsome face,\n",
      "85\n",
      "ashamed to be shedding tears before the Phaiakians.\n",
      "Every time the divine minstrel had a pause in his singing\n",
      "Odysseus would wipe off the tears, lift the mantle from his head,\n",
      "take a two-handled cup and pour a libation to the gods;\n",
      "but when he began again—the Phaiakian nobles would urge him\n",
      "90\n",
      "to sing more, for they took great pleasure in his lays—\n",
      "then Odysseus would once more cover his head and sigh.\n",
      "His weeping escaped the notice of all the others; only\n",
      "Alkinoös was aware of it and took notice, since he sat\n",
      "beside him, and could hear his heavy sighing. At once\n",
      "95\n",
      "he addressed himself to the Phaiakians, oar-lovers all:\n",
      "“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians:\n",
      "by now we’ve slaked our desire for the shared banquet\n",
      "and the lyre that’s the accompaniment to ample feasting;\n",
      "now let’s go out and make trial in every kind of athletic\n",
      "100\n",
      "contest, so that this stranger may tell his friends,\n",
      "when he gets back home, how far we outstrip other men\n",
      "in boxing and wrestling, in jumping and running.”\n",
      "That said,\n",
      "he led the way, and they followed him. On its peg\n",
      "the herald hung up the clear-toned lyre, and took\n",
      "105\n",
      "Dēmodokos by the hand, led him out of the hall\n",
      "and followed the same road just taken by the other\n",
      "Phaiakian nobles to watch the contests. They went\n",
      "to the place of assembly: a large throng accompanied them,\n",
      "countless in number; there stood up many fine young men.\n",
      "110\n",
      "Up got Akroneōs, Ōkyalos and Elatreus,\n",
      "Nauteus and Prymneus, Anchialos and Eretmeus,\n",
      "Ponteus and Prōreus, Thoōn and Anabēsineōs,\n",
      "with Amphialos, the son of Polynēos, Tektōn’s son;\n",
      "up, too, Euryalos, peer of man-killing Arēs,\n",
      "115\n",
      "Naubolos’ son, the best in looks and stature—\n",
      "bar only peerless Laodamas—of all the Phaiakians;\n",
      "and up got the three sons of matchless Alkinoös:\n",
      "Laodamas, Halios, and godlike Klytonēos.\n",
      "These then first made trial of themselves in the footrace:\n",
      "120\n",
      "the pace was hot from the start, they all raced together,\n",
      "speedily kicking up the dust from the plain; but of them\n",
      "peerless Klytonēos proved by far the swiftest runner,\n",
      "and by the length of the furrow mules plow in fallow land\n",
      "he got back first to the crowd, well ahead of all the rest.\n",
      "125\n",
      "Then they competed in the painful art of wrestling,\n",
      "and here Euryalos outdid all the best competitors;\n",
      "at jumping Amphialos had no rivals in the field,\n",
      "while with the discus Elatreus was an easy winner,\n",
      "and at boxing Laodamas, Alkinoös’ splendid son.\n",
      "130\n",
      "But after they’d all enjoyed these athletic contests,\n",
      "Laodamas, Alkinoös’ son, had this to say to them:\n",
      "“Come, friends, let us ask the stranger if there’s any contest\n",
      "that he knows and has practiced. In build he’s not a weakling—\n",
      "look at his thighs and calves, both arms above them,\n",
      "135\n",
      "his sturdy neck: great strength there! He’s not lacking\n",
      "in manly vigor, but just broken by many misfortunes:\n",
      "for to my mind there’s nothing worse than the sea\n",
      "to break down a man, even though he be the strongest.”\n",
      "Then Euryalos in turn responded to him, saying:\n",
      "140\n",
      "“Laodamas, what you propose is rightly spoken!\n",
      "Go challenge him now yourself, tell him what you told us.”\n",
      "When Alkinoös’ good son heard this, he went and stood\n",
      "in the midst, and addressed Odysseus as follows, saying:\n",
      "“Come on, stranger, father: you too should try these contests\n",
      "145\n",
      "if haply you’re skilled in any: and it’s likely that you are\n",
      "so skilled, for a man’s life can show no greater glory\n",
      "than what he achieves with his own hands and feet.\n",
      "So come, make trial of yourself, scatter care from your heart!\n",
      "Your journey won’t long be delayed now, already your ship\n",
      "150\n",
      "is hauled down and launched, your companions all are ready.”\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Laodamas, why do you make me this mocking challenge?\n",
      "My mind is far fuller of sorrows than of contests:\n",
      "Before now I have suffered much, endured much hardship;\n",
      "155\n",
      "now here in your assembly I sit, and seek my homecoming,\n",
      "making my plea to your king and to his people as a whole.”\n",
      "Euryalos then replied, taunting him to his face:\n",
      "“No, indeed, stranger, you don’t look to me like a man\n",
      "familiar with contests, such as mankind has in plenty;\n",
      "160\n",
      "you’re more the sort that goes to and fro with his many-\n",
      "oared vessel, a captain of sailors who also are traders,\n",
      "taking care of his freight, an overseer of cargo\n",
      "and gain got by greed. You don’t look to me like an athlete.”\n",
      "With an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded:\n",
      "165\n",
      "“Sir, that was not well said; you sound like some reckless\n",
      "badmouth! It’s true that the gods don’t hand out gracious\n",
      "gifts to all men, of either looks, or wit, or eloquence: one man\n",
      "will make a less impressive appearance, and yet\n",
      "the god crowns his speech with grace, people regard him\n",
      "170\n",
      "with admiring pleasure, his utterances are sure,\n",
      "respectful and honey-sweet: he stands out in a crowd,\n",
      "and as he goes through the city, men look on him as a god.\n",
      "Another may be as handsome as the immortals, but\n",
      "no crown of grace will be set on his public speaking—\n",
      "175\n",
      "and so with you: your looks are outstanding, not even\n",
      "a god could improve them, but in mind you’re inadequate.\n",
      "You’ve provoked the heart in my breast by your mannerless\n",
      "mode of address: I’m no novice at sporting contests\n",
      "as you assert—no, I reckon I ranked among the first\n",
      "180\n",
      "while I could safely trust in my vigor and my hands;\n",
      "but now trouble and grief possess me: much I’ve endured,\n",
      "cutting my path through men’s wars and the damaging waves.\n",
      "Yet despite my great suffering I’ll make trial of your contests,\n",
      "for your words gnaw at my heart, what you said drives me on.”\n",
      "185\n",
      "So saying, he sprang up, still in his mantle, and seized\n",
      "a stone quoit—one bigger, thicker, and weightier by far\n",
      "than those the Phaiakians used to compete against each other.\n",
      "This he whirled about and let fly from his mighty hand,\n",
      "and the stone whirred: down they crouched on the ground,\n",
      "190\n",
      "did the long-oared Phaiakians, men famous for their ships,\n",
      "beneath the stone’s flight. Past the marks of all it flew,\n",
      "fast sped from his hand, and Athēnē—in the likeness of a man—\n",
      "checked the length of the cast, and then addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Even a blind man, stranger, could distinguish this cast of yours\n",
      "195\n",
      "by feeling for it: it’s not mixed up with the rest but well\n",
      "ahead of them all. This contest at least should encourage you—\n",
      "No Phaiakian will equal your cast, much less get past it.”\n",
      "So she spoke. Much-enduring godlike Odysseus rejoiced,\n",
      "glad to have met with a friendly supporter at these contests.\n",
      "200\n",
      "Then, in a lighter mood, he spoke among the Phaiakians:\n",
      "“Match that cast now, young men! I’ll soon let fly another,\n",
      "its equal in length, or maybe an even longer shot!\n",
      "As for the rest of you, if anyone’s heart and spirit\n",
      "so bids him, come on, let him try me, since you’ve got me angry—\n",
      "205\n",
      "boxing, wrestling, or running, I don’t care which,\n",
      "any Phaiakian, except for Laodamas in person,\n",
      "he being my host: who’d fight the one that befriended him?\n",
      "Witless the man and worthless that would ever challenge\n",
      "to a contest the host who gave him a kindly welcome\n",
      "210\n",
      "in some foreign country: he’d cut all his own hopes short!\n",
      "But of the rest there’s none I either refuse or slight:\n",
      "I want to learn their strength, to test myself against them.\n",
      "For I’m no slouch all round in the contests that men practice—\n",
      "well do I know how to handle a polished bow,\n",
      "215\n",
      "and always I’d be the first to shoot and hit my man\n",
      "in the thick of the enemy, though many of my comrades\n",
      "were standing beside me, loosing off arrows at the foe.\n",
      "Philoktētēs alone it was who excelled me at archery\n",
      "in the land of the Trojans, when we Achaians were shooting!\n",
      "220\n",
      "Of the rest I can claim to be the best by far\n",
      "of all mortals that now eat bread upon this earth,\n",
      "though I have no wish to compete with those of former times,\n",
      "with Hēraklēs or Oichalian Eurytos, such men\n",
      "as competed in marksmanship even with the immortals.\n",
      "225\n",
      "For that was why great Eurytos died young, why no old age\n",
      "caught up with him in his halls: Apollo, furious, slew him\n",
      "because he’d challenged the god to an archery contest. What’s more,\n",
      "I can throw a spear further than any man can shoot an arrow!\n",
      "In the footrace alone I fear I may be outrun by some\n",
      "230\n",
      "Phaiakian: I’ve been harshly battered by countless waves,\n",
      "and aboard my ship I had no long-term care for my body,\n",
      "which is why my limbs are now very badly out of trim.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and they all remained hushed in silence. Only\n",
      "Alkinoös made him an answer, addressed him saying:\n",
      "235\n",
      "“Stranger, your words here among us were not ungracious,\n",
      "but due to your wish to make clear your innate prowess—\n",
      "being angered, because that man confronted you in this contest\n",
      "and mocked you, in a way no mortal who was aware\n",
      "of how to speak fittingly would disparage your prowess.\n",
      "240\n",
      "So come now, give heed to my words, that you may tell them\n",
      "to some other hero, when in your own great hall\n",
      "you’re feasting, together with your wife and children,\n",
      "and recall our feats, the achievements that to us too\n",
      "Zeus has constantly granted since the days of our fathers.\n",
      "245\n",
      "Now we’re not unmatched as boxers, or as wrestlers, but in\n",
      "the footrace we run swiftly; we’re the best of seamen,\n",
      "and dear to us always are feasting, and dancing, and the lyre,\n",
      "and changes of clothes, hot baths, and bed. So come,\n",
      "all you Phaiakians who are our finest dancers,\n",
      "250\n",
      "foot it gaily, so that the stranger may report to his friends,\n",
      "after getting back home, how far we surpass all others\n",
      "in seamanship, fleetness of foot, and dancing and singing!\n",
      "And let someone go at once and fetch for Dēmodokos\n",
      "the clear-toned lyre that’s lying somewhere in our halls.”\n",
      "255\n",
      "So spoke godlike Alkinoös, and the herald got up\n",
      "to go fetch the hollow lyre from the king’s domain.\n",
      "Then nine umpires arose, all chosen by popular vote,\n",
      "whose job was to regulate every detail of the games.\n",
      "They leveled a dancing floor, cleared a fine open space,\n",
      "260\n",
      "and the herald approached, bringing the clear-toned lyre\n",
      "for Dēmodokos, who then went to the middle, and round him\n",
      "stood young men in youth’s first bloom, well skilled at dancing,\n",
      "and performed the steps of the sacred dance. Odysseus,\n",
      "marveling, watched the flash of their feet as they moved.\n",
      "265\n",
      "Dēmodokos now struck his lyre to introduce the fine lay\n",
      "about Arēs’ love for sweet-garlanded Aphrodītē1—\n",
      "how they first lay together in the house of Hephaistos,\n",
      "secretly, how he showered her with gifts, shamed the marital\n",
      "bed of the lord Hephaistos, to whom Hēlios promptly came\n",
      "270\n",
      "with the news that he’d seen them making love. And when\n",
      "Hephaistos heard his heart-rending tattle, he went\n",
      "off to his smithy, secretly planning revenge,\n",
      "and set on its block the great anvil, and hammered out bonds\n",
      "unbreakable and unloosable, made to hold fast when set;\n",
      "275\n",
      "then, having fashioned this snare in his fury against Arēs,\n",
      "he went to the chamber where his own dear bedstead stood\n",
      "and circled the bonds round the bedposts from every angle:\n",
      "many he hung overhead, attached to the rafters, as fine\n",
      "as spiders’ webs, so that none could see them, not even\n",
      "280\n",
      "one of the blessed gods, so craftily were they fashioned.\n",
      "Then, when he’d placed his snares all around the bed, he made\n",
      "as though he was going to Lēmnos, that well-built citadel,\n",
      "of all lands on earth to him by far the dearest. And no\n",
      "blind watch did golden-reined Arēs keep, but when\n",
      "285\n",
      "he saw the famed craftsman Hephaistos departing, he went\n",
      "straight off to the house of the same famous Hephaistos,\n",
      "his mind imagining sex with sweet-garlanded Kythereia.2\n",
      "Now she from a spell with her father, the mighty son of Kronos,\n",
      "had just arrived, and sat down: Arēs entered the house\n",
      "290\n",
      "and took her by the hand, and addressed her, saying:\n",
      "“Come, my love, let’s to bed and its pleasures: for no longer\n",
      "is Hephaistos around here, but I think is on his way\n",
      "to Lēmnos, off there visiting the rough-spoken Sintians.”3\n",
      "Such his words, and she welcomed the prospect of bedding him.\n",
      "295\n",
      "They went to bed and lay down. But the crafty bonds devised\n",
      "by artful Hephaistos immobilized them: they were unable\n",
      "to move their limbs, let alone get up. Then they knew the truth,\n",
      "that for them no longer was there any chance of escape.\n",
      "So the far-famed double cripple came home and found them,\n",
      "300\n",
      "having turned back before he reached the land of Lēmnos,\n",
      "since Hēlios kept watch for him, brought him the news.\n",
      "He went to his house now, deeply troubled at heart,\n",
      "and stood there in the forecourt, gripped by a wild fury,\n",
      "and with a terrible shout cried out to all the gods:\n",
      "305\n",
      "“Zeus! Father! All you other blessed immortal gods!\n",
      "Come see a sight both ridiculous and unseemly—\n",
      "the way because I’m lame Zeus’ daughter Aphrodītē\n",
      "dishonors me constantly by loving destructive Arēs\n",
      "because he’s strong-limbed and handsome, whereas I\n",
      "310\n",
      "was born misshapen, for which there’s no one to blame\n",
      "but my two parents—would they’d never had me! Now you\n",
      "shall see for yourselves the way they go to make love\n",
      "in my own bed, to me a grievous sight—yet somehow\n",
      "I don’t imagine they’ll want to lie thus a minute longer\n",
      "315\n",
      "however much they’re in love: they’ll soon lose the urge\n",
      "for sleep—rather those crafty bonds will hold them tight\n",
      "until her father pays back to me every single bride-gift\n",
      "I lavished on him in return for his bitch of a daughter,\n",
      "since the daughter’s beautiful, but lacking in self-restraint.”\n",
      "320\n",
      "So he spoke, and the gods came crowding to his bronze-floored\n",
      "house: Poseidōn, the Earth-Embracer, along with Hermēs,\n",
      "the helper, and Lord Apollō, the deadly archer; but\n",
      "the female deities stayed, every one, at home for shame.\n",
      "So there they stood in the doorway: gods, givers of good things,\n",
      "325\n",
      "and laughter unquenchable rose among the blessed gods\n",
      "as they gazed at the crafty work of ingenious Hephaistos,\n",
      "and thus would one of them say, with a glance at his neighbor:\n",
      "“Ill deeds don’t thrive! The slow catches the swift,\n",
      "just as now Hephaistos the laggard has caught Arēs,\n",
      "330\n",
      "though of the gods holding Olympos he’s the swiftest;\n",
      "though lame, he caught him by guile. Now Arēs must pay\n",
      "the adulterer’s fine.” So they spoke to one another.\n",
      "But to Hermēs the lord Apollo, the son of Zeus, now said:\n",
      "“Hermēs, Zeus’ son, guide, giver of good things, would you\n",
      "335\n",
      "be ready, even if hard-pressed by such powerful bonds,\n",
      "to sleep in a bed at the side of golden Aphrodītē?”\n",
      "Then the guide, the slayer of Argos, answered him: “How I wish,\n",
      "Lord Apollo, deadly archer, that this might come to pass—\n",
      "with three times as many unshakable bonds set round me,\n",
      "340\n",
      "and you gods, with all the goddesses too, looking on—\n",
      "that I might sleep at the side of golden Aphrodītē!”\n",
      "At his words laughter arose among the immortal gods.\n",
      "Poseidōn, though, was not laughing, but kept entreating\n",
      "Hephaistos, the far-famed craftsman, to set Arēs free:\n",
      "345\n",
      "he spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Free him,\n",
      "and I promise on his behalf, as you require, that he will\n",
      "pay the full proper sum before the immortal gods.”\n",
      "Then the far-famed double cripple answered him thus:\n",
      "“Do not demand this of me, Poseidōn, Earth-Embracer:\n",
      "350\n",
      "a pledge made on behalf of the worthless is a worthless pledge!\n",
      "And how could I constrain you among the immortal gods\n",
      "were Arēs to dodge both debt and bond and just vanish?”\n",
      "Then Poseidōn the Earth-Shaker responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Hephaistos, even were Arēs to renege on the debt he owes\n",
      "355\n",
      "and take off in flight, I myself will pay the total sum.”\n",
      "The far-famed double cripple responded to this, saying:\n",
      "“I cannot refuse your offer: that would not be seemly.”\n",
      "So saying, the mighty Hephaistos unlocked the snares,\n",
      "and the two, once freed from the snares, despite their strength,\n",
      "360\n",
      "sprang up at once: he, Arēs, now took himself off to Thrace,\n",
      "while she, smiling Aphrodītē, left for Paphos on Cyprus,\n",
      "where she had her sacred precinct and fragrant altar.\n",
      "There the Graces bathed her, anointed her with ambrosial\n",
      "oil, such as soothes the skin of the gods who are forever,\n",
      "365\n",
      "and clothed her in elegant raiment, a wonder to behold.\n",
      "This was the lay the famed minstrel sang; and Odysseus\n",
      "listened with great enjoyment, as did the others,\n",
      "the long-oared Phaiakians, men famous for their ships.\n",
      "Then Alkinoös had Halios and Laodamas dance—\n",
      "370\n",
      "alone, since no one else could match their performance.\n",
      "They took in their hands an exquisite purple ball,\n",
      "that the skilled artist Polybos had fashioned for them,\n",
      "and one would toss it high to the shadowy clouds,\n",
      "leaning back, while the other would leap high off the ground\n",
      "375\n",
      "and easily catch it before his feet touched earth again.\n",
      "But when they’d tested their skill at throwing the ball\n",
      "straight up, then they danced upon the grain-giving earth,\n",
      "quickly tossing the ball to and fro, while the other youths\n",
      "stood beating time, and a din of stamping feet arose.\n",
      "380\n",
      "Then godlike Odysseus addressed Alkinoös, saying:\n",
      "“Alkinoös, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\n",
      "you claimed that these your dancers were unrivaled,\n",
      "and they’ve proved it true: I’m awed by the sight of them.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and Alkinoös, princely in power, rejoiced,\n",
      "385\n",
      "and at once addressed the oar-loving Phaiakians, saying:\n",
      "“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians:\n",
      "this stranger seems to me a man of the highest discretion!\n",
      "Come then, let’s give him a guest-gift, as is befitting:\n",
      "twelve renowned princes hold sway in this our country\n",
      "390\n",
      "as rulers, and I myself am the thirteenth: let each\n",
      "one of the twelve now bring him a fresh-washed mantle\n",
      "and tunic, as well as a talent of precious gold,\n",
      "and let’s collect all this now, so that the stranger\n",
      "may go happy to supper, holding our gifts in his hands—\n",
      "395\n",
      "and let Euryalos make amends to him in person,\n",
      "with words and a gift: what he said was most unfitting.”\n",
      "So he spoke: they all approved, and endorsed the offer,\n",
      "and each sent off a herald to fetch the gifts,\n",
      "and Euryalos in his turn now responded, saying:\n",
      "400\n",
      "“Alkinoös, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\n",
      "I shall indeed makes amends to the stranger, as you bid me.\n",
      "I’ll give him this all-bronze sword, which possesses a hilt\n",
      "of silver, and a scabbard of fresh-sawn ivory\n",
      "encases it. It will be of great value to him.”\n",
      "That said,\n",
      "405\n",
      "to Odysseus he handed over the silver-studded sword,\n",
      "and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Greetings, father,\n",
      "stranger: if any word that’s been uttered was improper,\n",
      "may storm winds now snatch it up and carry it off! And may\n",
      "the gods grant you see your wife, reach your own country:\n",
      "410\n",
      "Too long you’ve endured hardship far from your dear ones.”\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Greetings to you too, friend! May the gods enrich you,\n",
      "and may you never hereafter be seized by longing for\n",
      "this sword you’ve given me—with a handsome apology.”\n",
      "415\n",
      "That said, he hung from his shoulders the silver-studded sword,\n",
      "and the sun went down, and the glorious gifts appeared.\n",
      "Noble heralds now bore them to Alkinoös’ abode,\n",
      "where the sons of peerless Alkinoös took charge of these\n",
      "exquisite presents, and set them before their revered\n",
      "420\n",
      "mother. Alkinoös, princely in power, led them,\n",
      "and in they came and sat down on the high-backed chairs.\n",
      "Then mighty Alkinoös addressed himself to Arētē:\n",
      "“My wife, bring a fine chest here, the best we have,\n",
      "and in it put a fresh-laundered mantle and a tunic,\n",
      "425\n",
      "and set a bronze cauldron to warm on the fire, heat water in it,\n",
      "so that when the stranger has bathed and had a good look\n",
      "at all the gifts the peerless Phaiakians brought here,\n",
      "he may then enjoy the feast, and the minstrel’s singing;\n",
      "and I shall make him a present of this fine golden\n",
      "430\n",
      "cup of mine, that he may remember me all his days\n",
      "when he pours in his hall libations to Zeus and the other gods.”\n",
      "So he spoke; and Arētē gave orders to her handmaids\n",
      "to set over the fire a great cauldron as quickly as they could.\n",
      "They settled the bathwater cauldron on the blazing flames\n",
      "435\n",
      "and filled it with water and under it kindled firewood.\n",
      "Flames lapped the cauldron’s belly, the water grew hot,\n",
      "while Arētē fetched for the stranger an exquisite chest\n",
      "from her storeroom, and in it placed the beautiful gifts—\n",
      "the clothes, the gold—that the Phaiakians provided,\n",
      "440\n",
      "together with a mantle and fine tunic that she put in\n",
      "herself, then addressed Odysseus with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Take care of the lid yourself, put a quick knot on it,\n",
      "lest someone rob you during your homeward journey,\n",
      "while you’re traveling, sweetly asleep, aboard that black ship.”\n",
      "445\n",
      "When much-enduring godlike Odysseus heard those words\n",
      "he at once fitted the lid on, and quickly secured it with\n",
      "a complex knot he’d once learned from the lady Kirkē.\n",
      "Then promptly the housekeeper called him to go and be scrubbed\n",
      "in the bathtub, and he rejoiced in his heart on seeing\n",
      "450\n",
      "the warm bath, since such care had been far from frequent\n",
      "ever since he’d left the home of fair-tressed Kalypsō,\n",
      "though till then he’d been cared for continually like a god.\n",
      "So when the handmaids had bathed him, rubbed him with oil,\n",
      "they dressed him in a splendid mantle and tunic, and he\n",
      "455\n",
      "stepped away from the bathtub and went to join the men\n",
      "at their wine. And Nausikaä, whose beauty was from the gods,\n",
      "stood by the pillar supporting the close-packed roof,\n",
      "and marveled at Odysseus as she took in his appearance,\n",
      "and spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "460\n",
      "“Farewell, stranger: even when you’re back in your own country\n",
      "remember me: I was the first to whom you owed your life.”\n",
      "In answer to her resourceful Odysseus then said:\n",
      "“Nausikaä, daughter of great-hearted Alkinoös,\n",
      "so now may Zeus, Hērē’s loud-thundering husband,\n",
      "465\n",
      "let me return to see the day of my homecoming!\n",
      "There too I’ll pray to you as I would to a god\n",
      "all the days of my life: for you saved my life, my dear.”\n",
      "With that he sat down on the chair beside King Alkinoös.\n",
      "By now they were serving out portions and mixing the wine,\n",
      "470\n",
      "and the herald came in leading the trusty minstrel\n",
      "Dēmodokos, much honored by the people, set his chair\n",
      "in the midst of the diners, backed against a high pillar.\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus addressed himself to the herald\n",
      "as he cut off a piece of the chine—more still was left—\n",
      "475\n",
      "from a white-tusked boar, with rich fat on either side:\n",
      "“Here, herald, take this cut and give it to eat\n",
      "to Dēmodokos: I salute him, despite my grief:\n",
      "for among all men worldwide minstrels receive their share\n",
      "of honor and reverence, since the Muse has taught them\n",
      "480\n",
      "the ways of song, and has love for the whole tribe of singers.”\n",
      "So he spoke: the herald took it and placed it in the hands\n",
      "of the hero Dēmodokos. He accepted it with pleasure.\n",
      "Now they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them;\n",
      "but when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "485\n",
      "then resourceful Odysseus addressed Dēmodokos, saying:\n",
      "“Dēmodokos, higher than all mortal men I praise you,\n",
      "whether it was the Muse, Zeus’ daughter, or Apollō\n",
      "that taught you, for you sing truly of the Achaians’ fate—\n",
      "all that they did and suffered, every hardship they endured,\n",
      "490\n",
      "as though you’d been there yourself, or were told by one who had!\n",
      "But change your theme now, and tell us about the Horse,\n",
      "the Wooden Horse that Epeios made with Athēnē’s help,\n",
      "and Odysseus led up to the citadel, a deceptive trap,\n",
      "after filling it with the men who sacked Ilion. If indeed\n",
      "495\n",
      "you perform this lay in right fashion, then I’ll declare,\n",
      "to all mankind, that the god, with a propitious heart,\n",
      "has bestowed upon you the gift of divine song.”\n",
      "So he spoke.\n",
      "Setting out from the god, the other began to narrate the tale,\n",
      "from when the Argives embarked on their well-benched ships\n",
      "500\n",
      "and sailed away, after setting fire to the huts,\n",
      "while those led by far-famed Odysseus were already sitting\n",
      "in the Trojan place of assembly, concealed in the Horse.\n",
      "The Trojans themselves had hauled it into the citadel, and\n",
      "with it standing there they made many indecisive speeches\n",
      "505\n",
      "sitting around it. Three proposals found supporters:\n",
      "to cut through its hollow timbers with the pitiless bronze,\n",
      "to drag it up to the summit and push it over the edge,\n",
      "or leave it as a great offering to propitiate the gods—\n",
      "which in the event, was what was destined to happen,\n",
      "510\n",
      "for it was their fate to perish when the city enfolded\n",
      "that great horse of wood, in which sat all the best\n",
      "of the Argives, bringing the Trojans massacre and death.\n",
      "How the Achaians’ sons then sacked the city he sang,\n",
      "as they poured from the horse, leaving their hollow ambush;\n",
      "515\n",
      "how they variously laid the steep city waste as they fought\n",
      "through it: how Odysseus, like Arēs, together with godlike\n",
      "Menelaös pressed on to the house of Deïphobos. There\n",
      "it was, he said, that he dared his most terrible battle,\n",
      "and won in the end through the aid of great-hearted Athēnē.\n",
      "520\n",
      "This was the lay the far-famed minstrel sang. But Odysseus\n",
      "melted: tears from under his eyelids wet his cheeks.\n",
      "And as a woman wails and clings to her dear husband\n",
      "who’s fallen fighting to save his city and his people,\n",
      "warding off from township and children the pitiless day,\n",
      "525\n",
      "and she sees him dying and gasping for breath, collapses\n",
      "on him, shrieking aloud, while enemies behind her\n",
      "batter her back and shoulders with their spears,\n",
      "and drag her away into slavery, to a life of toil and grief,\n",
      "while with most pitiful sorrow her cheeks are wasted—\n",
      "530\n",
      "such pitiful tears Odysseus now shed beneath his brows.\n",
      "His weeping escaped the notice of all the others; only\n",
      "Alkinoös was aware of it and took notice, since he sat\n",
      "beside him, and could hear his heavy sighing. At once\n",
      "he addressed himself to the Phaiakians, oar-lovers all:\n",
      "535\n",
      "“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\n",
      "and let Dēmodokos silence his clear-toned lyre,\n",
      "for the lay he’s singing does not please every listener.\n",
      "Since we began our feast, and the divine singer arose,\n",
      "he’s never—I mean the stranger—ceased from heartfelt\n",
      "540\n",
      "lamentation: some great grief must have assailed his mind!\n",
      "Then let the minstrel stop, so we all can enjoy ourselves,\n",
      "both hosts and guest: this is much the better way, since\n",
      "it’s for our respected guest all this has been laid on:\n",
      "his conveyance, the kindly gifts we’ve given him as friends.\n",
      "545\n",
      "Dear as a brother the stranger and suppliant is regarded\n",
      "by any man whose wits have the slightest grasp of wisdom.\n",
      "Do not, therefore, stranger, hide behind deceptive phrasing\n",
      "the true answers to what I shall ask you: best to speak plainly.\n",
      "Tell me the name by which your mother and father\n",
      "550\n",
      "called you back there, and the others in your town and district,\n",
      "for there’s none of mankind is wholly without a name,\n",
      "neither common nor noble, from the time he was born,\n",
      "but at their birth their parents fasten names on them all.\n",
      "And tell me your country, your district and your city,\n",
      "555\n",
      "that our ships may convey you thither, steering by their wits—\n",
      "for among the Phaiakians there exist no steersmen,\n",
      "nor indeed steering oars, such as other vessels possess;\n",
      "the ships themselves understand men’s purposes and minds,\n",
      "and know all the cities of men, their fertile plowland,\n",
      "560\n",
      "and the gulf of the salt deep they traverse most speedily,\n",
      "hidden in mist and cloud; nor do they ever have\n",
      "the slightest fear of encountering damage or shipwreck.\n",
      "Yet once I heard a story related by my father,\n",
      "Nausithoös: he used to say that Poseidōn was angry\n",
      "565\n",
      "with us, because we give safe convoy to all and sundry.\n",
      "One day, he said, a most beautiful Phaiakian vessel\n",
      "returning from escort duty out on the misty deep,\n",
      "he’d smite, and hide our city with a great mountain round it.\n",
      "So said the old man; the god will either fulfill this\n",
      "570\n",
      "or leave it unfulfilled, as the fancy takes him. But come,\n",
      "tell me this, and give me a true account of it: where\n",
      "have your wanderings taken you, to what countries\n",
      "of men have you come, their people, their populous cities,\n",
      "whether rough and wild and uncivilized, or those\n",
      "575\n",
      "that welcome strangers, and have god-fearing minds !\n",
      "And tell me what makes you weep and lament at heart\n",
      "as you hear the fate of the Danaän Argives, of Ilion:\n",
      "this the gods fashioned, and spun the thread of destruction\n",
      "for mankind, that there might be a song for those yet to come.\n",
      "580\n",
      "Did some kinsman of yours, perhaps, lose his life before Ilion?\n",
      "Some fine warrior, wife’s father or son-in-law, those\n",
      "who are closest to you after your own flesh and blood? Or was it\n",
      "a comrade maybe, one especially dear to you,\n",
      "this fine warrior? For in no way less than a brother\n",
      "585\n",
      "is he who’s a comrade and whose mind embraces wisdom.”\n",
      "Book 9\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Alkinoös, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\n",
      "it is indeed a good thing to listen to such a minstrel\n",
      "as this man is, who resembles the gods in his singing!\n",
      "There is, I’d say, no greater fulfillment of pleasure\n",
      "5\n",
      "than when all the people share a common enjoyment,\n",
      "and those feasting in the halls are listening to a minstrel\n",
      "as they sit there in order, and all the tables are loaded\n",
      "with bread and meat, and the cupbearer draws off wine\n",
      "from the bowl, and pours it into the cups. Indeed,\n",
      "10\n",
      "to me this seems the very best kind of occasion.\n",
      "But your spirit has moved you to ask about my unhappy\n",
      "troubles, that I may weep and sigh still further.\n",
      "What then shall I tell you first, what later? The heavenly\n",
      "gods have laid on me sorrows past counting. First,\n",
      "15\n",
      "now, I’ll tell you my name, that you all may know it,\n",
      "and afterwards, if I escape the pitiless day, I may\n",
      "in turn be your host, far off though I make my home.\n",
      "I am Odysseus, Laërtēs’ son, well known to all mankind\n",
      "for my crafty devices: my fame goes up to heaven.\n",
      "20\n",
      "My home is in sunny Ithákē: there’s a mountain on it,\n",
      "a landmark, Nēriton, leaf-clad; and around it are many\n",
      "islands, set close each one to its next neighbor—\n",
      "Doulichion, Samē, and forested Zákynthos.\n",

      "night, but the rest are apart, nearer dawn and sunrise.1\n",
      "It’s rough land, but fine for raising young men. Myself,\n",
      "I can’t think of a sweeter sight than one’s own country.\n",
      "Kalypsō, bright among goddesses, kept me with her, it’s true,\n",
      "in her hollow caves, wanting me for her husband;\n",
      "30\n",
      "and Kirkē likewise detained me in her halls,\n",
      "that wily Aiaian lady, wanting me for her husband;\n",
      "but neither could ever persuade the heart in my breast—\n",
      "so sure as nothing’s sweeter than a man’s own country\n",
      "and forebears, though he may live far away in a rich home\n",
      "35\n",
      "in some foreign land, and quite remote from his parents.\n",
      "“But come, let me tell you now of the grief-laden homecoming\n",
      "that Zeus afflicted me with on my way back home from Troy.\n",
      "From Ilion the wind drove me, brought me to the Kikones,\n",
      "to Ismaros. There I sacked the city, slaughtered the men.\n",
      "40\n",
      "From the city we took both the wives and a heap of goods\n",
      "and divided them. I made sure none got less than a fair share.\n",
      "Then I was all for us light-footing it out of there,\n",
      "and so urged; but the rest, the great fools, refused to listen.\n",
      "Then much wine was drunk, and many a sheep they slew\n",
      "45\n",
      "along the shore, many crumple-horned shambling steers.\n",
      "The Kikones meanwhile had gone and appealed to other Kikones,\n",
      "their neighbors—more numerous, and more courageous too,\n",
      "who dwelt on the mainland, and knew all about fighting\n",
      "from chariots as well as, where necessary, on foot.\n",
      "50\n",
      "They came now, as thick as leaves and flowers in season,\n",
      "at dawn: then indeed an ill fate from Zeus beset us,\n",
      "out of luck as we were, brought us a mass of troubles.\n",
      "By the swift ships they stood and fought: each side\n",
      "attacked the other with their bronze-tipped spears.\n",
      "55\n",
      "While it was morning still, while the sacred day increased,\n",
      "we stood firm and held them off, despite their numbers;\n",
      "but once the sun had reached the hour for unyoking oxen,\n",
      "then the Kikones broke the Achaians and overwhelmed them,\n",
      "and six of our well-greaved comrades from each ship\n",
      "60\n",
      "died, but the rest of us dodged death and destiny. So\n",
      "we sailed on from there, lamenting at heart, but glad\n",
      "at having got clear of death, though we’d lost our comrades.\n",
      "Nor did I let our curved ships proceed any further\n",
      "until we’d all called out three times to each of our luckless\n",
      "65\n",
      "comrades who’d died on the plain, cut down by the Kikones.\n",
      "Yet against our ships cloud-gathering Zeus still roused\n",
      "the north wind, with an awesome tempest, and hid\n",
      "both land and deep sea behind clouds: night sprang from heaven.\n",
      "Our ships were driven on sidelong, fragments—three, four—\n",
      "70\n",
      "were ripped from the sails by the violence of the wind.\n",
      "So, scared of destruction, we lowered them to the deck,\n",
      "and rowed our way hastily landward. There for two\n",
      "nights and two days continuously we lay to,\n",
      "eating our hearts out with sorrow and sheer exhaustion;\n",
      "75\n",
      "but when fair-haired Dawn brought on the third day, then\n",
      "we stepped the masts, hoisted the white sails, and took\n",
      "our seats: the wind and the helmsmen steered our vessels.\n",
      "And then unscathed I would have come back to my own country;\n",
      "but as I was rounding Cape Malea the waves and the current\n",
      "80\n",
      "and the north wind drove me off course, sent me past Kythēra.\n",
      "For the next nine days I was borne on by deadly winds\n",
      "over the fish-rich sea; on the tenth I set foot\n",
      "on the land of the Lotus-Eaters, who feed off a flowery food.\n",
      "Here we went ashore and replenished our store of water,\n",
      "85\n",
      "and my comrades now had a meal, there by the swift ships.\n",
      "But when we’d gotten our fill of food and drink,\n",
      "then I sent out some comrades to go ahead and discover\n",
      "what kind of people, among earth’s bread-eaters, dwelt here—\n",
      "two men I chose, and a third to go with them as herald.\n",
      "90\n",
      "They went straight off, and soon found the Lotus-Eaters;\n",
      "and these Lotus-Eaters, far from wanting to kill\n",
      "our comrades, offered them lotus to eat. Now none\n",
      "who consumed the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus any longer\n",
      "had the urge to bring news back or continue the voyage,\n",
      "95\n",
      "but were set upon staying right there, with the Lotus-Eaters,\n",
      "munching lotus, their homecoming all forgotten.\n",
      "These men I myself dragged weeping back to the ships,\n",
      "and tied them up below deck in the hollow vessels,\n",
      "and ordered all the rest of my trusty companions\n",
      "100\n",
      "to board the swift ships without delay, lest any\n",
      "by eating the lotus should forget their homecoming.\n",
      "So they quickly embarked, and, seating themselves at the rowlocks,\n",
      "ranged in good order, struck the grey brine with their oars.\n",
      "“From there we sailed on further, grieving at heart, until\n",
      "105\n",
      "we reached the Kyklōpes’ country—an arrogant, lawless\n",
      "people who, relying upon the immortal gods,\n",
      "with their own hands plant nothing, nor do they plow;\n",
      "but everything flourishes for them, unplowed, unsown:\n",
      "wheat and barley, and vines that bear rich clusters\n",
      "110\n",
      "of grapes; and the rain of Zeus makes them grow. They have\n",
      "neither assemblies for counsel nor established customs,\n",
      "but make their homes near the summits of high mountains\n",
      "in hollow caves, and each man lays down the law\n",
      "to his children and wives: they care nothing for one another.\n",
      "115\n",
      "“A fertile island’s spread out there, beyond the harbor,\n",
      "neither near the Kyklōpes’ land, nor yet remote from it,\n",
      "well wooded: on it countless wild goats flourish,\n",
      "for no human comings and goings get in their way,\n",
      "nor do hunters disturb them, men who have it rough\n",
      "120\n",
      "tracking game in the woodland over the mountain tops;\n",
      "nor is it grazed on by flocks or put under the plow,\n",
      "but unsown and unplowed all its days it stays bereft\n",
      "of humankind, supports nothing but bleating goats.\n",
      "For the Kyklōpes have no vermilion-cheeked vessels,\n",
      "125\n",
      "nor in their land are there shipwrights, who might build them\n",
      "well-benched ships that could answer all their needs,\n",
      "take them to other men’s countries (as often enough\n",
      "men traverse the sea in ships to call upon one another)—\n",
      "men who could also develop the island for them,\n",
      "130\n",
      "for it’s far from poor and could grow every crop in season:\n",
      "on it are meadows, beyond the banks of the salt-grey sea,\n",
      "soft and well watered: vines would never lack moisture,\n",
      "the earth’s good for plowing, they could reap deep-standing\n",
      "harvests in season, so rich is the subsoil. Here too\n",
      "135\n",
      "is a good safe harbor, with no need of moorings, either\n",
      "anchor stones to throw out or stern warps to secure:\n",
      "one can just beach one’s vessel and wait till the crew are minded\n",
      "to put to sea, and get a soft following wind.\n",
      "At the head of the harbor there’s bright water flowing,\n",
      "140\n",
      "a spring from under a cave, with poplars growing round it.\n",
      "There we sailed in, and some god gave us guidance\n",
      "through the murky night, for there was no light to see by:\n",
      "a deep mist lay round the ships, nor did the moon\n",
      "shed any light from heaven, but was obscured by clouds.\n",
      "145\n",
      "None got a glimpse of that island, nor could we see\n",
      "the long breakers rolling in on the shore, until\n",
      "we beached all our well-benched vessels, and, that done,\n",
      "lowered the sails on each one of them, and ourselves\n",
      "then disembarked on the seashore, and lay down\n",
      "150\n",
      "to sleep, and awaited the coming of dawn and brightness.\n",
      "“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "we went exploring the island, in amazement at it,\n",
      "and the nymphs, the daughters of aegis-bearing Zeus,\n",
      "sent out the mountain goats, to give my comrades dinner.\n",
      "155\n",
      "At once we took from the ships curved bows and long-socketed\n",
      "goat-spears, and forming ourselves into three groups\n",
      "went hunting, and right off some god provided us\n",
      "with a most satisfactory bag. Twelve ships came with me,\n",
      "and each got nine goats by lot; for me alone they chose ten.\n",
      "160\n",
      "“So then for the rest of the day until the sun went down\n",
      "we sat eating abundant meat and drinking the sweet wine,\n",
      "for not yet was all the red wine in our ships consumed,\n",
      "but some remained; each crew had drawn off a great deal\n",
      "in jars, when we sacked the Kikones’ sacred citadel.\n",
      "165\n",
      "Now we were looking across at the nearby Kyklōpes’ country—\n",
      "saw smoke, heard their voices, the bleat of their sheep and goats.\n",
      "But when the sun had set and darkness came on,\n",
      "then we lay down and slept along the line of the shore.\n",
      "“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "170\n",
      "I called an assembly and declared before them all:\n",
      "‘The rest of you stay here now, my trusty comrades:\n",
      "I with my own ship and my own crew will go over\n",
      "and find out about these men—who they may be,\n",
      "whether they’re violent creatures, savage, and lawless,\n",
      "175\n",
      "or hospitable people, men with god-fearing minds.’\n",
      "“That said, I boarded my vessel, ordered my companions\n",
      "to embark themselves, and to cast off the stern warps.\n",
      "They came aboard quickly, seated themselves at the rowlocks,\n",
      "and sitting in order struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\n",
      "180\n",
      "But when we got to the place, quite near at hand, there at\n",
      "the land’s edge, close to the sea, we saw a cave,\n",
      "high, overgrown with laurels, where abundant flocks\n",
      "of sheep and goats spent the night. Around it a high\n",
      "wall had been built, with stones sunk deep in the ground,\n",
      "185\n",
      "and long timbers of pine and lofty-crested oak.\n",
      "There a monstrous man had his dwelling, who all alone\n",
      "herded his flocks far off, consorted with no others,\n",
      "but lived by himself, mind bred in lawlessness:\n",
      "a monstrous wonder, resembling not so much\n",
      "190\n",
      "any bread-eating mortal, but rather the wooded peak\n",
      "of some lofty mountain, standing out apart from the rest.\n",
      "“Then I ordered the rest of my trusty comrades to stay there,\n",
      "where they were, by the ship, and to stand guard over it;\n",
      "but I, having chosen the twelve best among my comrades,\n",
      "195\n",
      "went on, taking a goatskin full of the sweet dark wine\n",
      "that Marō gave me—Marō, Euanthēs’ son and priest\n",
      "of Apollō, the guardian of Ismaros—because we had\n",
      "protected him, together with his wife and his child,\n",
      "out of reverence: his dwelling was in a wooded grove\n",
      "200\n",
      "of Phoibos Apollō, and he gave me splendid gifts:\n",
      "of fine-wrought gold he bestowed on me seven talents,\n",
      "with a mixing bowl all of silver, besides the wine,\n",
      "with which he filled a dozen large jars in all,\n",
      "sweet and unmixed, a heavenly drink: not one\n",
      "205\n",
      "of his house servants or handmaids had knowledge of it,\n",
      "only himself, and his wife, and one woman, their housekeeper;\n",
      "and whenever they drank this honey-sweet red wine\n",
      "he’d mix one cup of wine with twenty measures of water,\n",
      "and from the bowl would rise an aroma of marvelous\n",
      "210\n",
      "sweetness—then indeed to abstain would be no pleasure!\n",
      "With this wine I filled and took with me a sizable goatskin,\n",
      "and a leather bag packed with food, for my sharp mind sensed\n",
      "that the man we were going to encounter, clad in huge strength,\n",
      "was wild, with no knowledge of justice or civil rights.\n",
      "215\n",
      "“So we quickly came to the cave, but did not find him\n",
      "inside: he was out, tending his fat flocks at pasture.\n",
      "Then we entered the cave, amazed by all we saw there:\n",
      "baskets loaded with cheeses, pens full of lambs\n",
      "and kids. Each age-group was sorted out separately—\n",
      "220\n",
      "the older ones by themselves, the middlers likewise,\n",
      "the newborn too. All the pans were brimming with whey,\n",
      "the buckets and bowls, well wrought, that he used for milking.\n",
      "Right off, my comrades spoke up, implored me to take\n",
      "some of the cheeses and leave, then quickly to drive\n",
      "225\n",
      "kids and lambs from the pens back to our swift ship,\n",
      "and sail away over the deep salt sea. But I would not\n",
      "listen—far better indeed had I done so!—for I wanted\n",
      "to meet this man, find out if he’d treat me as a guest.\n",
      "No joy was he to my comrades when he did appear!\n",
      "230\n",
      "“So we lit a fire, and made sacrifice, and ourselves\n",
      "took some of the cheeses and ate them, sat there inside\n",
      "waiting, till he returned with his flock, hefting a great\n",
      "load of dry firewood to serve him at suppertime,\n",
      "and dumped it down with a crash as he came inside.\n",
      "235\n",
      "We shrank back, terrified, into the back of the cave,\n",
      "while he drove his fat flocks into the roomy cavern—\n",
      "all, that is, that he milked; the males he left outside,\n",
      "he-goats and rams, there in the deep yard. Then\n",
      "he lifted and put in place a huge and massive\n",
      "240\n",
      "door stone: not twenty-two four-wheeled wagons,\n",
      "strong ones, would have sufficed to raise it off the threshold,\n",
      "such a towering mass of rock he set in the doorway!\n",
      "Then down he sat and milked the ewes and bleating she-goats,\n",
      "all in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\n",
      "245\n",
      "Next, once he’d curdled half the white milk, he collected\n",
      "the curds in wicker baskets and put them aside.\n",
      "The remaining half he left in the pails, so it would be handy\n",
      "to take and drink, and be ready for him at supper.\n",
      "But after he’d busied himself with these tasks, he rekindled\n",
      "250\n",
      "the fire, and caught sight of us, and questioned us, saying:\n",
      "‘So, strangers, who are you? From where was it you sailed here\n",
      "over the watery ways? On business? Or do you rove at random,\n",
      "cruising the sea like pirates, who, at risk of their own lives,\n",
      "go around making trouble for men from other lands?’\n",
      "255\n",
      "“So he spoke, and we succumbed to panic in our hearts,\n",
      "terrified by his deep voice and his monstrous person;\n",
      "yet even so I responded, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "‘We are, if you please, Achaians, driven wandering from Troy\n",
      "by all the winds, across the great gulf of the sea,\n",
      "260\n",
      "seeking our homes, but blown on a different route,\n",
      "the wrong paths: Zeus, I guess, must have planned it thus.\n",
      "We are, we claim, men serving Atreus’ son Agamemnōn—\n",
      "whose fame now is unsurpassed under heaven, so great\n",
      "a city he sacked, so many people he slew! But we\n",
      "265\n",
      "who come to you now are suppliants, clasp your knees,\n",
      "hoping you’ll treat us as guests, or in some other way\n",
      "give us some kind of present, as is proper with strangers.\n",
      "Kind sir, revere the gods! We are here as your suppliants,\n",
      "and Zeus is the protector of suppliants and strangers,\n",
      "270\n",
      "the strangers’ god, who looks after respectful guests.’\n",
      "“So I spoke. And he with pitiless heart responded:\n",
      "‘You’re a fool, stranger, or you must come from far away,\n",
      "telling me either to fear or to steer clear of the gods!\n",
      "The Kyklōpes pay no attention to Zeus of the aegis,\n",
      "275\n",
      "nor to the blessed gods—we’re far mightier than they!\n",
      "Nor would I, to avoid the wrath of Zeus, spare either\n",
      "you or your comrades, unless the spirit so moved me!\n",
      "But where, coming here, did you leave your well-built ship?\n",
      "Far off was it, or nearby? Tell me: I’d like to know.’\n",
      "280\n",
      "“So he spoke, testing me; but I knew too much to be tricked,\n",
      "and when I replied it was with guile of my own:\n",
      "‘My ship was broken up by Poseidōn the Earth-Shaker,\n",
      "who cast it upon the rocks at the frontier of your country:\n",
      "close to the headland he drove it: the wind brought it ashore.\n",
      "285\n",
      "But I, and these men here, eluded sheer destruction.’\n",
      "“So I spoke. He, with ruthless heart, made me no answer,\n",
      "but sprang up, laid hands on my comrades, grappled two,\n",
      "and down on the ground, as though they were mere puppies,\n",
      "dashed them: their brains spilled earthwards, wetted the floor.\n",
      "290\n",
      "Then limb from limb he tore them to prepare his supper,\n",
      "and devoured them like a mountain-bred lion, leaving nothing—\n",
      "innards and flesh, bones with the marrow in them,\n",
      "while we, lamenting, reached out our hands to Zeus\n",
      "at the sight of such bestial deeds. Helplessness overmastered\n",
      "295\n",
      "our hearts. When the Kyklōps had glutted his vast belly\n",
      "by gobbling human flesh, washed down with unmixed milk,\n",
      "he settled to sleep in the cave, stretched out among his sheep.\n",
      "So I planned an attack on him in my great-hearted spirit:\n",
      "I’d steal up close, draw the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\n",
      "300\n",
      "and drive it into his breast, where the midriff cups the liver,\n",
      "finding the spot with my hand. But a second thought stopped me—\n",
      "we too would have perished there, faced sheer destruction,\n",
      "for we could never have thrust back from the lofty\n",
      "entrance with our bare hands the huge stone he’d set there,\n",
      "305\n",
      "and so, lamenting, we lay there, awaiting the bright Dawn.\n",
      "“As soon as Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "he rekindled the fire, and began milking his fine flocks,\n",
      "all in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\n",
      "Then after he’d briskly accomplished his various tasks\n",
      "310\n",
      "he again grabbed two men together, and readied his meal.\n",
      "When he’d eaten, he drove his fat flocks out of the cave,\n",
      "easily shifting the enormous door-stone, and afterwards\n",
      "setting it back in place, like the lid on a quiver.\n",
      "Then, whistling loudly, the Kyklōps steered his fat flocks\n",
      "315\n",
      "uphill, and I was left there, planning mischief deep in my heart—\n",
      "to get back at him, have Athēnē let me boast of what I’d done!\n",
      "“Now this was the plan that seemed, to my mind, the likeliest:\n",
      "The Kyklōps had left a great club beside a sheep pen,\n",
      "of green olive wood, that he’d cut to carry with him\n",
      "320\n",
      "when it had dried out. Eyeing this, we compared it\n",
      "in size to the mast of a black ship of twenty oars,\n",
      "a broad-beamed merchantman, one that crosses the great\n",
      "sea gulf—so huge did its length and breadth look to us.\n",
      "I went and chopped off a piece about a fathom long:\n",
      "325\n",
      "handed this to my comrades, told them to scrape it down,\n",
      "and they made it smooth, while I stood there and sharpened\n",
      "its point, then took and hardened it in the blazing fire,\n",
      "and stowed it out of sight, hiding it under the dung\n",
      "that was strewn throughout the cave in heaped-up piles.\n",
      "330\n",
      "I ordered the others to cast lots to decide\n",
      "which ones would dare, with me, to hoist up this stake\n",
      "and ram it into his eye, when sweet sleep overcame him.\n",
      "The lot picked out the same ones whom I’d have chosen,\n",
      "four of them; with these, as the fifth, I picked myself.\n",
      "335\n",
      "“In the evening back he came, herding his fine-fleeced flocks,\n",
      "and straightway drove his fat flocks into the wide cave—\n",
      "all of them, left none outside in the deep enclosure:\n",
      "some idea of his own, perhaps—or a god’s command?2\n",
      "He lifted and put in place the huge and massive door-stone,\n",
      "340\n",
      "then sat down and milked the ewes and bleating she–goats,\n",
      "all in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\n",
      "Then after he’d briskly accomplished his various tasks\n",
      "he again grabbed two men together, and readied his meal.\n",
      "It was now that I spoke to the Kyklōps, going and standing\n",
      "345\n",
      "beside him, in my hands an ivy-wood bowl of dark wine:\n",
      "‘Here, Kyklōps, drink this wine, now you’ve fed on human flesh,\n",
      "and learn what fine wine it is that’s stowed aboard our ship:\n",
      "I was bringing it as a libation, hoping you’d feel pity\n",
      "for me, and send me on homeward; but your mad fury\n",
      "350\n",
      "is not to be borne! Cruel wretch, how in future will any man\n",
      "in the world come near you? What you’ve done is an outrage.’\n",
      "“So I spoke. He took the wine, drained it, was vastly pleased\n",
      "as he swilled the sweet stuff, demanded a second bowlful:\n",
      "‘Quick, give me some more—and also tell me your name,\n",
      "355\n",
      "now, at once! I want to give you a guest-gift you’ll enjoy!\n",
      "For the Kyklōpes too the grain-giving earth bears vines\n",
      "with rich clusters of grapes, and Zeus’ rain makes them grow;\n",
      "but this—this is a match for ambrosia and nectar!’\n",
      "“So he spoke; and I once more brought him the bright wine.\n",
      "360\n",
      "Three bowlfuls I fetched and gave him, three times in his folly\n",
      "he drained them. Then, when the wine had fuddled his wits,\n",
      "I addressed him with honey-sweet words, saying: ‘Kyklōps,\n",
      "do you ask me my famous name? Very well, I will tell you—\n",
      "and then you give me that guest-gift, just as you promised!\n",
      "365\n",
      "Nobody is my name, Nobody’s what I’m called by\n",
      "my mother and father and all my comrades.’\n",
      "“So I spoke,\n",
      "and at once he with pitiless heart responded: ‘Nobody\n",
      "I shall eat last of all, when I’ve had all his companions,\n",
      "and the others first: so, that will be your guest-gift.’\n",
      "370\n",
      "“So saying, he swayed and fell on his back, lay sprawling\n",
      "with his thick neck twisted sideways: overmastering sleep\n",
      "possessed him, from his gullet there gushed out wine\n",
      "and gobbets of human flesh, as he drunkenly vomited.\n",
      "It was now that I thrust the stake deep into the embers\n",
      "375\n",
      "to let it get hot, and encouraged all my companions\n",
      "with heartening words, lest any back off from fear.\n",
      "Then, just as the olive-wood stake, though green, was about\n",
      "to catch fire, and was glowing, intensely incandescent,\n",
      "I leaned close, pulled it clear of the flames. My companions\n",
      "380\n",
      "crowded around me. Some god breathed great courage into us.\n",
      "The others grasped the olive-wood stake, sharp-pointed,\n",
      "and rammed it into his eye, while I leaned over it,\n",
      "and twisted it round. As when a man with a drill\n",
      "bores a ship timber, and those below keep it turning\n",
      "385\n",
      "with a strap held at either end, and the drill runs nonstop—\n",
      "just so we grasped and in his eye kept turning\n",
      "that fire-sharpened stake: round the red-hot orb blood ran.\n",
      "Eyelids and eyebrows alike were singed by the fiery breath\n",
      "from the burning eyeball: its roots now crackled in the heat.\n",
      "390\n",
      "As when a blacksmith plunges a great axe or an adze\n",
      "in cold water to temper it, and it hisses loudly—\n",
      "for this is how iron achieves its greatest strength—just so\n",
      "did his eye now hiss around the olive-wood point. He gave\n",
      "a terrible scream, that made the rock resound,\n",
      "395\n",
      "and we shrank back in terror. He tore the stake, all slobbered\n",
      "with fresh-shed blood, from his eye, and with both arms\n",
      "hurled it from him, maddened with pain, and screamed aloud\n",
      "to the other Kyklōpes, those who were his neighbors,\n",
      "dwelling in caves near the windswept mountaintops,\n",
      "400\n",
      "and they heard him cry out, and gathered from all around,\n",
      "and stood by the cave and asked him what was the matter:\n",
      "‘What great hurt, Polyphēmos, is it makes you scream like that\n",
      "through the ambrosial night, and rouse us all from sleep?\n",
      "Surely no mortal is rustling your flocks against your will?\n",
      "405\n",
      "Surely you’re not being murdered by guile or by force?’\n",
      "“From within\n",
      "the cave mighty Polyphēmos answered them thus: ‘My friends,\n",
      "Nobody’s killing me by guile, not by force.’ To this,\n",
      "addressing him with winged words, they now responded:\n",
      " ‘If no one is harming you, then, and you’re alone, there’s no\n",
      "410\n",
      "way you can dodge a sickness sent by great Zeus: you must\n",
      "just offer up prayers to our father, Lord Poseidōn.’\n",
      "“So they spoke,\n",
      "and departed. I laughed in my heart at the way that name,\n",
      "and my faultless planning, had so deceived them. Meanwhile\n",
      "the Kyklōps, groaning and suffering agonies of pain,\n",
      "415\n",
      "groped with his hands, took the stone from the cave’s entrance,\n",
      "and sat there in the opening with both arms wide outstretched,\n",
      "hoping to catch anybody who tried to slip out with the sheep—\n",
      "did he really suppose I was going to be that stupid?\n",
      "By now I’d figured out just what I would have to do\n",
      "420\n",
      "to find an escape from death both for my companions\n",
      "and for myself: I’d thought of every trick and device\n",
      "that might save our lives: the threat was great and immediate.\n",
      "Now this, to my mind, looked the best of such plans:\n",
      "There were the rams, well-nourished and thickly fleeced,\n",
      "425\n",
      "fine strapping specimens, the wool on them violet-dark.\n",
      "These I silently tied together with pliable withies—\n",
      "on which the Kyklōps, bred in lawlessness, would sleep—\n",
      "taking three at a time: the middle one carried a man,\n",
      "while the ones on each flank gave my comrades protection:\n",
      "430\n",
      "thus each three sheep bore one person. As for myself,\n",
      "there was one special ram, the best in the whole flock:\n",
      "him I grasped by the back, curled up under his shaggy belly,\n",
      "and lay with my hands twisted into his marvelous fleece,\n",
      "holding on tight, with great patience, never relaxing.\n",
      "435\n",
      "And so, lamenting, we lay there, awaiting the bright dawn.\n",
      "“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "then the males of the flocks sallied out of the cave to pasture,\n",
      "while the ewes went bleating about their pens, unmilked,\n",
      "with bursting udders. Their master, in agonizing pain,\n",
      "440\n",
      "kept feeling along the backs of all his sheep\n",
      "as they stood before him. The booby never perceived\n",
      "that under his rich-fleeced sheep there were men tied on!\n",
      "Last of the flock the ram approached the entrance, heavy\n",
      "with his thick wool—and with me and my quick thinking!\n",
      "445\n",
      "Groping his back, the strong Polyphēmos addressed him, saying:\n",
      "‘Dear ram, why do you come thus through the cave, the very\n",
      "last of the flock? You used not to lag behind the others,\n",
      "but were always first out, to graze on the lushest pasture,\n",
      "striding ahead, the first to reach the flowing river,\n",
      "450\n",
      "the first that liked to head back into the sheepfold when\n",
      "evening came on. But now you’re the last of all. Are you mourning,\n",
      "maybe, your master’s lost eye, which a wicked man put out,\n",
      "he and his wretched fellows, when he’d doused my wits with wine—\n",
      "Nobody—who, I tell you, is not clear of destruction yet !\n",
      "455\n",
      "If you only could think as I do and had the power of speech\n",
      "to tell me where that creature is hiding away from my might,\n",
      "then would his brains, dashed out, lie scattered over the ground\n",
      "throughout the cave, and my spirit would be lightened\n",
      "of all the ills which that nothing-worth Nobody’s brought me.’\n",
      "460\n",
      "So saying, he let the ram go on out through the entrance.\n",
      "“When we’d moved on a little way from the cave and the enclosure,\n",
      "first I loosed myself from the ram, then untied my comrades.\n",
      "Quickly then we drove off the fat, smart-stepping sheep,\n",
      "glancing back all the time, until we reached our ship.\n",
      "465\n",
      "A welcome sight to our dear comrades were those of us\n",
      "who’d escaped death: for the others they started wailing.\n",
      "But this I stopped, with a silent upward jerk of the head\n",
      "that said ‘No’ to their weeping. I told them to throw on board,\n",
      "fast, all the fine-fleeced sheep, and to put to sea at once.\n",
      "470\n",
      "They came aboard quickly, each man to his rowlock, and seated\n",
      "in proper order they struck the grey brine with their oars,\n",
      "and when we had backed offshore as far as a man’s shout\n",
      "would carry, I called out to the Kyklōps with mocking words:\n",
      "‘Kyklōps, it was, then, no weakling whose comrades you planned,\n",
      "475\n",
      "by might and brute force, to eat in your hollow cave! In full\n",
      "were your evil deeds to rebound on your own head, vile wretch,\n",
      "who did not shrink from eating the guests in your house, for which\n",
      "Zeus and the other gods have exacted requital from you.’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and my words made him yet more angry at heart,\n",
      "480\n",
      "so that he wrenched off, and hurled at us, the peak of a lofty\n",
      "mountain, that fell just in front of our dark-prowed vessel,\n",
      "narrowly missing the end of the steering oar: the sea\n",
      "surged up under the falling rock’s impact, created\n",
      "a wave that carried our vessel straight back shoreward,\n",
      "485\n",
      "a heaving swell from the deep, aimed directly at the land.\n",
      "But I seized a very long pole in my hands and thrust us\n",
      "clear once more, and urgently signed to my comrades\n",
      "to row for dear life, and get us away from danger,\n",
      "gesturing with my head. They bent to their oars, and rowed.\n",
      "490\n",
      "But when, working hard at the sea, we’d doubled the distance,\n",
      "then I shouted again to the Kyklōps, though all around\n",
      "my comrades with calming arguments tried stop me:\n",
      "‘Stubborn wretch, why so set on infuriating this savage?\n",
      "Just now he flung some missile seaward, drove our vessel\n",
      "495\n",
      "back to land—indeed, we thought we were done for!\n",
      "If he’d heard any one of us making a sound, or shouting,\n",
      "he’d have broken our heads as well as the ship’s timbers\n",
      "with a cast of some sharp glinting boulder, so mighty his arm!’\n",
      "“Thus they spoke, but could not shift my great-hearted spirit,\n",
      "500\n",
      "and I answered him back, irate and resentful at heart:\n",
      "‘Kyklōps, if any mortal, of all mankind, should ask you\n",
      "about your eye’s unseemly blindness, tell them it was\n",
      "Odysseus, sacker of cities, who destroyed your eyesight:\n",
      "Laërtēs’ son, who calls Ithákē his home.’\n",
      "“So I spoke,\n",
      "505\n",
      "and he groaned aloud, and then responded to me, saying:\n",
      "‘Alas, that ancient prophecy has indeed come true for me!\n",
      "There once was a prophet here, a great gentleman too—\n",
      "Tēlemos, Eurymos’ son, a man unmatched in seercraft,\n",
      "who grew old as a diviner among the Kyklōpes: he\n",
      "510\n",
      "told me that all these things would happen in time to come,\n",
      "that by Odysseus’ hands I’d be deprived of my sight.\n",
      "But I always thought it would be some tall and handsome\n",
      "hero who’d show up here, endowed with mighty strength:\n",
      "But in fact it’s this puny, no-account weakling who’s\n",
      "515\n",
      "deprived me of eyesight after fuddling my wits with wine!\n",
      "Come back here, Odysseus, and let me offer you guest-gifts,\n",
      "and urge the famed Earth-Shaker to grant you conveyance home,\n",
      "for I am his son, and he avows that he’s my father.\n",
      "He himself, if he so chooses, will heal me—he, and none other,\n",
      "520\n",
      "whether one of the blessed gods or some mortal human.’\n",
      "“So he spoke, and I answered him, saying: ‘How I wish\n",
      "I had the power to strip you of breath and life, and send you\n",
      "down to the realm of Hadēs, as surely as no one\n",
      "will heal your eye, not even the Earth-Shaker himself.’\n",
      "525\n",
      "“So I spoke, and he then prayed to the lord Poseidōn,\n",
      "reaching out both his hands to the starry heavens: ‘Hear me,\n",
      "Poseidōn, dark-haired Earth-Shaker, if I am truly\n",
      "your son, if you avow yourself my father! Grant\n",

      "They opened the bag, and all the winds rushed out—\n",
      "a storm wind instantly seized them, bore them seaward\n",
      "weeping, away from their native land; and I,\n",

      "50\n",
      "whether to plunge overboard, and perish in the deep,\n",
      "or to endure in silence, remain among the living.\n",
      "I held on and stayed, head covered, lying there\n",

      "55\n",

      "But when we’d gotten a taste of food and drink,\n",
      "then I, taking with me a herald and one companion,\n",
      "made my way to Aiolos’ famed abode, and found him\n",
      "60\n",
      "at dinner, along with his wife and children. We entered\n",
      "his house, and sat by the doorposts, at the threshold.\n",
      "They were amazed to see us, and questioned us, saying:\n",
      "‘Why are you here, Odysseus? What mean god assailed you?\n",
      "We dispatched you with all kindness, to ensure you’d come\n",
      "65\n",
      "safely to home and country, or wherever you wanted.’\n",
      "“So they spoke; and, grieving at heart, I then explained to them:\n",

      "slumber! My friends, help me now: you have the power.’\n",
      "“So I spoke, addressing them with conciliatory words;\n",
      "70\n",
      "but they remained silent. Then their father made this response:\n",
      "‘Leave this island at once, most abject of living creatures!\n",
      "It’s not proper for me to aid or provide conveyance\n",
      "to a man whom the blessed gods abominate! Begone!\n",
      "You come here as one marked out by divine hostility!’\n",
      "75\n",
      "“That said, he dismissed me, groaning heavily, from his domain.\n",
      "So from there we pushed on still further, grieving at heart,\n",
      "the men’s spirit worn down by the hardship of rowing, since,\n",
      "due to our folly, we no longer had a good wind behind us.\n",
      "For six more days, then, we voyaged on, day and night,\n",
      "80\n",
      "and on the seventh we reached the steep citadel of Lamos,1\n",
      "Laistrygonian Tēlepylos, where shepherd greets shepherd\n",
      "one driving his flock back home, out to pasture the other.\n",
      "There a man that needed no sleep could earn a double wage,2\n",
      "by both herding cattle, and tending white sheep, so close\n",
      "85\n",
      "do the paths of the night and the day run on together.\n",
      "When we reached the fine harbor there—a sheer cliff face\n",
      "ran all the way round it from side to side, while two\n",
      "projecting headlands, confronting each another, loomed large\n",
      "at the mouth, leaving only a restricted entrance—\n",
      "90\n",
      "then all the rest went on in with their well-curved vessels.\n",
      "and moored them there, snug inside the hollow harbor,\n",
      "packed side by side, for no wave ever stirred there,\n",
      "either great or small; all around was a bright calm.\n",
      "But I alone held my black ship back outside\n",
      "95\n",
      "at the furthest edge, hitched my cables to a rock;\n",
      "then climbed to a rugged lookout point, and stood there.\n",
      "Looking round, I saw no cattle, no human activity, nothing\n",
      "except for a trace of smoke drifting skyward from the earth.\n",
      "So I then sent out some comrades to go ahead and discover\n",
      "100\n",
      "what kind of men, among earth’s bread-eaters, dwelt here:\n",
      "two men I chose, and a third to go with them as herald.\n",
      "They went ashore and followed a beaten track, by which\n",
      "wagons would haul down wood to the city from the hilltops.\n",
      "Outside the city they met a girl who was drawing water—\n",
      "105\n",
      "the strapping daughter, this, of a certain Laistrygonian,\n",
      "Antiphatēs: she’d come down to the fair-flowing spring,\n",
      "Artakiē, from which they carried their water into town.\n",
      "So they approached her, spoke to her, asked her questions—\n",
      "Who was king of these people, and who were his subjects?\n",
      "110\n",
      "She promptly showed them her father’s high-roofed house.\n",
      "When they entered this famed domain, they found his wife at home,\n",
      "huge as a mountain peak, and were horrified by her.\n",
      "She at once summoned famous Antiphatēs, her husband,\n",
      "from assembly: he devised a miserable fate for them.\n",
      "115\n",
      "One of my comrades he grabbed, prepared him for dinner,\n",
      "But the other two took to their heels, got away to the ships.\n",
      "Then he raised a cry through the city, and when they heard it\n",
      "the powerful Laistrygonians thronged in from all around,\n",
      "thousands of them, resembling not human beings, but Giants!\n",
      "120\n",
      "From the cliffs with boulders—each one a man-sized load—\n",
      "they showered us: a ghastly sound rose up from the ships\n",
      "of men dying and tinber shattering. They speared them\n",
      "like fishes, carried them off to have as their gruesome meal.\n",
      "But while they were murdering those inside the deep harbor,\n",
      "125\n",
      "I meanwhile, drawing the sharp sword from by my thigh\n",
      "with it cut the stern cables of my dark-prowed vessel,\n",
      "and quickly called to my comrades, urging, commanding them\n",
      "to row for dear life, get us clear of disaster. They all,\n",
      "in terror of death ripped up the salt spume with their oar blades.\n",
      "130\n",
      "Ah, the joy of escaping those sheer cliffs, getting out to sea—\n",
      "for my ship alone: all the rest now perished as they lay there.\n",
      "“So we sailed on from there, lamenting at heart, but glad\n",
      "at having escaped from death, though we’d lost our comrades;\n",
      "and we came to the isle of Aiaia, that was the home\n",
      "135\n",
      "of fair-tressed Kirkē, dread goddess of mortal speech—\n",
      "full sister was she to the evil-minded Aiētēs,\n",
      "and both were begotten by Hēlios, bringer of light,\n",
      "on Persē, their mother, whom Ocean had as his daughter.\n",
      "There we put in to land with our ship, and silently steered her\n",
      "140\n",
      "into a well-sheltered harbor, with some god guiding us.\n",
      "Then, after disembarking, we lay there two days and nights\n",
      "eating our hearts with out with fatigue and sorrow;\n",
      "But when fair-tressed Dawn ushered in the third day, then\n",
      "I took my spear and my keen-edged sword, and quickly\n",
      "145\n",
      "climbed on up from the ship to a point with a good view\n",
      "in my search for signs of field work or of human voices.\n",
      "I got to a rocky outcrop, a lookout station, and stood there,\n",
      "and glimpsed smoke wavering up from the wide-wayed earth\n",
      "out of Kirkē’s dwelling, through dense coppices and leafage.\n",
      "150\n",
      "So then I pondered, in my mind and spirit, whether—\n",
      "having seen fire and smoke—I should go and find out more;\n",
      "and as I reflected, it struck me that this was the best course:\n",
      "to go back to my swift ship first, and to the seashore,\n",
      "give my comrades a meal, but then send them to investigate.\n",
      "155\n",
      "But as I went, and came close to my well-curved vessel,\n",
      "then, too, some god, seeing me alone, felt pity,\n",
      "and sent, right into my path, a huge high-antlered stag\n",
      "on his way from his forest range to drink at the river,\n",
      "since the sun’s strong heat had got to him. As he emerged,\n",
      "160\n",
      "I speared him, in mid-back, piercing his spine: the bronze\n",
      "spear now transfixed him, he uttered a dying cry\n",
      "and collapsed in the dust. The spirit fled from him. Then,\n",
      "one foot on his back, I tugged the bronze spear out\n",
      "from the wound, left the carcass there on the ground,\n",
      "165\n",
      "while I plucked still-growing stems and osiers, wove them\n",
      "into a fathom-long rope, well twisted at either end,\n",
      "and, tying the feet of this monstrous beast together,\n",
      "slung it across my back, and went on to the black ship\n",
      "leaning upon my spear, since no way could I support it\n",
      "170\n",
      "with one hand upon my shoulder, so huge a brute it was.\n",
      "I dumped it in front of the ship, and spoke encouraging words\n",
      "to my comrades, addressing each individual in turn:\n",
      "‘Not yet, friends, for all our grief, shall we go down\n",
      "to Hades’ realm before our destined day arrives!\n",
      "175\n",
      "So come, while there’s still food and drink in our swift ship\n",
      "Let’s think about eating, not waste away from hunger!’\n",
      "“So I spoke: they at once paid heed to my words, uncovered\n",
      "their faces,3 and, on that shore by the unharvested sea,\n",
      "stared in awe at the stag: a huge beast it was indeed.\n",
      "180\n",
      "But when they’d feasted their eyes upon this spectacle\n",
      "they washed their hands and made ready a truly splendid feast.\n",
      "“So the whole long day until the going down of the sun\n",
      "we sat feasting on meat in abundance, drinking sweet wine;\n",
      "but when the sun had set and darkness came on\n",
      "185\n",
      "then we lay down and slept along the line of the shore.\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "I called an assembly and then addressed them all, declaring:\n",
      "‘Heed what I say, my comrades, for all your grim suffering!\n",
      "Dear friends, we don’t know where darkness lies, or dawn,\n",
      "190\n",
      "or where the sun that brings light to mortals goes down\n",
      "under the earth, or rises; but let us take thought, quickly:\n",
      "Is there any course open to us? Myself, I do not think so.\n",
      "I climbed to a rugged lookout point and surveyed\n",
      "the island. The boundless deep encircles it all around.\n",
      "195\n",
      "It’s low-lying land: I did see smoke, in the middle,\n",
      "wavering up through dense coppices and leafage.’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and their inner spirit was broken, as they\n",
      "recalled the deeds of Antiphatēs, the Laistrygonian,\n",
      "and of the Kyklōps, that gross-spirited man-eater.\n",
      "200\n",
      "They wept aloud and shed thick-flowing tears,\n",
      "but all their lamenting accomplished nothing for them.\n",
      "“I divided my well-greaved comrades into two groups,\n",
      "chose a leader for each of them: I myself took command\n",
      "of one, put godlike Eurylochos in charge of the other.\n",
      "205\n",
      "Next, at once, we shook lots in a bronze helmet,\n",
      "and out leapt the lot of great-hearted Eurylochos.\n",
      "So he set off, and took with him twenty-two comrades,\n",
      "all in tears; and the ones left behind were lamenting too.\n",
      "“They found, in a woodland glen, the house of Kirkē, built\n",
      "210\n",
      "of polished stone, and set in a space with a wide vista.\n",
      "Prowling around it were mountain wolves and lions\n",
      "that she had enchanted by feeding them evil drugs.\n",
      "These beasts did not rush to attack my men, but instead\n",
      "fawned round them, rearing, swishing their long tails.\n",
      "215\n",
      "In the way that dogs, when their master’s coming from dinner,\n",
      "fawn round him, since he always has some tasty tit-bit for them,\n",
      "so round my men now fawned these strong-clawed wolves\n",
      "and lions. The men were afraid on seeing such scary monsters.\n",
      "So there they stood in the sweet-haired goddess’ forecourt\n",
      "220\n",
      "and heard Kirkē singing inside in an enchanting voice\n",
      "as she went to and fro, weaving a great immortal web—\n",
      "fine work, exquisite, charming, as is that of all goddesses.\n",
      "First to find words was Politēs, leader of men, the dearest\n",
      "to me of all my comrades, and the most devoted:\n",
      "225\n",
      "‘Friends, there’s some lady inside, going to and fro at the loom\n",
      "and singing so sweetly that the whole floor echoes round—\n",
      "goddess or woman, let’s call out to her!’\n",
      "“So he spoke,\n",
      "and they all clamored, calling out to her. She at once\n",
      "threw open the shining doors, came out herself,\n",
      "230\n",
      "and invited them in. They all, in their innocence, followed,\n",
      "except for Eurylochos: he, suspecting a trap, hung back.\n",
      "She escorted them in, sat them down on chairs and benches,\n",
      "and offered them barley meal, cheese, and pale yellow honey\n",
      "mixed with Pramnian wine; but she added to this mixture\n",
      "235\n",
      "baneful drugs to destroy their memory of their homeland.\n",
      "When she’d given it them and they’d swallowed it, then at once\n",
      "she struck them with her wand, and shut them away in sties:\n",
      "they now all had pigs’ heads, pigs’ voices, and pigs’ bristles,\n",
      "pigs’ bodies too; but their minds remained unchanged.\n",
      "240\n",
      "So they were penned in, weeping; and Kirkē threw them\n",
      "oak nuts to eat, acorns, the fruit of the cornel tree—\n",
      "such food as swine that sleep on the ground will feed on.\n",
      "“Now Eurylochos came straight back to our swift black ship\n",
      "to tell us the news of his comrades and their unkind fate.\n",
      "245\n",
      "But not one word could he utter, much though he longed to,\n",
      "so stricken with great distress was he in his heart; his eyes\n",
      "were brimming with tears, his spirit brooded on lamentation.\n",
      "Only after we questioned him, in our amazement, did he\n",
      "then inform us about the fate of his other comrades:\n",
      "250\n",
      "‘We went through the wood as you told us, noble Odysseus,\n",
      "and found, in a glen, a splendid house, constructed\n",
      "of polished stone, and set in a space with a wide vista.\n",
      "Someone inside was going to and fro at a great web, singing\n",
      "sweetly, goddess or woman. We all called out to her.\n",
      "255\n",
      "She at once threw open the shining doors, emerged,\n",
      "and invited us in. The rest, in their innocence, followed.\n",
      "But I held back, suspecting a trap, and they then\n",
      "vanished together—not one of them ever returned,\n",
      "though I sat around long enough, watching out for them.’\n",
      "260\n",
      "“So he spoke. I now slung my silver-studded sword—\n",
      "large, of bronze—from my shoulders, strapped on my bow\n",
      "and quiver, told him to lead me back the way he’d come.\n",
      "But he clutched at my knees with both hands, besought me, wept,\n",
      "then addressed me tearfully with winged words, saying: ‘Don’t\n",
      "265\n",
      "make me go back, Zeus’ nursling! Let me stay here!\n",
      "I know you’ll never come back yourself, or rescue\n",
      "any of your lost comrades! Let’s get out now, with those\n",
      "that are here—we still may escape the day of doom!’\n",
      "“So he spoke;\n",
      "and I responded to him, saying: ‘Eurylochos you,\n",

      "yourself can remain here, right where you are, quite safe,\n",
      "eating and drinking beside the black hollow ship; but go\n",
      "I myself must; a most powerful need is upon me.’\n",
      "“So saying, I went my way, up from the ship and the sea.\n",
      "I’d passed through the sacred glens, and was near the great\n",
      "275\n",
      "house of Kirkē, that expert in the use of countless drugs,\n",
      "when Hermēs met me, god of the golden wand,\n",
      "on my way to the house, in the likeness of a young man\n",
      "with the first down on his face, when the charm of youth\n",
      "is greatest. He took my hand, and said: ‘Where are you off to\n",
      "280\n",
      "again, you hapless man, in the highlands, all alone,\n",
      "and ignorant of the country? Your comrades in Kirkē’s house\n",
      "are caged up as pigs in her imprisoning sties. Are you\n",
      "coming here to release them? I tell you, you yourself\n",
      "will never escape, you’ll end up caught like the rest!\n",
      "285\n",
      "But see now, I shall free you from harm, and save you—\n",
      "Here, take this potent herb, have it with you when you go\n",
      "to Kirkē’s house: it’ll keep the evil day from your head!\n",
      "And I’ll tell you all Kirkē’s malevolent wiles: she’ll make you\n",
      "a mixed posset,4 adding in drugs along with the foodstuff.\n",
      "290\n",
      "Yet not even so will she contrive to bewitch you: the potent\n",
      "herb that I’ll give you won’t let her. And I’ll tell you all\n",
      "you must do. When Kirkē strikes you with her long wand,\n",
      "draw your sharp sword from beside your thigh, as though\n",
      "with intent kill her. Then she, overcome by terror,\n",
      "295\n",
      "will invite you to bed down with her, make love together.\n",
      "You must not, at this point, refuse the bed of the goddess\n",
      "if you want her to free your comrades and provide for you;\n",
      "but make her swear a great oath by the blessed gods\n",
      "to plan no more nasty trouble against your person,\n",
      "300\n",
      "lest when she has you naked she’ll weaken and unman you.’\n",
      "“So saying, the slayer of Argos gave me the herb,\n",
      "pulling it out of the ground, and showed me its nature.\n",
      "At its root it was black, but its flower was white as milk:\n",
      "Moly is what the gods call it: it’s hard for mortal men\n",
      "305\n",
      "to dig up; but the gods can do whatever they’ve a mind to.\n",
      "“Hermēs now departed to lofty Olympos, going\n",
      "up through the tree-clad island, while I made my way\n",
      "to Kirkē’s house, my heart in a turmoil as I went.\n",
      "I stood in the forecourt of the fine-tressed goddess\n",
      "310\n",
      "and standing there called to her. The goddess heard my voice,\n",
      "at once came out, flung open the shining doors\n",
      "and invited me in. Much troubled at heart, I entered.\n",
      "She led me in and seated me on a silver-studded chair—\n",
      "beautiful, finely crafted, with a footstool for my feet.\n",
      "315\n",
      "Then she mixed me a posset in a golden cup,\n",
      "but slipped a drug into it, with malevolence in her heart.\n",
      "When she gave it to me, and I drank it, yet was not bewitched,\n",
      "she struck me with her wand, and had this word for me, saying:\n",
      "‘Off to the sty with you! Lie there with your other comrades!’\n",
      "320\n",
      "“So she spoke. I drew the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\n",
      "and charged at Kirkē, as though with intent to kill her.\n",
      "She gave a loud scream, slipped under my charge, embraced\n",
      "my knees, and, sobbing, addressed me with winged words, saying:\n",
      "‘Who are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\n",
      "325\n",
      "I’m amazed that you drank my drug and were not bewitched!\n",
      "No other man, ever, has failed to succumb to this drug\n",
      "once he’d drunk it, once it had passed the barrier of his teeth!\n",
      "Truly, the mind in your breast is proof against all enchantment.\n",
      "You must be resourceful Odysseus, who—so the slayer of Argos,\n",
      "330\n",
      "he of the golden wand, always told me—would visit here\n",
      "in his swift black ship, on his way back home from Troy!\n",
      "So come, sheath your sword, let the two of us now go up\n",
      "into my bed, and by mingling there together\n",
      "in the passion of love, find trust, each one in the other.’\n",
      "335\n",
      "“So she spoke; but I answered her thus, with a question, saying:\n",
      "‘Kirkē, how can you tell me to come and make love with you,\n",
      "when you’ve turned my comrades to swine, right here in your halls,\n",
      "and now you have me here, with malign intent you want me\n",
      "to go up into your chamber and your bed, so that when\n",
      "340\n",
      "you have me naked you can weaken and unman me?\n",
      "Never would I agree to come anywhere near your bed\n",
      "unless you, goddess, were to swear me a mighty oath\n",
      "that you’d plan no more malicious trouble against my person.’\n",
      "“So I spoke. She at once swore the oath as I requested.\n",
      "345\n",
      "But not till she’d sworn, and completed the oath in full,\n",
      "would I agree to go up into Kirkē’s sumptuous bed.\n",
      "Meanwhile her handmaids were busy around the halls—\n",
      "four of them, those who did all the housework in her home:\n",
      "nymphs, these, daughters of the springs and the groves,\n",
      "350\n",
      "of the sacred rivers that flow to their outfall by the sea.\n",
      "One was hanging fine purple cloths on the headrests\n",
      "of chairs and under them spreading white linen foot mats;\n",
      "another was setting up silver tables beside the chairs\n",
      "and arranging golden baskets upon them; the third\n",
      "355\n",
      "of these serving women was mixing sweet mind-honeying\n",
      "wine in a silver bowl and setting out golden goblets.\n",
      "The fourth had fetched in water and lit a blazing fire\n",
      "beneath a great cauldron: the water was getting hot.\n",
      "When it reached boiling point in the bright bronze vessel,\n",
      "360\n",
      "she got me into a bath, sluiced me down from the cauldron,\n",
      "mixing hot and cold to my taste, bathing head and shoulders\n",
      "to ease from my limbs their heart-crushing weariness.\n",
      "After she’d bathed me, and massaged me with rich oil,\n",
      "she provided me with a splendid mantle and tunic,\n",
      "365\n",
      "brought me back, and seated me on a silver-studded chair—\n",
      "elegant, finely wrought—with a footstool for my feet.\n",
      "A maid brought hand-washing water in a beautiful golden\n",
      "pitcher and poured it into a silver basin for me\n",
      "to wash with and drew up beside me a polished table.\n",
      "370\n",
      "The respected housekeeper now set bread beside me,\n",
      "with many side dishes, giving freely of her supplies.\n",
      "Then she told me to eat, but I was not so minded:\n",
      "I sat brooding on other things: my heart sensed trouble.\n",
      "“Now when Kirkē saw me thus sitting, not reaching out\n",
      "375\n",
      "for food, and overmastered by deep-felt distress, she came\n",
      "and stood close beside me, addressed me with winged words, saying:\n",
      "‘Odysseus, why are you sitting there like some voiceless person,\n",
      "eating your heart out, touching neither food nor drink?\n",
      "Do you maybe anticipate some new trick? You don’t need\n",
      "380\n",
      "to be afraid: I’ve already sworn that powerful oath.’\n",
      "“So she spoke:\n",
      "but to her I then responded, saying: ‘Kirkē, tell me,\n",
      "what kind of man is it, in his right mind, could bear\n",
      "to taste food or drink before he’d secured freedom\n",
      "for his comrades, had seen them with his own eyes? If you\n",
      "385\n",
      "really mean it when you tell me to eat and drink, then free them!\n",
      "And let me set eyes myself on these, my trusty comrades.’\n",
      "“So I spoke. Kirkē now made her way out through the hall,\n",
      "wand in hand, flung open the doors of the sty, and drove\n",
      "my men out, embodied as hogs some nine years old.\n",
      "390\n",
      "They stood there before her, and she went in among them,\n",
      "anointing each one with a different magic salve, so that\n",
      "the bristles earlier grown there by the deadly drug\n",
      "that the lady Kirkē had given them now sloughed off their limbs:\n",
      "men they became again, more youthful than previously,\n",
      "395\n",
      "a great deal more handsome, much taller in their carriage.\n",
      "They recognized me: each one of them clung to my hands.\n",
      "A yearning for lamentation came on us all, and the house\n",
      "echoed terribly round us: the goddess herself felt pity.\n",
      "“Then she, bright among goddesses, approached me and said:\n",
      "400\n",
      "‘Son of Laërtēs, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "go down now to your swift ship, there on the seashore.\n",
      "First thing of all, haul your vessel high up upon the beach,\n",
      "then store all your goods and equipment in the caves,\n",
      "then come back yourself and bring your trusty comrades.’\n",
      "405\n",
      "“So she spoke, and my proud spirit was persuaded.\n",
      "I made my way down to the swift ship and the seashore,\n",
      "and there by the swift ship I found my trusty comrades\n",
      "lamenting piteously and shredding big tears. As country\n",
      "calves will come frisking about a herd of cows\n",
      "410\n",
      "on their way back to the dung yard, replete with fodder—\n",
      "in a mass they confront them, the pens no longer contain them,\n",
      "and endlessly lowing they keep scampering round\n",
      "their mothers—so these men, when they set eyes upon me,\n",
      "thronged round me weeping: it seemed to them in their hearts\n",
      "415\n",
      "as though they’d got back to their homeland, to the actual\n",
      "township of rugged Ithákē where they were born and bred.\n",
      "Lamenting now they addressed me with winged words, saying:\n",
      "‘We’re as delighted, Zeus’ nursling, by your return, as if\n",
      "we’d got back home to Ithákē, to our native country!\n",
      "420\n",
      "But come now, tell us the fate of our other companions.’\n",
      "“So they spoke, and I gave them a reassuring response:\n",
      "‘First thing of all, haul our vessel high up upon the beach,\n",
      "then store all our goods and equipment in the caves.\n",
      "That done, you—all of you—come quickly along with me\n",
      "425\n",
      "to the sacred halls of Kirkē, where you’ll see your comrades\n",
      "eating and drinking, from a never-failing abundance.’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and they were quick to obey my instructions.\n",
      "Only Eurylochos tried to hold back all our comrades,\n",
      "and addressed them with winged words, saying: ‘You wretched\n",
      "430\n",
      "creatures, where are we going? Why long for these troubles,\n",
      "when going down into Kirkē’s domain will surely\n",
      "transform each one of us into swine or wolves or lions,\n",
      "condemned, under obligation, to guard her great abode?\n",
      "That’s how the Kyklōps acted when our comrades entered\n",
      "435\n",
      "his farmstead and headstrong Odysseus went in with them:\n",
      "it was through this man’s recklessness that they too perished.’\n",
      "“So he spoke; I debated in my mind then whether I should\n",
      "unsheathe the long sword from beside my sturdy thigh,\n",
      "and cut off his head with it, lay him low, although\n",
      "440\n",
      "close kin by marriage he was to me; but my comrades\n",
      "one after another with honey-sweet words restrained me:\n",
      "‘Scion of Zeus, give the order, and we’ll leave this man here\n",
      "to stay by the ship and to guard it; but as for us,\n",
      "what we want is for you to lead us to Kirkē’s sacred abode.’\n",
      "445\n",
      "“So saying, they started off then, up from the ship and the sea;\n",
      "nor was Eurylochos left behind by the hollow ship,\n",
      "but came with the rest of us, fearing my strong reproof.\n",
      "“Meanwhile, back in her house, Kirkē with loving care\n",
      "bathed the rest of my comrades, massaged them with rich oil,\n",
      "450\n",
      "and dressed them up in fine wool mantles and tunics;\n",
      "we found them all having a good dinner there in her halls.\n",
      "But when my men saw and recognized one another,\n",
      "they wept and lamented: the house reechoed around them.\n",
      "Then she, bright among goddesses, approached me and said:\n",
      "455\n",
      "‘Son of Laërtēs, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "no longer need you all raise this loud lament! I too know\n",
      "the sum of the troubles you suffered out on the fish-rich deep\n",
      "and every wrong that’s been done you by hostile men on land.\n",
      "But come now, eat your food and drink your wine, until\n",
      "460\n",
      "you once more recover that spirit you had in your breasts\n",
      "to begin with when you set out from your native land\n",
      "of rugged Ithákē—but now you’re worn and dispirited,\n",
      "forever recalling your rough wandering, nor has your heart\n",
      "known any joy, since indeed you’ve suffered greatly.’\n",
      "465\n",
      "“So she spoke, and our proud spirits consented,\n",
      "and day after day, for the course of a whole year\n",
      "we sat there feasting on plentiful meat and wine.\n",
      "but when a year had passed, as the turning seasons\n",
      "of the months went by, and the long days came to an end,\n",
      "470\n",
      "then my trusty companions assailed me with their complaints:\n",
      "‘Are you out of your mind? High time to think of your homeland\n",
      "if it’s truly your destiny to be saved and to return\n",
      "to your high-roofed house and to your own native country.’\n",
      "“So they spoke, and my proud spirit consented.\n",
      "475\n",
      "So all day long until the setting of the sun\n",
      "we sat there feasting on plentiful meat and sweet wine;\n",
      "but when the sun went down and darkness came on,\n",
      "and they retired to sleep along the shadowy halls,\n",
      "then I myself went up into Kirkē’s sumptuous bed\n",
      "480\n",
      "and clasped her knees in entreaty. The goddess heard\n",
      "and listened. I addressed her with winged words, saying:\n",
      "‘Kirkē, fulfill for me now the promise you made, that you’d\n",
      "convey me home: my spirit’s eager to be on its way,\n",
      "likewise the rest of my comrades, who nag me to death\n",
      "485\n",
      "as they grieve around me, whenever you’re somewhere else.’\n",
      "“So I spoke. Bright among goddesses, she at once replied:\n",
      "‘Son of Laërtēs, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "you all need stay in my house no longer against your will;\n",
      "but there is another journey you must accomplish first:\n",
      "490\n",
      "you must go to the realm of Hādēs and dread Persephonē,\n",
      "to consult the ghostly spirit of Thēban Teirēsias,\n",
      "blind seer, whose reasoning mind remains intact,\n",
      "since on him alone, when dead, Persephonē bestowed\n",
      "full mental powers: the rest are only flitting shadows.’\n",
      "495\n",
      "“So she spoke. But the spirit within me was shattered:\n",
      "I wept as I sat on the bed, and my heart no longer\n",
      "had any desire to live, to behold the sunlight.\n",
      "But when I’d had my fill of weeping and agonizing,\n",
      "I found the words to reply with, and addressed her, saying:\n",
      "500\n",
      "‘Kirkē, who will serve as our guide upon this journey?\n",
      "No one yet in a black ship has ever voyaged to Hādēs.’\n",
      "“So I spoke. She, bright among goddesses, at once replied:\n",
      "‘Son of Laërtēs, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "don’t worry about installing a pilot aboard your ship—\n",
      "505\n",
      "Just set up your mast, spread your white sail, and then\n",
      "sit down, and let the north wind carry you onward!\n",
      "But when in your ship you’ve traversed the stream of Ocean,\n",
      "and come to a wooded shore and the groves of Persephonē,\n",
      "with their tall poplars, and willows that shed their fruit,\n",
      "510\n",
      "there beach your vessel, close by deep-eddying Ocean,\n",
      "and yourself go on to the dank domain of Hadēs. There\n",
      "it is that into Acherōn Pyriphlegethōn flows,\n",
      "and Kōkytos, that branches off from the waters of Styx:5\n",
      "a rock marks the confluence of these two loud rivers.\n",
      "515\n",
      "Go close in there, hero, exactly as I instruct you,\n",
      "and dig out a pit, about a cubit deep and wide,\n",
      "and around it pour a libation to all the dead—\n",
      "first with milk and honey, then with sweet wine,\n",
      "and thirdly with water: sprinkle white barley on it,\n",
      "520\n",
      "and entreat the weak heads of the dead with many vows—\n",
      "that when you’re back on Ithákē you’ll sacrifice the best\n",
      "barren heifer in your domain, load the pyre with good things,\n",
      "and, just for Teirēsias, you’ll make a sacrifice\n",
      "of an all-black ram, the finest one in your flocks.\n",
      "525\n",
      "Then, when you’ve supplicated the famous tribes of the dead,\n",
      "you must slaughter a ram and a black ewe, making them face\n",
      "toward Erebos, while you turn your back on them, reach out\n",
      "to the streams of the river. This is the place where many\n",
      "ghosts of those who have perished will now gather.\n",
      "530\n",
      "At that point arouse your comrades, and command them\n",
      "to take the sheep that lie there, slain by the ruthless bronze,\n",
      "and flay and burn them, along with prayers to the gods—\n",
      "strong Hadēs and dread Persephonē. You yourself,\n",
      "drawing the keen-edged sword from beside your thigh,\n",
      "535\n",
      "must sit there, and not allow the weak heads of the dead\n",
      "to get near the blood until you’ve questioned Teirēsias.\n",
      "The seer will then quickly approach you, leader of men:\n",
      "He will show you your route, explain your journey’s stages,\n",
      "your homecoming, how you’re to traverse the fish-rich deep.’\n",
      "540\n",
      "“So she spoke; and at once the golden-throned Dawn arose.\n",
      "She gave me a mantle to wear, and a tunic; and she, the nymph,\n",
      "dressed herself in a long white robe, made of finely\n",
      "woven and beautiful stuff, and around her waist\n",
      "knotted a fine golden sash, set a veil on her head.\n",
      "545\n",

      "in search of cool air, being heavy with wine, on the roof.\n",
      "555\n",

      "fell headlong off the roof: his neck was snapped through\n",
      "at the spine, and his ghost went down to Hadēs’ realm.\n",

      "5\n",
      "in the wake of our dark-prowed vessel a following breeze\n",
      "that filled our sail, a trusty companion, was sent us\n",
      "by fair-tressed Kirkē, dread goddess of mortal speech.\n",
      "So when we’d secured the tackle throughout the ship we then\n",
      "sat down, leaving wind and steersman to keep her on her course.\n",
      "10\n",
      "All day long her sail spread taut as she sheared through the deep,\n",
      "till the sun went down and all the ways were in shadow.\n",
      "She came to the boundary marked by deep-flowing Ocean,\n",
      "where are the land and settlement of the Kimmerians,\n",
      "enveloped in mist and cloud: upon them never\n",
      "15\n",
      "does the bright-gleaming sun look down with his rays,\n",
      "either while he’s climbing into the starry heavens\n",
      "or when he turns back again from heaven to earth,\n",
      "but deathly night’s spread out over hapless mortals.\n",
      "“There we now came, and beached our ship. Unloading\n",
      "20\n",
      "the sheep, we made our way beside the stream of Ocean\n",
      "until we reached the place of which Kirkē had told us.\n",
      "There Perimēdēs and Eurylochos held the victims,\n",
      "while I unsheathed the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\n",
      "and dug out a pit, about a cubit deep and wide,\n",
      "25\n",
      "and around it poured a libation to all the dead—\n",
      "first with milk and honey, then with sweet wine,\n",
      "and thirdly with water: I sprinkled white barley in it,\n",
      "besought the weak heads of the dead with many vows—\n",
      "that when I was back on Ithákē I’d sacrifice the best\n",
      "30\n",
      "barren heifer in my domain, load the pyre with good things,\n",
      "and, for Teirēsias only, would offer a sacrifice\n",
      "of an all-black ram, the finest one in my flocks.\n",
      "Then, when with vows and prayers I’d made my entreaties\n",
      "to the tribes of the dead, I took the sheep, cut their throats\n",
      "35\n",
      "over the pit. The dark blood flowed, there came up out\n",
      "from Erebos1 the shades of corpses dead and buried:\n",
      "brides, still-unmarried youths, toil-worn old men,\n",
      "tender young girls, their hearts still new to sorrow,\n",
      "and many with wounds inflicted by bronze-tipped spears,\n",
      "40\n",
      "men slain while fighting, still in their bloodstained armor—\n",
      "many crowding around the pit from every quarter\n",
      "with an eerie clamor. Pale fear took possession of me.\n",
      "But still I called my companions, gave them orders to take\n",
      "the sheep that lay there, slain by the ruthless bronze,\n",
      "45\n",
      "and flay and burn them, along with prayers to the gods—\n",
      "strong Hadēs and holy Persephonē. I myself,\n",
      "unsheathing the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\n",
      "sat there, and would not allow the weak heads of the dead\n",
      "to come near the blood until I’d questioned Teirēsias.\n",
      "50\n",
      "“The first shade to come was that of my comrade Elpēnōr.\n",
      "Not yet had he been interred beneath the wide-traveled earth,\n",
      "for we’d left his body behind in Kirkē’s hall, unwept\n",
      "and unburied, since this other business was what now drove us.\n",
      "On seeing him I wept, and my heart felt pity for him,\n",
      "55\n",
      "and speaking with winged words, I addressed him, saying:\n",
      "‘Elpēnōr, how did you come here through the murky darkness?\n",
      "You traveled faster on foot than I in my black ship.’\n",
      "“So I spoke. He groaned, and responded to me, saying:\n",
      "‘Son of Laërtēs, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "60\n",
      "some god’s ill-will undid me—that, and too much wine!\n",
      "When I lay down to sleep in Kirkē’s house I forgot\n",
      "I must make my way back down by the long ladder,\n",
      "so fell headlong off the roof: my neck was snapped through\n",
      "at the spine; my shade went down to Hadēs’ realm.\n",
      "65\n",
      "Now I beseech you, by those left behind who are not here,\n",
      "by your wife, by the father who cared for you as an infant,\n",
      "by Tēlemachos, whom you left as the sole child in your halls—\n",
      "I know when you go on from here, leave the realm of Hadēs,\n",
      "you’ll put in, with your well-built ship, at the isle of Aiaia.\n",
      "70\n",
      "It’s there, my lord, that I need your remembrance most—\n",
      "Don’t abandon me there unwept, unburied, lest I\n",
      "become the occasion of some god’s wrath against you!\n",
      "Burn me there, I beg you, with such armor as I possess,\n",
      "and heap me a burial mound by the shore of the grey sea,\n",
      "75\n",
      "for those yet unborn to learn of an unfortunate man.\n",
      "Do this for me, and set on my tomb the oar\n",
      "with which I rowed, when alive, among my comrades.’\n",
      "“So he spoke, and I then answered him, saying: ‘All this,\n",
      "unhappy man, I’ll most surely carry out on your behalf.’\n",
      "80\n",
      "“So the two of us sat there, exchanging these grim words,\n",
      "I on one side with my sword held over the blood,\n",
      "on the other, addressing me, the wraith of my companion.\n",
      "“Then there drew near the ghost of my dead mother,\n",
      "Antikleia, daughter of great-hearted Autolykos,\n",
      "85\n",
      "whom I’d left alive when I first sailed for sacred Ilion.\n",
      "On seeing her I wept, and pitied her in my heart;\n",
      "Yet not even so, for all my deep sorrow, would I\n",
      "let her come near the blood till I’d questioned Teirēsias.\n",
      "And then he came, did the ghost of Thēban Teirēsias,\n",
      "90\n",
      "gold staff in hand, and he recognized and addressed me:\n",
      "‘Son of Laërtēs, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "why, hapless man, have you turned your back on the sunlight\n",
      "and come to gaze on the dead and their joyless region?\n",
      "Stand back from the pit, and take your sharp sword away,\n",
      "95\n",
      "so I can drink of the blood, and speak words of truth to you.’\n",
      "“So he spoke, and I drew back, returning my silver-studded\n",
      "sword to its sheath; only when he’d drunk the dark blood\n",
      "did the matchless seer address me, saying: ‘Great Odysseus,\n",
      "you want to know all about your sweet homecoming.\n",
      "100\n",
      "This a god will make hard for you: I do not foresee\n",
      "you escaping the Earth-Shaker’s notice. He holds a grudge\n",
      "against you, is wrathful because you blinded his dear son.\n",
      "Yet even so you can make it, though after much hardship,\n",
      "if you’re willing to curb your own and your comrades’ spirits\n",
      "105\n",
      "from the moment you put in with your well-built ship,\n",
      "forsaking the violet deep, to the isle of Thrinakiē\n",
      "and find there at pasture the cattle and well-fed sheep\n",
      "of Hēlios, the all-seeing, all-hearing sun. If you\n",
      "leave these unharmed and take care over your return\n",
      "110\n",
      "you may still get home to Ithákē, after much suffering;\n",
      "but should you harm them, then I foresee destruction\n",
      "for your ship and your comrades. You yourself may escape,\n",
      "but you’ll get home late and in bad shape, your comrades all lost,\n",
      "in a ship not your own, find troubles plaguing your house—\n",
      "115\n",
      "arrogant fellows installed there, devouring your livelihood,\n",
      "wooing your godlike wife and sending her bridal gifts!\n",
      "Indeed, when you come you’ll avenge their violent conduct,\n",
      "but when you’ve killed off the suitors in your halls,\n",
      "whether by guile or openly with the sharp bronze,\n",
      "120\n",
      "then you must set out again, taking a well-shaped oar,\n",
      "until you come among men who know nothing of the sea,\n",
      "who eat their food without putting salt in it,\n",
      "and have never set eyes on ships with purple cheeks\n",
      "or on the well-shaped oars that serve as a ship’s wings;\n",
      "125\n",
      "and I’ll tell you a very clear sign, one that won’t escape you:\n",
      "when on the road you meet another man who believes\n",
      "it’s a winnowing-fan that you have on your sturdy shoulder,\n",
      "then fix your well-shaped oar on end in the ground,\n",
      "and offer a lavish sacrifice to the lord Poseidōn—\n",
      "130\n",
      "a ram, a bull, and a stud boar that mounts its sows.\n",
      "Then go back home, and make rich sacred offerings\n",
      "to the immortal gods who possess broad heaven,\n",
      "in due order. Death will come to you from the sea,2\n",
      "the gentlest of ends, but will take you only after\n",
      "135\n",
      "you’ve worn out a sleek old age, with your people round you\n",
      "prospering. This that I tell you is the truth.’\n",
      "“So he spoke, and I then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "‘Teirēsias, it may be that the gods have spun this thread.\n",
      "But come, now tell me this, and answer me truthfully:\n",
      "140\n",
      "I see before me the shade of my departed mother,\n",
      "sitting, silent, close to the blood. I am her own son,\n",
      "yet she’s not brought herself to look at me or address me!\n",
      "Tell me, my lord, how may she know me for who I am?’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and at once he responded to me, saying:\n",
      "145\n",
      "‘Very simple the answer I’ll give you and put in your mind:\n",
      "Whosoever of those that are dead and gone you permit\n",
      "to come up to the blood will converse with you truthfully;\n",
      "but any that you refuse will go back to where they came from.’\n",
      "“So saying, the ghost of the lord Teirēsias departed\n",
      "150\n",
      "back to Hadēs’ domain, after stating the gods’ decrees;\n",
      "but I waited steadfastly there, until my mother\n",
      "came up and drank the dark blood, and knew me at once,\n",
      "and addressed me sorrowfully, with winged words, saying:\n",
      "‘My child, how did you penetrate this murky darkness\n",
      "155\n",
      "while alive? Hard for the living to get to see these realms,\n",
      "for between them lie great rivers, awesome streams,\n",
      "Ocean above all, which may in no wise be crossed\n",
      "on foot, but only with a well-found ship! Have your\n",
      "long wanderings after Troy still brought you no further\n",
      "160\n",
      "than this with your ship and your comrades? Haven’t you yet\n",
      "reached Ithákē, or seen your wife and your own domain?’\n",
      "“So she spoke, and I then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "‘My mother, need brought me down here to Hadēs’ realm:\n",
      "I had to consult the shade of Thēban Teirēsias.\n",
      "165\n",
      "Not yet have I come near Achaia, not yet have I set foot\n",
      "on my own land, I’ve been wandering, grief-stricken,\n",
      "since I first followed the godlike lord Agamemnōn\n",
      "to Ilion, home of fine horses, to fight against the Trojans.\n",
      "But now tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\n",
      "170\n",
      "What fated exit of death was it overcame you?\n",
      "Some wasting disease? Or did Artemis the archer\n",
      "with her gentle shafts assail you and lay you low?\n",
      "Tell me, too, of the father and son I left behind there—\n",
      "Are my privileges still with them, or does some other\n",
      "175\n",
      "man now possess them? Do they say I’ll not return?\n",
      "And what of my wedded wife? Her thoughts? Her plans?\n",
      "Has she held on with her son? Kept everything as it was?\n",
      "Or is she now remarried, to the best man of the Achaians?’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and my lady mother answered me at once:\n",
      "180\n",
      "‘Truly indeed she holds on with steadfast spirit\n",
      "there in your halls: for her the nights and days\n",
      "waste away in unending sorrow amid her tears.\n",
      "As for your fine privileges, no man’s assumed them, although\n",
      "Tēlemachos now, unchallenged, possesses your acres,\n",
      "185\n",
      "and orders the common feasts, as is right for a lawgiver\n",
      "whom all men acknowledge. But your father stays away\n",
      "in the country, and never comes into town. He has\n",
      "no bed with proper bedclothes, rugs and bright coverlets,\n",
      "but sleeps in winter along with the slaves in the house,\n",
      "190\n",
      "in the ashes close to the fire, and wears old ragged clothes.\n",
      "But when summer comes, and flourishing autumn, then\n",
      "all over the rising slope of his vine-clad orchard\n",
      "the ground is strewn with the fallen leaves for his bed.\n",
      "There he lies in his sorrow, heart nursing one great grief,\n",
      "195\n",
      "yearning for your return: old age weighs heavy on him.\n",
      "Thus it was that I too perished and met my fate:\n",
      "Neither in our abode did the deadly archer goddess\n",
      "lay me low in a visitation with her gentle shafts,\n",
      "nor did any disease come upon me, the kind most likely\n",
      "200\n",
      "with loathsome wasting to sever the spirit from my limbs:\n",
      "it was rather my yearning for you, illustrious Odysseus,\n",
      "for your wisdom, your kindness, that robbed me of sweet life.’\n",
      "“So she spoke, and I wanted, pondering in my heart,\n",
      "to embrace the ghost of my mother, now dead and gone:\n",
      "205\n",
      "three times I moved to clasp her, as my heart urged me,\n",
      "three times she eluded my arms, like some shadow or dream,\n",
      "so that the pain in my heart grew ever sharper,\n",
      "and I spoke, addressed her with winged words, saying: ‘Mother,\n",
      "why won’t you stay here when I want to hold you,\n",
      "210\n",
      "so that even in Hadēs the two of us can cast arms\n",
      "about one another, and get our fill of chill lamentation?\n",
      "Is this some phantom set on me by holy Persephonē\n",
      "to add yet more to the weight of my grief and sorrow?’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and my lady mother answered me at once:\n",
      "215\n",
      "‘Alas, my child, ill-fated beyond all other mortals,\n",
      "Persephonē, daughter of Zeus, is in no way beguiling you.\n",
      "No, this is the fixed law for mortals, when anyone dies:\n",
      "The sinews no longer keep flesh and bones together,\n",
      "they’re destroyed by the powerful force of blazing fire\n",
      "220\n",
      "as soon as the spirit departs from the white bones\n",
      "and the soul, like a dream, flies fluttering off, is gone.\n",
      "But quick, hurry back to the light now, with all these things\n",
      "stored in your mind, to tell your wife hereafter.’\n",
      "“So we two conversed together, and now the women\n",
      "225\n",
      "approached us, those sent up by holy Persephonē,\n",
      "all those who had been great chieftains’ wives or daughters.\n",
      "In throngs now they all gathered around the dark blood\n",
      "while I considered how I should question each individual.\n",
      "And this, to my mind, emerged as the best plan:\n",
      "230\n",
      "I drew the long sword from beside my sturdy thigh\n",
      "and would not let them all drink the dark blood together.\n",
      "So they approached me in turn, one after the other.\n",
      "Each told me her lineage. I interrogated them all.\n",
      "“Now the first one that I saw there was high-born Tyrō,\n",
      "235\n",
      "who said she was descended from peerless Salmōneus,\n",
      "and declared herself the wife of Aiolos’ son Krētheus.\n",
      "She fell in love with divine Enipeus, the river,\n",
      "loveliest of all rivers that discharge their streams on earth,\n",
      "and she used to haunt Enipeus’ beautiful waters.\n",
      "240\n",
      "Assuming Enipeus’ form, the Earth-Shaking Earth-Supporter\n",
      "lay with her at the outflow of the eddying river,\n",
      "and the dark wave stood up round them like a mountain,\n",
      "arching over, concealing the god and the mortal woman.\n",
      "He undid her virgin sash, shed sleep down on her,\n",
      "245\n",
      "then, when the god had completed the actions of love,\n",
      "he clasped her hand and addressed her, saying: ‘Lady,\n",
      "be glad of this lovemaking! As the time of the year comes round\n",
      "you will bear fine offspring: not issueless are the couplings\n",
      "of the immortals! Look after these children, raise them.\n",
      "250\n",
      "For now, though, go back home, keep quiet, say nothing.\n",
      "But know that I am Poseidōn, the Earth-Shaker!’\n",
      "“So saying,\n",
      "he plunged down into the billowing deep. And she\n",
      "indeed conceived, gave birth to Pelias and to Nēleus,\n",
      "who grew to become strong henchmen of mighty Zeus,\n",
      "255\n",
      "both of them: Pelias dwelt in Iolkos’ broad terrain,\n",
      "with a wealth of flocks, and Nēleus in sandy Pylos.\n",
      "Other sons this queen among women bore to Krētheus:\n",
      "Aisōn, Pherēs, Amythaōn the joyful chariot fighter.\n",
      "“After her I saw Antiopē, daughter of Asōpos,\n",
      "260\n",
      "who boasted that she’d slept in the arms of Zeus himself,\n",
      "and bore him twin sons, Amphiōn and Zēthos, who\n",
      "first laid the foundations of seven-gated Thēbai,\n",
      "and walled it about, since lacking walls they could not\n",
      "dwell in broad-landed Thēbai, powerful though they were.3\n",
      "265\n",
      "“After her I saw Alkmēnē, Amphitryōn’s bedfellow,\n",
      "she who conceived Hēraklēs—bold fighter, lion-hearted—\n",
      "when she embraced and coupled with mighty Zeus.\n",
      "Megarē too I saw, high-spirited Kreiōn’s daughter,\n",
      "wife to Amphitryōn’s son, a man of unwearied strength.4\n",
      "270\n",
      "“Oedipus’ mother I saw, the beautiful Epikastē,\n",
      "who unwittingly did a most terrible deed: she married\n",
      "her own son: he wed her after killing his father.\n",
      "Straightaway the gods revealed all this to mankind.\n",
      "Yet he in his much-loved Thēbai, though racked with grief,\n",
      "275\n",
      "by the gods’ grim design still reigned over the Kadmeians,\n",
      "while she went down to the realm of Hadēs, strong gatekeeper,\n",
      "after hanging a sheer noose from the lofty ceiling,\n",
      "possessed by her grief, bequeathing him countless woes,\n",
      "all that a mother’s Furies might bring to pass.5\n",
      "“And I saw\n",
      "280\n",
      "the exquisite Chlōris, that woman whom Nēleus once\n",
      "wed for her looks, when he’d brought her endless bridal gifts;\n",
      "youngest daughter she was of Amphiōn, Iasos’ son6—\n",
      "who once in Minyan Orchomenos ruled with a forceful hand—\n",
      "and queen of Pylos too: she bore him illustrious children:\n",
      "285\n",
      "Nestōr and Chromios, Periklymenos the much-honored,\n",
      "and besides these she bore gorgeous Pērō, a wonder to mortals.\n",
      "Her all the men living round sought in marriage. But Nēleus\n",
      "would bestow her on him alone who drove from Phylakē\n",
      "the broad-browed crumple-horned cattle of powerful Iphiklēs—\n",
      "290\n",
      "a hard lot they were, and none but the matchless seer\n",
      "undertook to drive them off; but a hard fate set by the god\n",

      "Nevertheless, when the months and days were completed\n",
      "of the circling year, and the seasons in turn came round,\n",
      "295\n",
      "he was let go by powerful Iphiklēs, once he’d told him\n",

      "poor wretch, are you leading the kind of grim existence\n",
      "such as I too bore beneath the rays of the sun?\n",
      "I was Kronos’ son Zeus’ offspring, and yet I suffered\n",
      "620\n",
      "woes beyond measure, for I was placed in subjection\n",
      "to a man far worse man than myself,14 who laid hard labors on me.\n",
      "He even once sent me here to get Hadēs’ hound:15 he could think\n",
      "of no harder labor for me than this. Yet that hound I did\n",
      "indeed carry off and bring up out of Hadēs—\n",
      "625\n",
      "I had Hermēs and grey-eyed Athēnē serving as my guides.’\n",
      "“So saying, he went on his way, back into Hadēs’ realm,\n",

      "but before that, great swarms of the dead came thronging up\n",

      "that the head of the Gorgon, that ghastly monster, might\n",
      "be sent against me from Hadēs by holy Persephonē.\n",
      "635\n",
      "“So at once I went back to the ship, and ordered my comrades\n",
      "to embark again themselves, and cast off the stern warps.\n",
      "So they came aboard quickly, and sat down on the benches,\n",

      "of Aiaia, where is the abode of Dawn, the early riser,\n",
      "and her dancing floors, and the risings of Hēlios the sun,\n",
      "then we beached our vessel, hauled her up on the sands,\n",
      "5\n",
      "and ourselves disembarked on the seashore. There we fell\n",

      "unaware that we’d got back from Hādēs: very promptly\n",
      "she readied herself, and came out. The handmaids with her\n",
      "brought bread and much meat, and tawny-red wine, and she,\n",
      "bright among goddesses, now spoke in the midst of us, saying:\n",
      "20\n",
      "‘Foolhardy men, who went down to Hādēs’ realm alive,\n",
      "and met death twice, when others die only the once!\n",

      "you’ll set sail. I’ll show you your route and brief you\n",
      "25\n",
      "on every detail. That way, no ruinous bad decisions,\n",
      "at sea or ashore, will leave you in desperate trouble.’\n",
      "“So she spoke: the proud spirit in us was persuaded.\n",

      "went down, and darkness came on, then all the others\n",
      "lay down to sleep beside the ship’s stern warps;\n",
      "but me Kirkē took by the hand, led apart from my comrades,\n",
      "made me sit down, then questioned me in detail,\n",
      "and I told her the whole story, just as it happened.\n",
      "35\n",
      "Thereupon the lady Kirkē spoke at length to me, saying:\n",

      "I shall tell you: the god himself will remind you of it.\n",
      "First off, you’ll come to the Sirens. They bewitch\n",
      "and beguile all mortals who come within earshot of them.\n",
      "40\n",
      "Any man who unwittingly gets close enough to hear\n",
      "the Sirens’ voices will never again be surrounded\n",
      "by wife and children greeting him on his return home;\n",
      "the Sirens will enchant him with their clear high singing\n",
      "as they sit in a meadow, among great heaps of bones\n",
      "45\n",
      "from men’s rotted bodies, the skin on them all shriveled.\n",
      "Row on past them, and stop up the ears of your comrades\n",
      "with beeswax—soften it first—so none of them can hear.\n",
      "But as for yourself, if you’re determined to listen,\n",
      "have them tie you, hand and foot, while upright, against\n",
      "50\n",
      "your swift ship’s mast, in its step, with rope ends lashed\n",
      "to the mast itself, so you can hear and enjoy the Sirens.\n",
      "But if you beg and command your comrades to release you,\n",
      "they are then to bind you more firmly with yet more bonds!\n",
      "Then, when your comrades have rowed you beyond the Sirens,\n",
      "55\n",
      "from that point on, I’ll no longer tell you in full detail\n",
      "which course is the one to follow, but you yourself\n",
      "must make up your mind. I shall give you two options.\n",
      "On the one side are crags, overhanging, and against them\n",
      "crash the great breakers of dark-eyed Amphitrītē:\n",
      "60\n",
      "these crags the blessed gods call the Wandering Rocks.\n",
      "That way not even winged creatures go, not even the shy\n",
      "doves that carry ambrosia to Zeus the Father: the smooth-\n",
      "worn rock always snatches one at least of these away,\n",
      "and the Father sends in another to restore the numbers.\n",

      "No mortal vessel that tried it has ever got past those rocks—\n",

      "save that one seafaring vessel which alone escaped them:\n",
      "Argo, of worldwide fame, sailing home from Aiētēs—\n",
      "70\n",
      "and she too would soon have been slammed into those great crags\n",
      "had Hērē not steered her safe through, out of love for Jason.1\n",
      "‘Next are the two headlands. One of them towers up\n",
      "to broad heaven, with a sharp peak. Dark clouds surround it,\n",
      "that never disperse: its summit never enjoys clear air,\n",
      "75\n",
      "not even in spring or autumn. There’s not a man alive\n",
      "could scale that peak or set foot on its crest, not even\n",
      "were he endowed with a score of hands and feet,\n",
      "for the rock is as smooth as though it had been polished.\n",
      "Halfway up this headland there’s a murky cavern\n",
      "80\n",
      "facing west, toward the dusk and Erebos. It’s that way\n",
      "you should steer your hollow ship, illustrious Odysseus,\n",
      "from which hollow ship not even the strongest man\n",
      "could shoot an arrow up into that cave’s interior.\n",
      "There, in it, dwells Skyllē, yelping most fearsomely;\n",
      "85\n",
      "Her voice may be only as loud as that of a newborn puppy,\n",
      "but she is an evil monster, the sight of whom would please\n",
      "nobody, were it even a god who encountered her.\n",
      "A dozen legs she has, all waving in the air,\n",
      "and six necks, very lengthy, and on every one of them\n",
      "90\n",
      "a horrible head, with three rows of teeth in each,\n",
      "close-set and crowded, all full of black death. From below\n",
      "the waist her body is hidden inside the hollow cavern,\n",
      "but her heads she stretches out from that fearsome abyss\n",
      "and goes fishing there, searches all around the rock face\n",
      "95\n",
      "for dolphin or dogfish or whatever larger creature\n",
      "she can catch of the thousands loud Amphitrītē breeds.\n",
      "Past her no sailors yet can boast of having voyaged\n",
      "unharmed, for with each of her heads she carries off\n",
      "a man that she snatches out of his dark-prowed vessel.\n",
      "100\n",
      "‘But the other headland, Odysseus, as you’ll see, is lower—\n",
      "the two are close together, within easy bowshot—\n",
      "and on it grows a great fig tree with luxuriant foliage.\n",
      "Beneath this divine Charybdis sucks in the dark water—\n",
      "thrice daily she spews it out upward, thrice sucks it all back\n",
      "105\n",
      "with fearsome effect—may you never be there then!\n",
      "Not even the Earth-Shaker could save you from destruction.\n",
      "Rather hold course close to Skyllē’s headland and quickly\n",
      "steer your ship past it, since it’s far preferable\n",
      "to lose six of your crew than for all of you to perish.’\n",
      "110\n",
      "“So she spoke, and I then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "‘Come, I beg you, goddess. Tell me this truthfully: Is there\n",
      "any way I can both get clear of deadly Charybdis\n",
      "and stop the other, when she tries to snatch my comrades?’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and she, bright among goddesses, snapped back:\n",
      "115\n",
      "‘Foolhardy man, once again you’re set on deeds of warfare\n",
      "and hardship! Will you not yield even to the immortal\n",
      "gods? Because she’s not mortal, but an immortal evil,\n",
      "dread, disastrous, wild—and not to be fought with,\n",
      "for there’s no defense—best course is to flee from her.\n",
      "120\n",
      "For if you linger to arm yourself beside her rock\n",
      "I fear she may once again dart out and assault you\n",
      "with as many heads, and seize as many men as before.\n",
      "So row past at speed, while calling upon Krataiïs,\n",
      "Skyllē’s mother, who bore her to be a bane to mortals:\n",
      "125\n",
      "she then will stop her from making that second assault.\n",
      "‘So you’ll come to the isle of Thrinakiē. There at pasture\n",
      "are Hēlios’ numerous cattle and well-fed flocks:\n",
      "seven herds of oxen, and as many fine flocks of sheep,\n",
      "with fifty head in each herd. They never bear young,\n",
      "130\n",
      "nor do they ever grow old. They’re tended by goddesses,\n",
      "fair-tressed nymphs, Phaëthousa and Lampetiē,\n",
      "whom resplendent Neaira bore to Hyperiōn Hēlios.\n",
      "These their lady mother, when she’d borne and reared them,\n",
      "sent out to the isle of Thrinakiē, to a distant life\n",
      "135\n",
      "tending their father’s flocks and crumple-horned cattle.\n",
      "If you leave these unharmed and take care over your return\n",
      "you may still get home to Ithákē, after much suffering;\n",
      "but should you harm them, then I foresee destruction\n",
      "for your ship and your comrades. You yourself may escape,\n",
      "140\n",
      "though you’ll get home late, in bad shape, your comrades all lost.’\n",
      "“So she spoke, and then, golden-throned, the Dawn came up.\n",
      "She, bright among goddesses, departed up the island,\n",
      "while I went back to the ship and aroused my comrades\n",
      "to embark themselves and to cast off the stern warps;\n",
      "145\n",
      "they came aboard quickly and sat down at the benches,\n",
      "and in good order struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\n",
      "In the wake of our dark-prowed ship a following breeze\n",
      "that filled our sail, a trusty companion, was sent us\n",
      "by fair-tressed Kirkē, dread goddess of mortal speech.\n",
      "150\n",
      "So when we’d secured the tackle throughout the ship\n",
      "we sat down: wind and steersman now kept her on her course.\n",
      "“Then I finally, grieving at heart, addressed my comrades:\n",
      "‘Friends, since it’s not right that one or two only should know\n",
      "the gods’ decrees that Kirkē, bright among goddesses, told me,\n",
      "155\n",
      "I shall now relate them to you: it will be in that knowledge\n",
      "that we either die or escape, sidestepping death and fate.\n",
      "First, the heavenly Sirens. She bids us keep well away\n",
      "from them, their singing, and their flowery meadow.\n",
      "Me alone she wanted to hear them: you are to tie me fast\n",
      "160\n",
      "with harsh bonds, keep me upright in place against the mast,\n",
      "in its step, with rope ends lashed to the mast itself.\n",
      "But if I beg and command my comrades to release me,\n",
      "you are then to bind me more firmly with yet more bonds.’\n",
      "“Thus I was passing on all the details to my comrades,\n",
      "165\n",
      "and meanwhile our well-built ship very soon arrived\n",
      "at the Sirens’ isle, driven on by a following breeze.\n",
      "Abruptly the wind now dropped, and was replaced\n",
      "by a windless calm. Some god lulled the waves to sleep.\n",
      "My comrades stood up, took down and furled the sail,\n",
      "170\n",
      "stowed it down in the hollow ship, then sat at the benches\n",
      "and whitened the water with their polished pinewood oars.\n",
      "Now with the sharp bronze I cut a great wheel of wax\n",
      "into small bits, which I kneaded in my strong hands.\n",
      "Soon the wax grew warm under their great pressure\n",
      "175\n",
      "and the rays of the sun god, Hyperiōn Hēlios.2\n",
      "With this wax I stopped up the ears of all my comrades,\n",
      "and they bound me hand and foot, while standing, to the mast,\n",
      "in its step, with rope ends lashed to the mast itself,\n",
      "and then sat down, struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\n",
      "180\n",
      "“But when we were as far off as a man’s shout carries,\n",
      "swiftly pursuing our course, the speeding ship did not,\n",
      "as it neared, escape notice. The Sirens began their shrill song:\n",
      "‘Look in here on your way, famed Odysseus, the Achaians’ pride:\n",
      "put in with your ship, hear the song we two sing! Never yet\n",
      "185\n",
      "has any man rowed on past us in his black ship till he’s heard\n",
      "the honey-sweet music that issues from our mouths,\n",
      "and he voyages on rejoicing, his knowledge increased, for we\n",
      "know all the toil and suffering that in the wide land of Troy\n",
      "Argives and Trojans endured through the will of the gods:\n",
      "190\n",
      "Indeed, we know all things that happen on the nurturing earth.’\n",
      "“Such the words they uttered in their beautiful voices. My heart\n",
      "yearned to listen. I signaled my comrades to release me—\n",
      "a nod with my eyebrows. They bent to their oars, rowed on.\n",
      "Eurylochos and Perimēdēs both at once stood up,\n",
      "195\n",
      "bound me with further lashings, made them all tighter.\n",
      "But when they’d rowed past the Sirens, and no longer\n",
      "were their voices or their singing within earshot, then\n",
      "my loyal comrades at once removed the wax with which\n",
      "I’d blocked their ears, and released me from my bonds.\n",
      "200\n",
      "“But after we’d left that island, then very soon I saw\n",
      "smoke, and a heavy surf, and heard a thunderous noise.\n",
      "The rowers were frightened, the oars slipped from their grasp\n",
      "and hung clattering in the riptide; the ship came to a halt\n",
      "now they were no longer plying their shapely oar blades.\n",
      "205\n",
      "But I went through the ship encouraging my comrades\n",
      "with kindly words, approaching each man in turn: ‘My friends,\n",
      "we’ve not hitherto gone short on experience of trouble!\n",
      "This danger we face now is no greater than when the Kyklōps\n",
      "by brute force and strength shut us up in his hollow cave—\n",
      "210\n",
      "even then, my courage, invention, and presence of mind\n",
      "freed us: this peril too, I think, we’ll live to recall!\n",
      "So now, please all do exactly as I command: you must\n",
      "stay seated there at the rowlocks and with your oars\n",
      "strike the deep surf of the sea, so that maybe Zeus\n",
      "215\n",
      "will grant that we escape, steer clear of this evil fate.\n",
      "And to you, steersman, I give this command: store it well\n",
      "in your memory—you control the hollow ship’s helm!\n",
      "Keep the ship well away from all this smoke and surf:\n",
      "stay close to the headland, don’t let her veer unnoticed\n",
      "220\n",
      "across to the other side, or you’ll destroy us all.’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and they promptly obeyed the commands I gave them.\n",
      "But not yet did I mention Skyllē, that irremovable danger,\n",
      "for fear lest my comrades, terrified, might abandon\n",
      "their rowing, and cower together down in the hold.\n",
      "225\n",
      "It was now I forgot Kirkē’s troublesome instruction\n",
      "that for no purpose whatsoever should I now arm myself.\n",
      "I put on my battle gear, I picked out two long spears,\n",
      "and carrying them made my way to the vessel’s foredeck,\n",
      "from where, I figured, this rock-based Skyllē would first\n",
      "230\n",
      "be glimpsed as she brought disaster to my comrades.\n",
      "But nowhere could I discern her, and my eyes grew weary\n",
      "from searching every part of the murky rock face.\n",
      "“So on through the narrow strait, lamenting, we sailed—and there\n",
      "on one side was Skyllē, on the other bright Charybdis\n",
      "235\n",
      "fearsomely sucking in the salt seawater: when she\n",
      "spewed it back out, like a cauldron over a blazing fire,\n",
      "she was all seething turbulence, and the flying spray\n",
      "was flung up so high that it rained down on the tops\n",
      "of both headlands; when she sucked the salt seawater back,\n",
      "240\n",
      "she exposed her wild inner turmoil, while all around\n",
      "the rock roared: beneath it the bottom was revealed,\n",
      "black with sand. Pale fear now possessed my men,\n",
      "we gazed at Charybdis in terror, fearing destruction.\n",
      "Skyllē meanwhile snatched up from the hollow ship\n",
      "245\n",
      "six of my comrades, the strongest and most active.\n",
      "Though my eyes were on the swift ship and my company,\n",
      "I still caught a glimpse of their hands and feet above me\n",
      "as they were whirled aloft. They cried out aloud,\n",
      "called me by name one last time in their anguish. As when\n",
      "250\n",
      "a fisherman with his long rod on a jutting rock\n",
      "throws down bits of bait as a lure when fish are scarce,\n",
      "and lets down into the deep the horn of a country ox,\n",
      "then grabs the hooked gasping victim, flings it ashore—\n",
      "so they were carried up, gasping, toward the rocks.\n",
      "255\n",
      "There at her entrance she devoured them, as they screamed\n",
      "and stretched out hands to me in their dire death struggle.\n",
      "That was the most piteous sight of all that ever I endured\n",
      "throughout my whole exploration of the paths of the deep.\n",
      "“Then when we’d escaped the rocks and fearsome Charybdis\n",
      "260\n",
      "and Skyllē, soon after that we arrived at the god’s\n",
      "matchless island, where were the splendid broad-browed cattle\n",
      "and numerous well-fed flocks of Hyperiōn Hēlios.\n",
      "While still out at sea in my black ship, I could hear\n",
      "the lowing of cattle on the way back to their farmstead\n",
      "265\n",
      "and the bleating of sheep; and into my mind now stole\n",
      "the words of the blind seer, of Thēban Teirēsias,\n",
      "and of Aiaian Kirkē, who most strongly advised me\n",
      "to avoid the island of Hēlios, bright delight of mortals;\n",
      "and then, grieved at heart, I spoke out among my comrades:\n",
      "270\n",
      "‘Distressed though you are, my comrades, mark my words well\n",
      "while I tell you of the prophetic warning Teirēsias uttered,\n",
      "he and Aiaian Kirkē: they most strongly advised me\n",
      "to avoid the island of Hēlios, bright delight of mortals,\n",
      "for there, she told me, was our most dreadful danger.\n",
      "275\n",
      "So, row our black ship straight on past this island.’\n",
      "“So I spoke,\n",
      "and the spirit within them was broken. But at once\n",
      "Eurylochos responded to me in chilling language:\n",
      "‘You’re a hard man, Odysseus, with rare strength: your limbs\n",
      "never tire, every last bit of you is fashioned of iron:\n",
      "280\n",
      "you won’t let your comrades, worn out by sleeplessness\n",
      "and toil, disembark, when we might indeed once more\n",
      "on this sea-girt isle find the stuff for a tasty supper! But no,\n",
      "you’re making us wander on through the speeding night,\n",
      "steering away from this island over the murky deep!\n",
      "285\n",
      "It’s night that breeds dangerous winds, the wreckers of ships—\n",
      "how indeed could we escape from utter destruction\n",
      "should some sudden tearing gale bear down upon us\n",
      "from the south or the storm-ridden west wind, which most often\n",
      "break up ships in despite of the gods, their sovereign lords?\n",
      "290\n",
      "No, let us now rather yield to black night, put in,\n",
      "stay close by the black ship to prepare our supper, and then\n",
      "in the morning embark, sail out over the broad sea.’\n",
      "“So Eurylochos spoke: the rest of my comrades applauded.\n",
      "I saw now what kind of trouble some god had in store for us,\n",
      "295\n",
      "and so I spoke and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "‘Eurylochos, you force my hand: I’m one man only. But listen:\n",
      "I want all of you here present to swear me a mighty oath,\n",
      "that if we come on a herd of cattle, or a great flock\n",
      "of sheep, no man will succumb to maleficent recklessness\n",
      "300\n",
      "and slaughter either a steer or a sheep. Rather show restraint\n",
      "and eat the food that immortal Kirkē provided for us.’\n",
      "“So I spoke. They at once swore not to, as I requested,\n",
      "and when they had sworn and completed the oath, then we\n",
      "moored our well-built ship inside the hollow harbor\n",
      "305\n",
      "near a freshwater spring, and my comrades disembarked\n",
      "from the ship and expertly then set about preparing supper.\n",
      "But when they’d put from them the desire for food and drink,\n",
      "then they began to weep, recalling their dear shipmates\n",
      "whom Skyllē had snatched from the hollow ship and devoured,\n",
      "310\n",
      "and sweet sleep came upon them while they were weeping.\n",
      "But in the night’s third watch, when the stars were setting,\n",
      "Zeus the cloud-gatherer raised a blustering wind against us\n",
      "with a tremendous tempest, sent storm clouds that hid\n",
      "both land and sea: from heaven there sprang forth night.\n",
      "315\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "we dragged our ship to a roomy cave and made her fast there,\n",
      "where the nymphs had their fine dance floors, held their meetings.\n",
      "Then I called an assembly and addressed my comrades, saying:\n",
      "‘Friends, in our swift ship there is both food and drink:\n",
      "320\n",
      "so let’s keep our hands off the cattle, lest we come to harm,\n",
      "for these cows and well-fed sheep belong to a dread god,\n",
      "Hēlios, who both sees and hears everything.\n",
      "“So I spoke:\n",
      "and their proud hearts were persuaded. But after that\n",
      "for an entire month nonstop the south wind blew,\n",
      "325\n",
      "and no other wind arose, apart from the east and south.\n",
      "Now so long as the men still were getting food and red wine\n",
      "they kept their hands off the cattle, being anxious to stay alive;\n",
      "but when the provisions in the ship were all exhausted,\n",
      "and they were driven by need to go in search of game—\n",
      "330\n",
      "fish or fowl, whatever might come to hand,\n",
      "angling with bent hooks, for hunger wore down their bellies—\n",
      "then I went off up the island, to pray to the gods:\n",
      "one of them possibly might show me the road to take.\n",
      "So when going through the island I’d left my comrades,\n",
      "335\n",
      "I found shelter from the wind and washed my hands,\n",
      "and prayed to all the gods that possess Olympos. But what\n",
      "they did was to shed sweet sleep upon my eyelids,\n",
      "while Eurylochos was giving bad advice to my comrades:\n",
      "‘Distressed though you are, my comrades, mark my words well:\n",
      "340\n",
      "All kinds of death are loathsome to wretched mortals,\n",
      "but to die of starvation—that’s the most pitiful of fates!\n",
      "Come, let’s rather drive off the best of Hēlios’ cattle,\n",
      "and sacrifice to the immortals who hold wide heaven!\n",
      "And if ever we get to Ithákē, our native country,\n",
      "345\n",
      "we’ll at once build a lavish temple to Hyperiōn Hēlios,\n",
      "and fill it with plenty of high-class dedications!\n",
      "And if he’s angry with us because of his straight-horned cattle,\n",
      "and wants to destroy our ship, and the other gods agree,\n",
      "I’d rather gulp down seawater and get it over\n",
      "350\n",
      "than starve to death slowly here on this desolate island.’\n",
      "“So Eurylochos spoke, and my other comrades assented.\n",
      "At once they drove off the best cattle of Hēlios,\n",
      "from nearby, since it wasn’t far from our dark-prowed vessel\n",
      "that his fine cows, broad of brow and crumple-horned,3\n",
      "355\n",
      "were grazing. Around these they stood and prayed to the gods,\n",
      "with the fresh leaves they’d plucked from a tall oak’s foliage,\n",
      "since they had no white barley aboard the well-benched ship.\n",
      "When they’d prayed and slit the cows’ throats and flayed them,\n",
      "they cut out the thighs, wrapped them up in a double layer\n",
      "360\n",
      "of fat, and placed above them cuts of raw meat. They had\n",
      "no wine left that they could pour over the blazing sacrifice,\n",
      "so they made libations with water, roasted the innards.\n",
      "But when the thighs had been burnt and they’d tasted the entrails,\n",
      "then they chopped up the rest and threaded it on spits.\n",
      "365\n",
      "It was now that sweet sleep retreated from my eyelids,\n",
      "and I set off back to our swift ship and the seashore.\n",
      "But when, as I went, I came close to our shapely vessel,\n",
      "the sweet aroma of roast meat filled the air around me,\n",
      "and I groaned and cried out aloud to the immortal gods:\n",
      "370\n",
      "‘Zeus, Father, and you other blessed gods that are forever,\n",
      "it was indeed to my ruin that you lulled me with pitiless sleep\n",
      "while the comrades I’d left behind committed this monstrous act!’\n",
      "“At once to Hyperiōn Hēlios long-robed Lampetiē\n",
      "came with the news that we had slaughtered his cattle.\n",
      "375\n",
      "Angered at heart, he at once spoke up among the immortals:\n",
      "‘Zeus, Father, and you other blessed gods that are forever,\n",
      "take revenge on the crew of Odysseus, Laërtēs’ son,\n",
      "who have wantonly slaughtered the cattle in which I took\n",
      "such pleasure each time I ascended the starry heaven\n",
      "380\n",
      "and when I turned back down again from heaven to earth.\n",
      "If they don’t compensate me fittingly for my cattle,\n",
      "I shall go down to Hadēs and spread light among the dead.’\n",
      "“Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer responded to him, saying:\n",
      "‘Hēlios, please go on shining among the immortals\n",
      "385\n",
      "and on mortal mankind upon the grain-giving earth!\n",
      "These men’s swift ship I’ll soon hit with a bright thunderbolt\n",
      "in the midst of the wine-dark deep and shatter to fragments.’\n",
      "“This exchange I learned about later from fair-haired Kalypsō,\n",
      "who said she herself had heard it from Hermēs the Guide.\n",
      "390\n",
      "“But when I came back down to the ship and the sea,\n",
      "I rebuked all my men, confronting each one of them in turn;\n",
      "but we found no solution. The cows were already dead.\n",
      "Now too for my men the gods made a show of portents:\n",
      "the hides crawled, the meat, both raw and roasted, mooed\n",
      "395\n",
      "on the spits, there was a sound like that of lowing cattle.\n",
      "“For six days now my oh-so-trusty comrades dined\n",
      "on Hēlios’ best cattle that they’d driven off; but when\n",
      "Zeus son of Kronos brought the seventh day upon us,\n",
      "then the wind stopped blowing at gale force, and we promptly\n",
      "400\n",
      "boarded our ship and set forth into the wide sea, after\n",
      "first stepping the mast and hoisting the white sail on it.\n",
      "But once we’d left the island behind, and there was no other\n",
      "land above our horizon, nothing but sky and sea,\n",
      "then the son of Kronos conjured up a black cloud\n",
      "405\n",
      "over our hollow ship, and the deep beneath it darkened.\n",
      "She ran on for no long time, since suddenly there came\n",
      "a screaming west wind, a tempest blowing at full gale force.\n",
      "The blast of that wind snapped the forestays holding the mast,\n",
      "both of them—back fell the mast, and all its tackle\n",
      "410\n",
      "dropped pell-mell into the bilge; at the stern of the vessel\n",
      "the mast struck the steersman’s head, crushing all\n",
      "the bones of his skull together. He like a diver fell\n",
      "from the deck, and clear of the bones his proud spirit fled.\n",
      "Zeus with a clap of thunder hurled his bolt at our vessel:\n",
      "415\n",
      "she shuddered her whole length, struck by the bolt of Zeus,\n",
      "and was filled with the reek of sulfur. The crew all fell overboard,\n",
      "and like shearwaters went bobbing around our black ship\n",
      "borne up by the waves. The god deprived them of their return.\n",
      "But I kept my foothold aboard until the surge tore sides\n",
      "420\n",
      "from keel. The stripped keel the waves now bore off, broke\n",
      "the mast loose at keel level. Attached to the mast\n",
      "was a backstay fashioned of oxhide. This I seized,\n",
      "and lashed the two together, the keel and the mast.\n",
      "Riding on these, I let the fierce winds sweep me away.\n",
      "425\n",
      "“But then the tempestuous gale-force west wind ceased,\n",
      "and at once instead came the south wind, cause for alarm,\n",
      "since it would carry me back to murderous Charybdis.\n",
      "All night long it so bore me, until at sunrise I came\n",
      "to the headland of Skyllē and to dread Charybdis, who now\n",
      "430\n",
      "sucked in the salt seawater; but I reached up\n",
      "as high as I could, caught hold of the tall fig tree,\n",
      "and clung to it like a bat. Yet I could in no way manage\n",
      "to get firm foothold or to climb up on it, since\n",
      "its roots were far distant, its branches high, out of reach,\n",
      "435\n",
      "long, massive, overshadowing Charybdis. So there\n",
      "I clung on persistently, waiting for her to spew back\n",
      "the mast and keel again. To my delight, back they came,\n",
      "though late—at the hour a man leaves assembly for supper,\n",
      "one who judges the many disputes of quarrelsome young men,\n",
      "440\n",
      "then it was that those timbers resurfaced out of Charybdis.\n",
      "I let go my handhold and foothold, went plunging down,\n",
      "hit the water ahead of the lengthy spars, and sitting\n",
      "astride them steered my way onward with both hands.\n",
      "But Skyllē the Father of gods and men did not permit\n",
      "445\n",
      "to see me again, or I’d not have avoided sheer destruction.\n",
      "“Nine days I was carried from there, and on the tenth night\n",
      "I was brought by the gods to the isle of Ōgygia, where\n",
      "fair-haired Kalypsō dwells, dread goddess of human speech,\n",
      "who befriended and cared for me. But why tell you this story?\n",
      "450\n",
      "I’ve told it already, just yesterday, here in your house\n",
      "to you and your comely wife. I really dislike repeating\n",
      "a tale that’s been clearly narrated on a previous occasion.”\n",
      "Book 13\n",
      "So he spoke: every one of them sat hushed and silent,\n",
      "enthralled by his words, throughout the shadowy hall.\n",
      "Then Alkinoös once again responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Odysseus, now you’ve come to my brazen-floored home\n",
      "with its high roof, I don’t think you’ll be driven back here again\n",
      "5\n",
      "on your homeward journey, despite all your misadventures!\n",
      "This I say along with a charge on each man here present—\n",
      "all you who in my halls daily drink up the elders’\n",
      "tawny-red wine, and sit on here, listening to the singer.\n",
      "Clothes are laid by for the stranger in a polished chest,\n",
      "10\n",
      "and finely wrought gold, together with all those other gifts\n",
      "that the counselors of the Phaiakians brought here. But come,\n",
      "let’s each one of us now present him with a great tripod\n",
      "and cauldron: we’ll recoup the cost by a public collection—\n",
      "it’s hard for one man to spend that much without repayment.”\n",
      "15\n",
      "So spoke Alkinoös: what he said was pleasing to them.\n",
      "They now retired to rest, each man to his own house.\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "they went down to the ship with the bronze in which men delight.\n",
      "Alkinoös, princely in power, himself ranged through the ship,\n",
      "20\n",
      "stowing gifts under the benches, to ensure they would not\n",
      "get in the way of the rowers when they bent to their oars.\n",
      "Then they went to Alkinoös’ house and had their dinner.\n",
      "Alkinoös, princely in power, sacrificed an ox for them\n",
      "to Zeus of the dark clouds, son of Kronos, lord over all.\n",
      "25\n",
      "After burning the thighs, they sat down to the splendid feast\n",
      "with great enjoyment. Among them a divine bard performed—\n",
      "Dēmodokos, highly honored by the people. But Odysseus\n",
      "kept turning his head toward the bright-shining sun,\n",
      "impatient for it to start setting: he wanted to be gone.\n",
      "30\n",
      "As a man longs for supper, one with whose jointed plow\n",
      "two wine-dark oxen have all day furrowed the field,\n",
      "and gladly for him does the light of the sun go down\n",
      "that lets him, weary-kneed, head home for supper—\n",
      "so welcome to Odysseus was the arrival of sunset.\n",
      "35\n",
      "Then at once he addressed the Phaiakians, lovers of the oar,\n",
      "to Alkinoös above all declaring his mind, in these words:\n",
      "“Alkinoös, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\n",
      "pour libations, give me safe escort—and farewell to you all!\n",
      "Each thing that my heart desired has already been arranged:\n",
      "40\n",
      "conveyance, and gifts of friendship—may the heavenly deities\n",
      "make these turn out well for me! When I get home\n",
      "may I find my wife truly faithful, my friends all safe and sound!\n",
      "And may you who remain here give delight to your wedded\n",
      "wives and children, may the gods grant you excellence\n",
      "45\n",
      "of every sort, may no ills ever come among your people.”\n",
      "So he spoke. They all approved, and endorsed the order\n",
      "to give the stranger conveyance, since he’d spoken becomingly.\n",
      "Then mighty Alkinoös made a request to his herald, saying:\n",
      "“Pontonoös, mix us a bowl of wine and serve it to all\n",
      "50\n",
      "in the hall here, so we may pray to Zeus, the Father,\n",
      "and then give this stranger conveyance to his own country.”\n",
      "So he spoke. Pontonoös mixed the mind-honeying wine\n",
      "and served it to all in turn. They poured libations,\n",
      "from where they sat, to the blessed gods who hold\n",
      "55\n",
      "broad heaven. Then noble Odysseus stood up,\n",
      "and placed the two-handled cup in Arētē’s hands,\n",
      "and addressed her with winged words, saying: “O queen,\n",
      "may you fare well, now and forever, until old age\n",
      "and death, all mortals’ common lot, come on you!\n",
      "60\n",
      "I’m on my way now, and I wish you all joy in this house\n",
      "of your children and people, and of Alkinoös the king.”\n",
      "So spoke noble Odysseus, and stepped out across\n",
      "the threshold, and mighty Alkinoös sent the herald with him\n",
      "as his escort, down to the swift ship and the sea,\n",
      "65\n",
      "while Arētē sent serving women to accompany him,\n",
      "one bearing a fresh-washed mantle and tunic, another\n",
      "with orders to carry the close-packed chest, while a third\n",
      "brought the food and the red wine. When they arrived\n",
      "down by the ship and the sea, then quickly the noble\n",
      "70\n",
      "escorts took over these things and stowed them away\n",
      "in the hold of the vessel, all the food and drink.1\n",
      "For Odysseus they laid out a linen sheet and a blanket\n",
      "on the hollow ship’s deck astern to let him sleep soundly.\n",
      "He now went aboard himself and lay down, not speaking.\n",
      "75\n",
      "The crew, each in his place, seated themselves at the rowlocks,\n",
      "and cast off the hawser from the hole in the stone post.\n",
      "They bent to their task then, flung up the brine with their oar blades,\n",
      "and sweet sleep dropped on Odysseus, shuttered his eyelids,\n",
      "sweet, deep, and sound, most closely akin to death.\n",
      "80\n",
      "The ship—like four yoked stallions on the plain\n",
      "that all spring forward together under the whip’s strokes,\n",
      "and swiftly, high-stepping, gallop upon their way—\n",
      "likewise lifted her stern: in her wake there surged a wave,\n",
      "vast, dark-hued, of the roaring, many-voiced sea.\n",
      "85\n",
      "Safe and steady she ran—not even a falcon, the hawk\n",
      "that’s swiftest of all winged creatures, could fly faster,\n",
      "so quickly she sheared her way through the waves of the sea,\n",
      "bearing a man whose foresight matched that of the gods,\n",
      "who in the past had suffered many sorrows at heart\n",
      "90\n",
      "both in men’s wars and while braving the cruel sea,\n",
      "but now slept undisturbed, his sufferings all forgotten.2\n",
      "At the time of that brightest star’s rising, which most clearly\n",
      "comes to herald the light of Dawn,3 early risen, then it was\n",
      "that the seafaring vessel approached the island. There is\n",
      "95\n",
      "a certain harbor of Phorkys, that Old Man of the Sea,\n",
      "in the land of Ithákē, with two protruding headlands,\n",
      "each broken off short, and each crouched facing the harbor,\n",
      "which they shield from those heavy waves whipped up outside\n",
      "by powerful gales, while the well-benched ships lie within\n",
      "100\n",
      "unmoored, once they reach their position for anchorage.\n",
      "At the head of the harbor there grows a long-leafed olive tree,\n",
      "and close to this is a cave, very pleasant and well-shaded,\n",
      "the sacred terrain of those nymphs who are known as Naiads.\n",
      "Inside it are mixing bowls and two-handled stone jars,\n",
      "105\n",
      "and there too is where the bees deposit their honey.\n",
      "In the cave there are long stone looms, at which the nymphs\n",
      "weave their webs of sea-purple, a wonder to behold.\n",
      "Springs, ever-flowing, are there, and the cave has two entrances,\n",
      "one facing the north wind, accessible to mortals,\n",
      "110\n",
      "but the other, looking southward, is sacred, and men\n",
      "do not use it: it is a pathway for the immortals only.4\n",
      "Here they put in—they knew the place well—and the ship\n",
      "ran half her whole length up the beach, so great was the speed\n",
      "at which she was driven on by the arms of the rowers.\n",
      "115\n",
      "Then, stepping ashore from the well-benched ship, they first\n",
      "lifted Odysseus out of the hollow ship, together\n",
      "with the linen sheet and bright blanket, laid him down,\n",
      "just as he was, on the sand, still fast asleep, and unloaded\n",
      "the goods that the noble Phaiakians had given him, through\n",
      "120\n",
      "great-hearted Athēnē’s prompting, as he set out homeward.\n",
      "These things they left all together by the trunk of the olive tree,\n",
      "away from the path, for fear some other traveler might\n",
      "come upon them and filch them before Odysseus woke up.\n",
      "Then they took off back home. However, the Earth-Shaker\n",
      "125\n",
      "did not forget the threats he’d made earlier against\n",
      "godlike Odysseus, and now he questioned Zeus’ purpose:\n",
      "“Zeus, Father, no longer among the immortal gods\n",
      "shall I be honored, when some mortals respect me not at all—\n",
      "the Phaiakians, even though they share my own ancestry!5\n",
      "130\n",
      "For lately I said that Odysseus would have a heap of trouble\n",
      "before he got home—though I did not wholly deprive him\n",
      "of his return: you’d promised that, sworn with your nod!\n",
      "Yet those men bore him sleeping in their swift ship over the deep,\n",
      "set him down on Ithákē, gave him countless gifts—\n",
      "135\n",
      "bronze, and plentiful gold, and woven garments,\n",
      "more than Odysseus could ever have won from Troy\n",
      "had he come home unscathed, with his fair share of the spoils.”\n",
      "Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Well, wide-powered Earth-Shaker, what a speech that was!\n",
      "140\n",
      "The gods do you no dishonor! A harsh business it would be\n",
      "to assail with demeaning slights our oldest and noblest!\n",
      "But if any mortal, misled by his own forceful power, fails\n",
      "to honor you, you can always be revenged on him hereafter.\n",
      "Do as you wish, whatever gives your heart pleasure.”\n",
      "145\n",
      "Then Poseidōn, Earth-Shaker, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“I’d act at once, dark-clouded one, in the way you describe,\n",
      "but I always dread your wrath, and avoid it. Still, now I’d like,\n",
      "as that so-beautiful vessel of the Phaiakians comes\n",
      "back from its voyage as escort on the misty deep,\n",
      "150\n",
      "to smash it, make them desist, give up this conveyancing\n",
      "of people! And hide their city with a great encircling mountain.\n",
      "Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“My brother, this, to my mind, seems your best way to act:\n",
      "When all the folk from the city are watching that ship\n",
      "155\n",
      "as she puts in, then turn her to stone, very close to land,\n",
      "a stone like the swift ship, so that all mankind may marvel.\n",
      "But don’t6 hide their city with a great encircling mountain.”\n",
      "Now when he heard this, Poseidōn, the Earth-Shaker,\n",
      "went off to Scheria, where the Phaiakians dwell,\n",
      "160\n",
      "and waited there, until that seafaring ship came close\n",
      "inshore, moving fast. Then the Earth-Shaker approached.\n",
      "He turned her to stone, and rooted her deep below\n",
      "with one blow from the flat of his hand. Then he was gone.\n",
      "They exchanged winged words then, one to another, did\n",
      "165\n",
      "the long-oared Phaiakians, men renowned for their ships,\n",
      "and thus would one who’d seen it speak to his neighbor:\n",
      "“Ah me, who was it that fettered our swift ship in the sea\n",
      "on her homeward voyage, when she was in plain sight?”\n",
      "So would one speak. How it happened they had no idea.\n",
      "170\n",
      "But Alkinoös made them a speech on the subject, saying:\n",
      "“Well now, I do recall certain ancient predictions made\n",
      "by my father: he used to say that Poseidōn was angry\n",
      "with us, because we give safe convoy to all and sundry.\n",
      "One day, he said, a most beautiful Phaiakian vessel\n",
      "175\n",
      "returning from escort duty out on the misty deep\n",
      "he’d strike, and hide our city with a great mountain round it.\n",
      "So said the old man, and now this is being fulfilled!\n",
      "So come, let us all agree to do as I bid: we must cease\n",
      "to provide conveyance for mortals, whenever a traveler\n",
      "180\n",
      "visits our city; moreover, we must sacrifice to Poseidōn\n",
      "a dozen choice bulls, that he may have compassion for us\n",
      "and not hide our city with a great encircling mountain.”\n",
      "So he spoke. They were terrified, got the bulls ready,\n",
      "and were all of them busy praying to the lord Poseidōn,\n",
      "185\n",
      "all those leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\n",
      "standing around the altar, when noble Odysseus awoke\n",
      "from sleep in his native land, yet failed to recognize it,\n",
      "so long had he been away; for about him the goddess Pallas\n",
      "Athēnē, Zeus’ daughter, had shed a mist, to make him\n",
      "190\n",
      "unrecognizable when she told him what was going on,\n",
      "and so that neither his wife nor the townsfolk nor his friends\n",
      "would know him until the suitors had paid the full price\n",
      "for their wrongdoing. Thus everything he saw seemed strange\n",
      "to their ruler—the unbroken paths, the bays with safe anchorage,\n",
      "195\n",
      "the steep rocky cliffs, the flourishing trees. So up he got,\n",
      "and stood there, gazing round at his own native land.\n",
      "After a moment he groaned, and struck both thighs\n",
      "with the flat of his hands, and sorrowfully exclaimed:\n",
      "“Alas, to what mortals’ country have I come this time?\n",
      "200\n",
      "Are they wild and savage, devoid of notions of justice,\n",
      "or hospitable to strangers, men with god-fearing minds?\n",
      "Where am I supposed to be taking all this wealth? Where indeed\n",
      "am I wandering to myself? I should have stayed put there with\n",
      "the Phaiakians! Then I’d have met some other mighty king\n",
      "205\n",
      "who’d have befriended me, helped me with my homecoming!\n",
      "Now I’ve no idea where to store this stuff— I can’t leave it here,\n",
      "lest it might become, to my cost, the spoil of others.\n",
      "Not quite so intelligent or right-thinking, then, I reckon,\n",
      "were those leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians who\n",
      "210\n",
      "dumped me in some strange country, when indeed they’d said\n",
      "they would bring me to sunny Ithákē. They failed to do so.\n",
      "May Zeus, the protector of suppliants, requite them,\n",
      "he who watches over mankind, who punishes each wrongdoer!\n",
      "So I’ll count up the items here, examine them well, and see\n",
      "215\n",
      "if they took anything with them in their hollow ship when they left.”\n",
      "That said, he set about counting the surpassingly fine tripods\n",
      "and cauldrons, the gold, the exquisite woven garments.\n",
      "Of these he found nothing missing. But he mourned for his own land\n",
      "as he slouched along its shore by the noisy, many-voiced sea,\n",
      "220\n",
      "with much lamentation. Athēnē now approached him,\n",
      "in the likeness of a young man, a herder of sheep,\n",
      "one delicately nurtured, as are the sons of princes:\n",
      "round her shoulders she wore, double-folded, a well-made wrap,\n",
      "on her sleek feet she had sandals, in her hands a hunting spear.\n",
      "225\n",
      "Odysseus saw her, rejoiced, went up and confronted her,\n",
      "and addressed her with winged words, saying: “Good friend,\n",
      "since you’re the first person I’ve encountered in this country,\n",
      "greetings, and may it be with no evil intent you meet me!\n",
      "No, rather rescue these presents, and rescue me, for to you\n",
      "230\n",
      "I pray now as to a god, I come suppliant to your knees.\n",
      "And tell me this truthfully, so that I can be certain of it:\n",
      "What land, what region is this? What people dwell here?\n",
      "Is it one of the sunny islands, or some promontory, sloping\n",
      "down to the salty deep from the rich-soiled mainland?”\n",
      "235\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“You’re an ignoramus, stranger, or you must come from far away\n",
      "to be asking about this country. It’s very far from being\n",
      "as nameless as all that! Indeed, many people know it,\n",
      "both those who dwell nearer to the dawn and the sun,\n",
      "240\n",
      "and those further behind, out toward the murky darkness.\n",
      "It’s rough terrain, not fit for the driving of horses,\n",
      "Yet not wholly worthless, even if lacking broad plains.\n",
      "Grain grows there abundantly, wine too is a product,\n",
      "there’s always rain and dew to keep it fertile, it’s good\n",
      "245\n",
      "pasture for goats and cattle, there’s also fine ground cover\n",
      "of every sort, together with all-year watering-places.\n",
      "Thus, stranger, the name of Ithákē has spread even to Troy,\n",
      "which, they say, is far distant from the country of Achaia.”\n",
      "So she spoke. Noble much-enduring Odysseus was glad,\n",
      "250\n",
      "taking joy in the land of his fathers as he heard the words\n",
      "of Pallas Athēnē, the daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus;\n",
      "and he spoke, addressed her with winged words, yet did not\n",
      "tell her the truth, held back his actual story,\n",
      "making up as he went a plausible tale in his mind:\n",
      "255\n",
      "“I did hear tell of Ithákē, even when in broad Krētē,\n",
      "far away over the deep, and now I myself have come here\n",
      "bringing these goods of mine. I left as much more with my sons,\n",
      "and I’m on the run, after killing a son of Idomeneus—\n",
      "swift-footed Orsilochos, who in broad Krētē surpassed\n",
      "260\n",
      "for fleetness of foot all bread-earning men—because\n",
      "he meant to deprive me of the plunder I’d won from Troy,\n",
      "(to get which I’d suffered much agony, battling through\n",
      "both the wars of men and the high seas), because I’d refused\n",
      "to do his father a favor by serving as his henchman\n",
      "265\n",
      "in the land of Troy, while commanding other troops of my own.\n",
      "So I ran him through with my bronze-tipped spear as he came\n",
      "back from the fields. I lay in wait for him at the roadside\n",
      "with one companion. A dark night obscured the sky:\n",
      "nobody saw us. Unperceived, I robbed him of life.\n",
      "270\n",
      "But when I’d dispatched him with the sharp bronze, I went\n",
      "at once to the lordly Phoenicians’ ship, besought them—\n",
      "giving them plunder enough to satisfy their desire—\n",
      "to take me on board as a passenger, land me at Pylos,\n",
      "or noble Ēlis, where the Epeians hold power.\n",
      "275\n",
      "But gale-force winds forced them away from there, though much\n",
      "against their will: they had no plan to deceive me.\n",
      "So, beaten off course by weather, we arrived here at night,\n",
      "and quickly rowed into the harbor, nor did any among us\n",
      "think at all about supper, though we needed it badly,\n",
      "280\n",
      "but just as we were, after landing, we all lay down, and sweet\n",
      "sleep descended upon me in my exhaustion. But they\n",
      "removed all my goods from the hollow ship, and put them\n",
      "close to where I was lying, there on the sand, and then\n",
      "themselves went aboard and departed for populous Sidon,\n",
      "285\n",
      "while I was left behind here, grieving at heart.”\n",
      "So he spoke.\n",
      "The goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, smiled and stroked him\n",
      "with one hand, and changed her appearance into the likeness\n",
      "of a tall and beautiful woman, one skilled in fine handiwork,\n",
      "and spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Sharp\n",
      "290\n",
      "and guileful he’d need to be, the man who’d outsmart you\n",
      "in every trick, were it even a god who met you! Perverse,\n",
      "devious-minded, obsessed with deceit, won’t you ever,\n",
      "even in your own country, abandon your deceptions\n",
      "and the lying tales you adore from the very ground up? But let’s\n",
      "295\n",
      "speak no more of these things—we’re experts both\n",
      "in craftiness: you are the best of all living mortals\n",
      "for counsel and storytelling, while I among all the gods\n",
      "am famed for contrivance and sharpness. You failed to recognize\n",
      "Zeus’ daughter Pallas Athēnē—I who always stand\n",
      "300\n",
      "at your side, I who guard you in all your tough endeavors—\n",
      "and made sure that you were befriended by all the Phaiakians!\n",
      "Now I have come once more to weave a new plan with you,\n",
      "to hide all these treasures which the lordly Phaiakians\n",
      "gave you for your homecoming—by my plan and urging!—\n",
      "305\n",
      "and to tell you all the troubles it’s your destiny to endure\n",
      "in your well-built home. And endure them you must, not reveal\n",
      "to anyone, man or woman, that in fact it’s you,\n",
      "come back from your wanderings, but silently endure\n",
      "a host of indignities, submit to men’s violent acts.”\n",
      "310\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“It’s hard for a mortal, goddess, to recognize you on meeting,\n",
      "however clever he is: you can assume any likeness!\n",
      "But this I know well, you were kindly disposed toward me\n",
      "back when we sons of Achaians were fighting at Troy.\n",
      "315\n",
      "But after we’d sacked the steep citadel of Priam,\n",
      "and left in our ships, and some god then scattered the Achaians,\n",
      "never since then, Zeus’ daughter, have I seen you, or observed\n",
      "you boarding my ship, to ward off some trouble from me!\n",
      "It was indeed burdened with a torn heart in my breast\n",
      "320\n",
      "that I kept wandering on, until the gods rescued me\n",
      "from my troubles—until, indeed, in the Phaiakians’ rich land\n",
      "you cheered me with your words, yourself led me to their city!\n",
      "Now in your father’s name I entreat you—for I don’t\n",
      "think it’s to sunny Ithákē I’ve come, but some other\n",
      "325\n",
      "country I find myself in, and that this assertion of yours\n",
      "was spoken in mockery, to deceive my mind—please tell me\n",
      "whether in fact or not it’s my native land I’ve come to.”\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“You always have some such idea in your head! That’s why\n",
      "330\n",
      "I cannot abandon you in your unhappiness. Besides,\n",
      "you’re courteous, sharp-witted, discreet. Any other man\n",
      "would gladly, on getting back after his wanderings,\n",
      "have hurried home to see his wife and children; but you\n",
      "aren’t willing to ascertain anything or to make enquiries\n",
      "335\n",
      "until you’ve made trial of your wife, who, now as always,\n",
      "sits in your halls, while for her the long nights and days\n",
      "waste away slowly in sorrow with the tears she sheds.\n",
      "But this I never doubted, and in my heart knew well—\n",
      "that you’d make it home after losing all your comrades.\n",
      "340\n",
      "Still, I wasn’t ready to quarrel on your behalf with Poseidōn,\n",
      "my father’s brother, who nursed a grudge in his heart\n",
      "against you, enraged because you blinded his dear son.\n",
      "But come now, I’ll show you the realm of Ithákē, convince you!\n",
      "This is the harbor of Phorkys, the Old Man of the Sea,\n",
      "345\n",
      "and here, at the head of the harbor, is the long-leafed olive tree,\n",
      "and close to it the cave, very pleasant and well-shaded,\n",
      "the sacred terrain of those nymphs who are known as Naiads.\n",
      "This is the high-roofed cave where you used to honor\n",
      "those nymphs with so many rich sacrifices; and yonder\n",
      "350\n",
      "forest-clad mountain is Nēriton.”\n",
      "That said, the goddess\n",
      "dispersed the mist, and the landscape stood out clearly.\n",
      "Then glad indeed was long-suffering noble Odysseus,\n",
      "and rejoiced in his country, and kissed the grain-giving earth,\n",
      "and at once, raising up his hands, made a prayer to the nymphs:\n",
      "355\n",
      "“You Naiad nymphs, Zeus’ daughters, never once did I\n",
      "think that I’d see you again! But now with friendly prayers\n",
      "I greet you—and gifts I shall give you, as I used to do,\n",
      "should Zeus’ daughter, leader of hosts, be willing to let me\n",
      "live on myself, and to bring my own dear son to manhood.”\n",
      "360\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Be confident, don’t let these matters bother your mind! And now\n",
      "let’s store your goods right away in the furthest recess\n",
      "of the sacred cave, where they’ll always be safe for you,\n",
      "and ourselves plan how all may turn out for the best.”\n",
      "So saying,\n",
      "365\n",
      "the goddess made her way into the shadowy cave,\n",
      "searching through it for hiding places, while Odysseus\n",
      "brought all his treasures inside—the gold, the unworn bronze,\n",
      "and the finely made clothing that the Phaiakians gave him.\n",
      "These things he stowed well away, and Pallas Athēnē,\n",
      "370\n",
      "daughter of Zeus of the aegis, set a stone at the entrance.\n",
      "Then they both sat down by the trunk of the sacred olive,\n",
      "and discussed how to wreak destruction on the arrogant suitors.\n",
      "The goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, began the discussion, saying:\n",
      "“Scion of Zeus, Laërtēs’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "375\n",
      "take thought how to lay hands on these shameless suitors\n",
      "who for three years now have been lording it in your halls—\n",
      "courting your godlike wife, pressing wooers’ gifts upon her,\n",
      "while she, heart yearning sadly for your return, gives hope\n",
      "to all, making promises to every last man of them,\n",
      "380\n",
      "and sending them messages. But her mind is on other things.”\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Indeed, I was like to have met the same evil fate\n",
      "in my halls as did Agamemnōn, son of Atreus,\n",
      "had you not told me, goddess, the whole truth of the matter!\n",
      "385\n",
      "So come now, weave me a scheme of revenge upon these men,\n",
      "and yourself stand by my side, fill me with strength\n",
      "and daring, as when we undid the bright diadem of Troy!\n",
      "Were you, grey-eyed goddess, beside me, hot to fight,\n",
      "I’d take on, with you, three hundred warriors, O my\n",
      "390\n",
      "sovereign goddess, given your free and ready support.”\n",
      "The goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Assuredly I shall stand by you: you will not go unnoticed\n",
      "when we are about this business: your broad floor, I think,\n",
      "will be splashed with the blood and brains of more than one\n",
      "395\n",
      "of those suitors who are now devouring your livelihood!\n",
      "First, let me make you unrecognizable to any mortal:\n",
      "I’ll shrivel the healthy flesh on your supple limbs,\n",
      "destroy the fair hair on your head,7 wrap you in rags so foul\n",
      "as to make the mere sight of a man who’s clad in them disgusting;\n",
      "400\n",
      "and I’ll dim your eyes, that before were so attractive,\n",
      "to make you look really shabby to all these suitors—\n",
      "and to your wife, and the son you left behind in your halls.\n",
      "Now what you must do first of all is seek out the swineherd—\n",
      "he looks after your pigs, but also is well disposed toward you,\n",
      "405\n",
      "and loves your son, and discreet Penelopē. Him you’ll find\n",
      "stationed along with his pigs. These are out at pasture\n",
      "close to the Raven’s Rock and the spring of Arethousa,\n",
      "feeding on plentiful acorns and drinking dark spring water,\n",
      "those things that nourish the abundant fat of swine.\n",
      "410\n",
      "Stay there, and sitting by him, ask all your questions.\n",
      "I meanwhile shall go to Sparta, land of fair women,\n",
      "and summon Tēlemachos—your dear son, Odysseus—\n",
      "who went to broad Lakedaimōn to visit Menelaös\n",
      "and enquire about you, find out if you were still alive.”\n",
      "415\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Why didn’t you tell him, you whose mind is all-knowing?\n",
      "Was it so he too might suffer hardships traversing\n",
      "the unharvested sea, while others devour his livelihood?”\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "420\n",
      "“Don’t let him be too heavy a weight upon your mind!\n",
      "It was I who directed him, so he’d get a good reputation\n",
      "by going there! He’s suffered no hardship, he’s relaxing\n",
      "in the house of Atreus’ son, enjoys his limitless bounty.\n",
      "There are young men lying in wait for him in their black ship,\n",
      "425\n",
      "eager to kill him before he gets back to his native land;\n",
      "but I don’t see it happening. Before that the earth will cover\n",
      "one or more of the suitors now devouring your livelihood.”\n",
      "So saying, Athēnē began touching him with her wand.\n",
      "She shriveled the healthy flesh on his supple limbs,\n",
      "430\n",
      "destroyed the fair hair on his head, and over his whole\n",
      "person now stretched the skin of an old and age-worn man.\n",
      "She dimmed his eyes, that before were so attractive,\n",
      "and changed his clothes to a ragged cloak and tunic,\n",
      "all threadbare and filthy, begrimed with foul black smoke;\n",
      "435\n",
      "and round him she cast the great hide of a speedy deer,\n",
      "bald of its hair, and gave him a staff, and a leather bag\n",
      "tattered and rent, that was held by a twisted cord.\n",
      "Plans made, the two of them parted. The goddess now left\n",
      "for lordly Lakedaimōn, in search of Odysseus’ son.\n",

      "But the rough path up from the harbor was that which Odysseus\n",
      "now took, by the woodland and heights, to where Athēnē\n",
      "said he’d find the noble swineherd, who, of all the household\n",
      "Odysseus possessed, devoted most care to his property.\n",
      "Ensconced in his forecourt he found him, where the enclosure\n",
      "5\n",
      "had been built up high, at a point with a wide view round,\n",
      "a fine big open courtyard, in a sheltered position. This\n",
      "the swineherd had built himself, unknown to his mistress\n",
      "or old Laërtēs, for the pigs of his absent master, using\n",
      "quarried stones, topped off with a coping of prickly thorn.\n",
      "10\n",
      "Outside he’d driven in posts, right round in a circle,\n",
      "strong and close, splitting them off from an oak’s dark center;\n",
      "inside the enclosure he’d fashioned a dozen sties\n",
      "set close to each other, to serve as beds for the pigs:\n",
      "in each of them fifty ground-sleeping swine were penned.\n",
      "These were sows, for breeding; the boars bedded down outside,\n",
      "15\n",
      "and were fewer by far in number, for the godlike suitors\n",
      "made inroads on them for feasting. The swineherd always\n",
      "sent them the best of the fattened hogs: there were\n",
      "three hundred and sixty of these, and there slept beside them\n",
      "20\n",
      "four guard dogs, as savage as wild beasts, specially reared\n",
      "by the swineherd, leader of men. He himself was now busy\n",
      "making a pair of sandals and fitting them to his feet,\n",
      "cutting a piece of fresh-colored oxhide. The others\n",
      "had gone off, one here, one there, with their droves of swine—\n",
      "25\n",
      "three of them, that is: the fourth he’d sent into town\n",
      "with a hog, taken under constraint, to the arrogant suitors,\n",
      "for them to slaughter and glut their appetites with the meat.\n",
      "Odysseus was suddenly spotted by the ferocious guard dogs,\n",
      "and they made for him, barking loudly. Odysseus, however,\n",
      "30\n",
      "showing presence of mind, sat down, letting go of his staff.\n",
      "Yet there on his own farmstead he might have been badly hurt\n",
      "had the swineherd not run up quickly, chasing the dogs\n",
      "across the forecourt, dropping his oxhide as he came,\n",
      "and, shouting loudly, had scattered them this way and that\n",
      "35\n",
      "with volleys of stones. He then addressed his master, saying:\n",
      "“Old man, those dogs came so close to tearing you apart\n",
      "in an instant, and you would have put the blame on me!\n",
      "And the gods have brought on me other griefs and sorrows:\n",
      "For I sit here lamenting, and mourning a godlike master\n",
      "40\n",
      "and fattening up these hogs for other men to devour,\n",
      "while he may now be adrift, half-starved and in need of food,\n",
      "in some town or country of aliens, foreign of speech—\n",
      "that is, if he’s still alive, and enjoying the sunlight!\n",
      "But come indoors with me now, old man, and after\n",
      "45\n",
      "you’ve quietened your heart with food and wine, you too\n",
      "can relate where you’re from, all the hardships you’ve endured.”\n",
      "So saying, the noble1 swineherd escorted him to his hut,\n",
      "ushered him in, heaped up thick rough brushwood, and on it\n",
      "spread the hide of a shaggy wild goat for him to sit on—\n",
      "50\n",
      "his own coverlet, large and hairy—and Odysseus was pleased\n",
      "at being given such a good welcome, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“My host,2 may Zeus and the other immortal gods now grant you\n",
      "what you most desire, since you gave me a ready welcome.”\n",
      "To him then, swineherd Eumaios, did you make answer, saying:\n",
      "55\n",
      "“Stranger, were one even meaner than you to come here,\n",
      "I’d still have no right to reject him, for all strangers and beggars\n",
      "are from Zeus, and a gift, however small, is friendly\n",
      "from folk such as us; for that’s always the lot of servants,\n",
      "frightened when those who have the mastery over them\n",
      "60\n",
      "are the young. The gods, it’s true, have blocked that man’s return\n",
      "who’d have treated me as a friend, would have given me possessions—\n",
      "a home, a plot of land, a much-courted wife, such things\n",
      "as a kind-hearted master gives to a servant of his\n",
      "who works hard for him, whose labor a god makes prosper\n",
      "65\n",
      "just as this work prospers to which I’m now committed.\n",
      "For me my lord would have done much, had he grown old here;\n",
      "but he perished, as I now wish Helen’s whole line had perished,\n",
      "utterly, she who unstrung the knees of so many men!\n",
      "For he too went out there to save Agamemnōn’s honor,\n",
      "70\n",
      "to Ilion, rich in good horses, to fight against the Trojans.”\n",
      "So saying, he quickly girded his tunic with a belt,\n",
      "and went out to the sties, where the droves of pigs were confined.\n",
      "From there he chose two, brought them in, and killed them both,\n",
      "singed them and cut them up and put the meat on spits,\n",
      "75\n",
      "and roasted it. Then he placed the cuts, hot and still spitted,\n",
      "with a sprinkling of white barley, in front of Odysseus.\n",
      "In an ivy-wood bowl he now mixed the honey-sweet wine,\n",
      "and sat down facing his guest, and addressed him invitingly:\n",
      "“Eat now, stranger! Enjoy the food that’s the fare for servants—\n",
      "80\n",
      "cheap pork! The fattened hogs are kept for the suitors’ meals,\n",
      "men whose minds care nothing for the gods’ wrath, or for pity.\n",
      "The blessed gods do not favor reckless deeds, but rather\n",
      "have rewards for justice and for men’s righteous deeds.\n",
      "Even the hostile and lawless, who invade the land of others\n",
      "85\n",
      "to get a living, and Zeus allows them their plunder, so that\n",
      "they sail home with laden vessels—on their minds too\n",
      "falls the strong fear of the gods’ wrath. But these men here\n",
      "must know something, must have had some word from a god\n",
      "about his sorry death, since they will not court properly\n",
      "90\n",
      "or go back to their own possessions, but here at their ease\n",
      "waste our goods wantonly, and restraint there is none,\n",
      "for on every night and day that we get from Zeus they never\n",
      "sacrifice just one victim, or even two, I think,\n",
      "and our wine they waste, consuming it recklessly.\n",
      "95\n",
      "Great indeed, past telling, were his resources: no other\n",
      "heroic warrior, either away on the dark mainland,\n",
      "or on Ithákē itself, could match them. Not twenty men\n",
      "together had as much wealth: I’ll list you the sum of it.\n",
      "On the mainland, twelve herds of cattle, twelve flocks of sheep,\n",
      "100\n",
      "as many droves of swine and wide-ranging troops of goats\n",
      "are pastured alike by outsiders and his own herdsmen.\n",
      "Eleven wide-ranging troops of goats browse at the farthest\n",
      "end of the island, and over them good men watch,\n",
      "each of whom daily drives off one of his troop for them—\n",
      "105\n",
      "whichever fattened goat looks to be the best that he has.\n",
      "Myself, I guard and watch over these swine here, and choose\n",
      "the best of the hogs to provide for them.”\n",
      "So he spoke.\n",
      "His grateful guest was already downing the meat and wine\n",
      "greedily, in silence, planning trouble for the suitors.\n",
      "110\n",
      "But when he’d had supper, and quietened his heart by eating,\n",
      "the swineherd topped up with wine the bowl from which\n",
      "he himself drank, and gave it him; he took it, glad at heart,\n",
      "and spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Friend,\n",
      "who was the man that bought you with his resources,\n",
      "115\n",
      "one as wealthy and powerful as you mentioned? You say\n",
      "he perished upholding the honor of Agamemnōn: tell me,\n",
      "since such a person I may perhaps recognize;\n",
      "for only Zeus and the other immortal gods may know\n",
      "whether I’ve seen and had news of him: much I’ve wandered.”\n",
      "120\n",
      "The swineherd, leader of men, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Old man, no wanderer who turned up with news of him\n",
      "would ever convince his wife and son: far from it!\n",
      "Vagrant fellows in need of comfort and sustenance\n",
      "tell lies: they have no desire to offer a true account!\n",
      "125\n",
      "Anyone who in his wandering stops off at Ithákē\n",
      "goes straight to my mistress and spins her a lying yarn;\n",
      "and she entertains him kindly and questions him in detail,\n",
      "while shedding tears of sorrow from beneath her eyelids,\n",
      "as a woman will do when her husband has perished far away.\n",
      "130\n",
      "You too, old man, would be quick to concoct a story\n",
      "If someone gave you for it a cloak and tunic to wear!\n",
      "As for him, by now the dogs and swift birds of prey\n",
      "will have torn the skin from his bones, and the soul’s gone from him,\n",
      "or fish in the deep sea have eaten him, and his bones\n",
      "135\n",
      "are now down under the sands of some mainland beach.\n",
      "So he’s perished out there, and on his friends hereafter—\n",
      "all, but on me most of all—grief’s been laid, for never again\n",
      "will I find so kindly a master, however far I go,\n",
      "not even if I went back to my parents’ home, the place\n",
      "140\n",
      "where I was born, and they raised me themselves. Yet it’s not\n",
      "so much for them that I grieve—much though I now long\n",
      "to set eyes on them again, to be in my own country—\n",
      "no, it’s Odysseus for whom I yearn, and he’s gone!\n",
      "To speak his name, stranger, even when he’s absent, I find\n",
      "145\n",
      "presumptuous,3 since he always loved and cared for me greatly:\n",
      "‘Honored master’ I rather call him, even though he’s far away.”\n",
      "Much-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Friend, since yours is a total denial, since you don’t believe\n",
      "that man will ever come back, and your heart’s still incredulous,\n",
      "150\n",
      "then I’ll not just make a plain statement, but swear an oath to it\n",
      "that Odysseus will return! I claim the reward for good news\n",
      "the moment that man sets foot inside his home—then clothe me\n",
      "in a cloak and a tunic, fine garments! But until then,\n",
      "however sore my need, I would not accept anything;\n",
      "155\n",
      "for as hateful to me as the gates of Hadēs is the man\n",
      "who, yielding to poverty, concocts a deceitful story.\n",
      "Zeus, first among gods, be my witness, and this guest’s table,\n",
      "and the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\n",
      "that all these things indeed will come to pass as I tell you!\n",
      "160\n",
      "Within the current moon’s sequence Odysseus will arrive here,\n",
      "between this month’s waning and the rising of the next.\n",
      "He will come back home, and take vengeance on all those\n",
      "here who dishonor his wife and his illustrious son.”\n",
      "To him then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n",
      "165\n",
      "“Neither shall I pay you this reward for good news, old man,\n",
      "nor will Odysseus ever come home, so relax and drink,\n",
      "and let’s think about other matters—don’t remind me of these!\n",
      "The heart in my breast suffers agonies whenever\n",
      "anyone mentions my caring master. As for your oath,\n",
      "170\n",
      "we’ll let that ride: may Odysseus indeed come back,\n",
      "as I hope and desire, as indeed does Penelopē too,\n",
      "and aged Laërtēs, and godlike Tēlemachos. Now\n",
      "it’s for him I ceaselessly grieve, the son Odysseus begot:\n",
      "Tēlemachos. Him the gods bred up like a sapling: I thought\n",
      "175\n",
      "he’d grow to be no worse a man among men\n",
      "than his own dear father, a marvel in form and looks.\n",
      "But some immortal damaged the common sense within him,\n",
      "or maybe some human: he went after news of his father\n",
      "to sacred Pylos, and now the lordly suitors are lying\n",
      "180\n",
      "in wait for him on his way home, that Arkeisios’ godlike\n",
      "line may die out on Ithákē, leave no name behind.\n",
      "But we’ll leave him be now, whether he’s to be ambushed\n",
      "or escape with a helping hand from the son of Kronos.\n",
      "Come now, old sir, inform me about your own misfortunes,\n",
      "185\n",
      "and make it a truthful account, one that I can rely on!\n",
      "Who are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\n",
      "What kind of ship did you come on? And how did sailors\n",
      "bring you here to Ithákē? And who did they claim to be?\n",
      "For I don’t imagine you made your way here on foot.”\n",
      "190\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Very well, I’ll give you a truthful account of these matters.\n",
      "I only wish that we two had enough supplies of food\n",
      "and sweet wine, here in your hut, enough to last a while,\n",
      "that we could feast on in silence, while others did the work:\n",
      "195\n",
      "easily then could I take up the space of a whole year\n",
      "and still not have finished the tale of my heartfelt sufferings—\n",
      "sum total of all that by the gods’ will I’ve endured.\n",
      "“From broad Krētē, I claim, derives my family background:\n",
      "I’m the son of a wealthy man, and numerous other\n",
      "200\n",
      "offspring were born and raised in his halls, legitimate\n",
      "sons of his wife; but the mother who bore me was bought,\n",
      "a concubine. Yet he honored me like his true-born sons,\n",
      "did Kastōr, the son of Hylax, from whom I claim descent,\n",
      "and who was revered like a god by the Krētans in their land\n",
      "205\n",
      "for his wealth and prosperity, his splendid sons. But still\n",
      "the spirits of death pounced on him and carried him off\n",
      "to the house of Hadēs. His property was divided\n",
      "by his arrogant sons, who cast lots for it. But to me\n",
      "they allotted a small portion only, house and all.\n",
      "210\n",
      "Yet I married a wife from a wealthy landowning family\n",
      "on the grounds of my excellence: I was no good-for-nothing,\n",
      "no coward in battle. Now all that strength is gone,\n",
      "though I think when you look at the stubble you’ll recognize\n",
      "what the grain once was. Since then I’ve suffered greatly.\n",
      "215\n",
      "In the past Athēnē and Arēs endowed me with courage\n",
      "and rank-breaking strength: whenever I chose for an ambush\n",
      "our best men, sowing the seeds of trouble for the foe,\n",
      "never did my proud spirit anticipate death: no, I\n",
      "was always the first to spring forward, and with my spear\n",
      "220\n",
      "to lay low any opponent who lacked my speed of foot.\n",
      "Such a man was I in warfare. Field work was not to my taste,\n",
      "nor was running a household—the way to raise fine children.\n",
      "Oared vessels were always my passion—that, and warfare,\n",
      "arrows and well-polished javelins—deadly objects,\n",
      "225\n",
      "to which others, more often than not, react with a shudder;\n",
      "but to me were welcome: maybe a god endeared them to me,\n",
      "and different men take pleasure in different actions.\n",
      "For before the Achaians’ sons set foot in the land of Troy\n",
      "I had nine times commanded troops and swift-sailing ships\n",
      "230\n",
      "against foreign fighters. Much plunder kept coming my way,\n",
      "of which I chose what I fancied, and plenty afterwards\n",
      "I obtained by lot. At once my house grew rich: thenceforward\n",
      "I became respected and feared among the Krētans.\n",
      "“But when\n",
      "far-seeing Zeus devised that hateful expedition\n",
      "235\n",
      "which unstrung the knees of so many warriors, then\n",
      "they ordered me, together with far-famed Idomeneus,\n",
      "to lead ships to Ilion, nor was there any device\n",
      "that would let us refuse, for the people’s stern will compelled us.\n",
      "There for nine years we Achaians’ sons were at war,\n",
      "240\n",
      "but on the tenth we sacked Priam’s citadel, and set out\n",
      "for home in our ships. A god then scattered the Achaians,\n",
      "and for wretched me Zeus the planner thought up more trouble.\n",
      "One month I stayed home, taking pleasure in my children\n",
      "and wedded wife and possessions. But after that\n",
      "245\n",
      "to Egypt my spirit drove me to make a voyage,\n",
      "in ships that were well appointed, with my godlike comrades.\n",
      "Nine ships I fitted out, and their crews assembled quickly.\n",
      "For six days on end my trusty comrades feasted,\n",
      "and I provided them with victims in plenty, so they\n",
      "250\n",
      "could sacrifice to the gods and have a feast themselves;\n",
      "then on the seventh we boarded, sailed out from broad Krētē,\n",
      "running on before a strong wind out of the north,\n",
      "lightly, as though downstream: nor did any misfortune\n",
      "befall my vessels: unscathed and free from sickness\n",
      "255\n",
      "we sat there, while the wind and the helmsmen steered them.\n",
      "“On the fifth day we reached Egypt’s fine-flowing stream\n",
      "and in that Egyptian river I anchored my curved vessels.\n",
      "Then I issued orders to my trusty comrades, to remain\n",
      "there with the ships, and to be those ships’ protectors\n",
      "260\n",
      "while I sent off scouts to find and man lookout posts.\n",
      "But, trusting their strength, they yielded to wanton aggression,\n",
      "and at once began ravaging the Egyptians’ splendid\n",
      "fields, and carrying off their wives and little children,\n",
      "and killing the men. Word quickly reached the city,\n",
      "265\n",
      "and, hearing the shouting, people came out at daybreak.\n",
      "The whole plain filled up with infantry and horses\n",
      "and the bright glint of bronze. Zeus, hurler of thunderbolts,\n",
      "cast a craven panic upon my comrades: nobody dared\n",
      "to stand firm and face the foe, for trouble confronted us\n",
      "270\n",
      "on every side. Many of us they slew with the sharp bronze;\n",
      "others they led off alive, to do forced labor for them.\n",
      "But Zeus himself put this thought in my mind—how I wished\n",
      "I had suffered death and encountered my destiny there\n",
      "In Egypt, since yet more sorrow was waiting to welcome me!\n",
      "275\n",
      "At once I removed from my head the well-wrought helmet,\n",
      "and the shield from my shoulders, and let fall my spear,\n",
      "and made my way toward the horses of the king,\n",
      "and clasped his knees and kissed them. He rescued and pitied me,\n",
      "picked me up in his chariot, took me, weeping, to his home.\n",
      "280\n",
      "Numerous fighters ran at me with their ash-wood spears,\n",
      "eager to kill me, for they were greatly angered;\n",
      "but he warded them off, in concern for the wrath of Zeus,\n",
      "the strangers’ protector, the stern requiter of evil deeds.\n",
      "“I stayed there for seven years, during which I acquired\n",
      "285\n",
      "great wealth from the men of Egypt, for they all gave me gifts.\n",
      "But when the eighth year came round for me, there appeared\n",
      "a man, a Phoenician, a fine expert in deceptions,\n",
      "a sharp nibbler, who already had cheated many people.\n",
      "By his cunning he talked me into accompanying him\n",
      "290\n",
      "to Phoenicia, where were located his home and his possessions,\n",
      "and there I stayed with him till a year had run its course.\n",
      "But when at length the months and days were completed\n",
      "Of the circling year, and the seasons in turn came on,\n",
      "he put me aboard a seagoing ship bound for Libya,\n",
      "295\n",
      "with a lying tale that we’d both be conveying a cargo,\n",
      "but in fact to sell me there for a high price. I went with him\n",
      "on the ship, though suspecting trouble, under constraint.\n",
      "She ran on before a strong wind out of the north,\n",
      "above central Krētē; but Zeus was planning their destruction,\n",
      "300\n",
      "and when we’d left Krētē behind us, and there was no other\n",
      "land in plain view, but nothing save sky and sea,\n",
      "then the son of Kronos conjured up a black cloud\n",
      "over our hollow ship, and the deep beneath it darkened.\n",
      "Zeus with a clap of thunder hurled his bolt at our vessel:\n",
      "305\n",
      "she shuddered her whole length, struck by the bolt of Zeus,\n",
      "and was filled with the reek of sulfur. The crew all fell overboard,\n",
      "and like shearwaters went bobbing around our black ship,\n",
      "borne up by the waves. The god deprived them of their return.\n",
      "But for me, in my heartfelt distress, Zeus himself at this moment\n",
      "310\n",
      "put into my hands the sea-going vessel’s great mast,\n",
      "so that once more I might escape destruction. And so,\n",
      "clinging firmly to this, I was carried away by fierce winds\n",
      "for nine days, but on the tenth, in the blackness of night,\n",
      "a great wave rolled me ashore in Thesprōtian country.\n",
      "315\n",
      "There the Thesprōtian king, the hero Pheidōn,\n",
      "cared for me without payment, for his son now found me\n",
      "overcome by chill air and exhaustion, and took me home,\n",
      "leading me by the hand, till he reached his father’s abode,\n",
      "and gave me clothing, a mantle and tunic. It was there\n",
      "320\n",
      "that I heard news of Odysseus, for the king now told me\n",
      "he’d befriended and entertained him on his way to his native land,\n",
      "and showed me all the possessions Odysseus had amassed—\n",
      "bronze and gold, and iron, laboriously wrought,\n",
      "enough to support his descendants to the tenth generation,\n",
      "325\n",
      "so great was the wealth stored for him there in the king’s domain.\n",
      "But Odysseus, he said, had gone to Dōdōnē, to discover,\n",
      "from the deep-leaved sacred oak, what Zeus was planning,\n",
      "and how he should make his way back to Ithákē’s rich land\n",
      "after so long an absence, whether openly or in secret.\n",
      "330\n",
      "And he swore to me at home, while pouring libations,\n",
      "that the ship had been launched, and the crew were in readiness\n",
      "to convey him to his own country. But me he sent off first,\n",
      "since there chanced to be a Thesprōtian vessel ready\n",
      "to set sail for Doulichion, that country rich in wheat.\n",
      "335\n",
      "He told them to ferry me there, to King Akastos, with proper\n",
      "care; but an evil plan had found favor in their hearts\n",
      "about me, so I’d still suffer at misery’s nadir. When\n",
      "the seagoing vessel had sailed a fair way from land, at once\n",
      "they set about making ready the day of slavery for me.\n",
      "340\n",
      "My clothing, my mantle and tunic, they stripped off from me,\n",
      "and replaced them with the vile rags and tattered tunic\n",
      "that you can see now in front of you. That same evening\n",
      "they reached the tilled fields of sunny Ithákē. Then\n",
      "they left me bound fast in the well-benched ship with a rope\n",
      "345\n",
      "that they’d twisted tight, and themselves went off ashore,\n",
      "and hastened to take their supper there on the seashore.\n",
      "But the gods themselves took care of me, untied the knots\n",
      "easily. Wrapping the rags around my head, I slid down\n",
      "the polished gangplank, plunged breast first into the sea,\n",
      "350\n",
      "struck out with both arms, swimming fast, and very quickly\n",
      "got back ashore, well away from where they were.\n",
      "Then I went up and found a coppice in full bloom,\n",
      "and lay cowering there, while they, complaining loudly,\n",
      "went searching around; but when it seemed quite hopeless\n",
      "355\n",
      "to go on looking, they went back and reembarked\n",
      "on their hollow ship. The gods themselves kept me hidden\n",
      "easily, then brought me safe here to the farmstead\n",
      "of an understanding man. So, it’s still my fate to live.”\n",
      "To him then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n",
      "360\n",
      "“Ah, wretched stranger, indeed you stirred my heart deeply\n",
      "with your detailed tale of how much you suffered and wandered!\n",
      "But one part was not, I think, right, nor will you convince me—\n",
      "what you said of Odysseus. Why should a man such as you\n",
      "tell a pointless lie? Apropos my lord’s homecoming,\n",
      "365\n",
      "this I know well: he got himself so hated by all the gods\n",
      "that they would not allow his life to end among the Trojans\n",
      "or in the arms of his friends, after winding up the war.\n",
      "Then all the Achaians would have raised him a burial mound,\n",
      "and great glory would have been his, and his son’s, hereafter.\n",
      "370\n",
      "But now, ingloriously, the storm winds have swept him away.\n",
      "I stay out here with the pigs, I don’t go into town,\n",
      "except those times when prudent Penelopē wants me,\n",
      "when news has reached her from somewhere or other—then\n",
      "folk sit round and keep querying every detail,\n",
      "375\n",
      "both those who grieve for their lord who’s been so long gone,\n",
      "and those who enjoy eating up his livelihood for free.\n",
      "But I haven’t fancied this business of questioning and enquiries\n",
      "ever since a certain Aitōlian deceived me with his story.\n",
      "He was someone who’d killed a man: after wandering far\n",
      "380\n",
      "he appeared at my house, and I gave him a friendly welcome.\n",
      "He’d seen him, he said, with the Krētans in Idomeneus’ company,\n",
      "repairing his ships, severely battered by storms. He assured me\n",
      "Odysseus would be back here by summer or harvesttime,\n",
      "bringing much treasure, both he and his godlike comrades!\n",
      "385\n",
      "And you, grief-struck old man, since some god led you to me,\n",
      "don’t try to please me with lies, or to charm me in any way:\n",
      "That’s not why I shall respect and befriend you, but through fear\n",
      "of Zeus, god of strangers, and because I feel pity for you.”\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "390\n",
      "“The spirit you have in your breast is indeed distrustful,\n",
      "one not to be won or persuaded even by my sworn oath!\n",
      "Come, then, let’s make an agreement, to which hereafter\n",
      "the gods who hold Olympos can bear witness for us both:\n",
      "If your master does in fact return to this house of his,\n",
      "395\n",
      "then give me a mantle and tunic to wear, and send me\n",
      "on to Doulichion, which is where my heart’s set on going;\n",
      "but if your master does not come back home—as I tell you\n",
      "he will—set your servants on me, have me thrown off a high cliff,\n",
      "as a warning to other beggars against telling lying tales.”\n",
      "400\n",
      "Then the noble swineherd responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, that way I’d win a fine reputation for virtue\n",
      "among men, both today and in time to come, were I,\n",
      "who brought you into my hut and entertained you,\n",
      "then to kill you, deprive you of the dear breath of life!\n",
      "405\n",
      "Very ready I’d be then to pray to Kronos’ son Zeus!\n",
      "But now it’s time for supper. My comrades should very soon\n",
      "be home, so we can make a tasty meal in the hut.”\n",
      "While the two thus conversed, the one with the other, the pigs\n",
      "and the men who were herding them now drew near. The sows\n",
      "410\n",
      "they shut up for the night in their accustomed sties,\n",
      "and a vast clamor arose from the pigs as they were penned.\n",
      "Then the noble swineherd called to his comrades, saying:\n",
      "‘‘Fetch out the best of the hogs, so I can slaughter it\n",
      "for the stranger—he’s traveled far—and we’ll share it too,\n",
      "415\n",
      "who have all the trouble of tending these white-tusked swine\n",
      "while others devour our labor and pay nothing for it.”\n",
      "So saying, he split up wood with the pitiless bronze,\n",
      "while the others brought in a five-year-old fattened hog\n",
      "and set him down by the hearth. Nor did the swineherd\n",
      "420\n",
      "forget the immortals now, for his was a virtuous mind.\n",
      "He cut off and cast in the fire as firstlings hairs from the head\n",
      "of the white-tusked hog, with prayers to all the gods\n",
      "that quick-witted Odysseus might return to his own home.\n",
      "Then he lifted a billet of oak he’d kept from the splitting\n",
      "425\n",
      "and felled the hog. It died. They cut its throat and singed it,\n",
      "then butchered it at once. The swineherd took cuts of raw flesh\n",
      "from all its limbs as firstlings, wrapped them in rich fat,\n",
      "gave them a sprinkling of barley, then threw them in the fire.\n",
      "The rest they cut up, and threaded the pieces on spits,\n",
      "430\n",
      "and roasted them carefully, then drew all the pieces off\n",
      "and heaped them on platters. The swineherd now\n",
      "stood up to carve, an expert in fair sharing. The meat\n",
      "he sliced into seven portions: one he set aside\n",
      "for the nymphs and for Hermēs, son of Maia, together\n",
      "435\n",
      "with an accompanying prayer. Of the rest, each man got one.\n",
      "But Odysseus he honored with the long cuts from the chine\n",
      "of the white-tusked hog, and gladdened his master’s heart.\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus now addressed him, saying: “Eumaios,4\n",
      "I only wish you could be as dear to Zeus the Father\n",
      "440\n",
      "as to me, a poor man, whom you honor with such good things.”\n",
      "To him, then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n",
      "“Eat, my strange guest, and enjoy what’s offered here,\n",
      "such as it is. A god will give one thing, but let another go,\n",
      "just as the whim takes him. He can do anything .”\n",
      "445\n",
      "So he spoke, and offered the firstlings to the gods that are forever,\n",
      "poured bright wine in libation, then put the cup in the hands\n",
      "of Odysseus, sacker of cities, and sat down by his portion.\n",
      "Bread was served to them by Mesaulios, whom the swineherd\n",
      "had acquired by himself, during his master’s absence,\n",
      "450\n",
      "unknown to his mistress and to the aged Laërtēs,\n",
      "purchasing him from the Taphians with his own resources.\n",
      "So they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\n",
      "But when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "Mesaulios took off the bread, and they hastened to retire,\n",
      "455\n",
      "filled to repletion with all the bread and meat they’d eaten.\n",
      "Now night came on—bad weather, the dark of the moon. Zeus rained\n",
      "the whole night through. A strong wet west wind kept blowing.\n",
      "Then Odysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd:\n",
      "would he strip off his own cloak and give it him, or tell\n",
      "460\n",
      "one of his comrades to do so, since he cared for him so much?\n",
      "‘‘Hear me out now, Eumaios, and you, all his other comrades,\n",
      "while I tell you a boastful story. It’s the wine that’s urging me—\n",
      "mind-crazing stuff, that sets on even the quick-witted\n",
      "to singing and gentle laughter, drives him to get up and dance,\n",
      "465\n",
      "or to make some remark better left unspoken. However,\n",
      "now that I’ve opened up, I won’t keep quiet about it.\n",
      "I wish I was young again and my strength still undiminished,\n",
      "like the time we prepared an ambush, and led it beneath Troy’s walls.\n",
      "The leaders were Odysseus and Atreus’ son Menelaös,\n",
      "470\n",
      "and I was the third in command, at their own invitation.\n",
      "When we came up under the city and its sheer wall,\n",
      "around the outskirts, in the thick brushwood, among\n",
      "the reeds and marshes, crouching down under our arms\n",
      "we lay. A bad night came on when the north wind dropped.\n",
      "475\n",
      "It grew chilly. Snow descended on us like hoar frost,\n",
      "freezing cold. Ice crystals formed upon our shields.\n",
      "Now all the rest were equipped with cloaks and tunics\n",
      "and slept in peace, their shields pulled over their shoulders,\n",
      "but when I set out I’d left my cloak behind with my comrades—\n",
      "480\n",
      "thoughtlessly, not supposing I’d ever get so cold,\n",
      "so I’d come with only my shield and my shining waist-guard.\n",
      "But in the third watch of the night, when the stars had turned,\n",
      "then I spoke to Odysseus, who was lying close beside me,\n",
      "nudging him with my elbow. He gave ear at once.\n",
      "485\n",
      "‘Scion of Zeus, Laërtēs’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "I shan’t be among the living much longer, this wintry cold\n",
      "is killing me, I’ve no cloak, some god beguiled me\n",
      "into wearing a tunic only: there’s no way out for me now.’\n",
      "“So I spoke, and he then thought up the following scheme—\n",
      "490\n",
      "such a man he was both for planning and for fighting!—\n",
      "and speaking in a low voice he addressed me, saying:\n",
      "‘Quiet now, in case some other Achaian might overhear you.’\n",
      "With that, head propped on his bent arm,5 he made a speech:\n",
      "‘Listen, friends: a god-sent dream came to me while I slept.\n",
      "495\n",
      "We’ve come too far from the ships. Is there someone who’d go\n",
      "and ask Atreus’ son Agamemnōn, his people’s shepherd,\n",
      "could he send us more of the troops from beside the ships?’\n",
      "“So he spoke, and there stood up Thoas, Andraimōn’s son,\n",
      "with alacrity, laid aside his purple cloak, and set off,\n",
      "500\n",
      "running, back to the ships. I lay down in his clothing\n",
      "gladly. Then Dawn, golden-throned, appeared. Would that\n",
      "I were young now, as then I was, my strength still unimpaired—\n",
      "then would one of the hands in the farmstead lend me a cloak,\n",
      "both from kindness and out of respect for a decent man.\n",
      "505\n",
      "But as it is they despise me for the rags I’m wearing.”\n",
      "To him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n",
      "“Old man, this tale you recounted was faultless: in it\n",
      "nothing you said was unfitting or profitless. Hence\n",
      "you’ll not go short of clothing nor of anything else\n",
      "510\n",
      "that befits a long-suffering suppliant on arrival—\n",
      "for now: but at first light you’ll go back to your rags,\n",
      "since here there aren’t many cloaks or changes of tunic\n",
      "to put on: no more than one for each man. But when\n",
      "Odysseus’ dear son returns, you can look to him\n",
      "515\n",
      "for clothing to wear, a cloak and a tunic too,\n",
      "and he’ll send you wherever your heart and mind desire.”\n",
      "So saying, up he got, and made up close to the fire\n",
      "a bed, throwing on it the skins of sheep and goats,\n",
      "and Odysseus lay down there, and over him he spread\n",
      "520\n",
      "a big thick cloak he kept by him to change into\n",
      "whenever a really bad winter storm arose.\n",
      "So there Odysseus slept, and alongside him slept too\n",
      "the four young men. But the swineherd himself was not\n",
      "content to bed down there, to sleep away from the hogs,\n",
      "525\n",
      "and made ready to go outside. Odysseus was glad\n",
      "that he took such care of his absent lord’s property.\n",
      "First he slung a sharp sword from his sturdy shoulders,\n",
      "then donned a very thick cloak to keep the wind out,\n",
      "and over this draped the fleece of a well-fed goat,\n",
      "530\n",
      "and took a sharp hunting-spear as defense against dogs or men,\n",
      "and went out to get some rest where the white-tusked hogs\n",
      "slept, under a hollow rock, out of reach of the north wind.\n",
      "Book 15\n",
      "Now Pallas Athēnē was gone to spacious Lakedaimōn,\n",
      "to remind Odysseus’ great-hearted, illustrious son\n",
      "about his return journey, to speed up his homecoming.\n",
      "She found Tēlemachos and Nestōr’s splendid son\n",
      "bedded down in the forecourt of glorious Menelaös.\n",
      "5\n",
      "Now Nestōr’s son was still overmastered by gentle sleep,\n",
      "but sweet sleep had not taken Tēlemachos: worry about his father\n",
      "had kept him wakeful throughout the ambrosial night.\n",
      "Now grey-eyed Athēnē approached and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“It’s not a good thing, Tēlemachos, this straying far from home,\n",
      "10\n",
      "neglecting your possessions, the overweening men\n",
      "infesting your house, the risk they may share and consume\n",
      "all your goods, while you’re gone on this useless journey!\n",
      "You must urge Menelaös, good at the war cry, at once\n",
      "to send you back, if you want to find your blameless mother\n",
      "15\n",
      "at home still: already her father and brothers are at her\n",
      "to marry Eurymachos—as a gift giver he outdoes\n",
      "all the other suitors, is ratcheting up the bride-price!\n",
      "And make sure she takes no item from the house without your consent—\n",
      "for you know the kind of thinking that lurks in a woman’s breast:\n",
      "20\n",
      "she wants to increase the estate of the man who marries her,\n",
      "but of former children and previous wedded spouse\n",
      "she takes no thought once he’s dead, no longer asks after him.\n",
      "No, you must go yourself, and entrust all your property\n",
      "to whichever one of your maidservants seems most reliable\n",
      "25\n",
      "until the gods name to you your own noble bride-to-be.\n",
      "And another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\n",
      "The best of the suitors are lying in wait for you, with intent,\n",
      "in the strait between Ithákē and rugged Samē, determined\n",
      "to kill you before you get back to your native land.\n",
      "30\n",
      "But I don’t see it happening. Before that, the earth will cover\n",
      "some one of the suitors now devouring your livelihood.\n",
      "Still, keep your well-built ship far distant from the islands,\n",
      "and sail by night: you’ll get a good tailwind from that\n",
      "one immortal it is who guards and protects you. But when\n",
      "35\n",
      "you make landfall at the nearest shore of Ithákē then,\n",
      "send on the ship with all your comrades to the city;\n",
      "you yourself, though, must first seek out the swineherd—\n",
      "he looks after your pigs, and also is well disposed\n",
      "toward you. Spend the night there, and tell him to go into town\n",
      "40\n",
      "with a message for prudent Penelopē: that you’re unharmed,\n",
      "and that you’ve made it back home successfully from Pylos.”\n",
      "This said, she went on her way to lofty Olympos.\n",
      "Tēlemachos then awoke Nestōr’s son from his sweet sleep\n",
      "with a kick of the foot,1 saying: “Rise and shine now,\n",
      "45\n",
      "Peisistratos, Nestōr’s son! Bring out your whole-hooved horses,\n",
      "harness them up to the chariot! We need to get going.”\n",
      "Peisistratos, son of Nestōr, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, however much we want to be on the road\n",
      "no way can we drive through the dark night! It’ll soon be dawn.\n",
      "50\n",
      "So wait until Menelaös—Atreus’ hero son, famed spearman—\n",
      "brings out his gifts and stows them aboard the chariot,\n",
      "and sends us on our way with affectionate good wishes;\n",
      "for a guest remembers with gratitude all his days\n",
      "the man who was his host, who showed him kindness.”\n",
      "55\n",
      "So he spoke, and promptly golden-throned Dawn arrived.\n",
      "Menelaös, good at the war cry, came out to them then,\n",
      "getting up from the bed that he shared with fair-tressed Helen,\n",
      "and when Odysseus’ son, the hero, caught sight of him, he\n",
      "hurriedly clothed himself in his shining tunic, and flung\n",
      "60\n",
      "a great cloak over his sturdy shoulders, and went out\n",
      "and approached Menelaös and stood before him and said:\n",
      "[did Tēlemachos, the dear son of godlike Odysseus, saying:]2\n",
      "“Atreus’ son Menelaös, Zeus’ scion, leader of hosts,\n",
      "send me back right away to my own dear country,\n",
      "65\n",
      "for already my heart is impatient for the homeward journey.”\n",
      "Menelaös, good at the war cry, then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, I’ll not press you to stay here overlong\n",
      "when you want to go home: indeed, I’d blame any other man\n",
      "who, as host, behaved in an overfriendly manner\n",
      "70\n",
      "as I would the downright unfriendly! Moderation in all things\n",
      "is best. It’s just as wrong to urge a guest’s departure\n",
      "against his will as to keep him when he’s itching to be off.\n",
      "Treat your guest well while he’s there, let him go when he wants.\n",
      "Just wait, though, until I bring your presents, and stow them—\n",
      "75\n",
      "fine ones—aboard your chariot, for you to see, while I tell\n",
      "the women to get dinner ready from the rich store within.\n",
      "For there’s prestige and glory as well as profit when those\n",
      "off to travel this boundless earth eat a square meal first.\n",
      "And if you’d like a detour through Hellas and mid-Argos,\n",
      "80\n",
      "I’d be happy to come along with you, I’ll harness up horses\n",
      "and be your guide round the cities—no one will pass us on\n",
      "empty-handed, they’ll give us something to take with us,\n",
      "a fine bronze tripod, perhaps, or maybe a cauldron,\n",
      "or a team of two mules, or a golden drinking cup.”\n",
      "85\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Atreus’ son Menelaös, Zeus’ scion, leader of hosts,\n",
      "I want to go back to our place now: when I came here I left\n",
      "no one to act as guardian over my possessions.\n",
      "In seeking my godlike father I fear I may perish myself,\n",
      "90\n",
      "or some article of great value go missing from my halls.”\n",
      "When he heard this, at once Menelaös, good at the war cry,\n",
      "gave instructions both to his wife and to her handmaids\n",
      "to make ready a meal in the hall from the rich store within.\n",
      "Eteōneus son of Boēthoös,3 now approached him,\n",
      "95\n",
      "having just got up—he lived very close nearby—\n",
      "and him Menelaös, good at the war cry, asked\n",
      "to light a fire, and to roast some meat: he heard and did not\n",
      "disobey. Menelaös now went to his fragrant storeroom,\n",
      "not alone, but together with Helen and Megapenthēs.4\n",
      "100\n",
      "When they came to where their valuables were stored\n",
      "the son of Atreus chose a two-handled cup, and told\n",
      "his son Megapenthēs to carry a mixing bowl, made of silver,\n",
      "while Helen went and stood by the clothing-chests, where lay\n",
      "the embroidered robes that she herself had fashioned.\n",
      "105\n",
      "One of these Helen, bright among women, chose\n",
      "and lifted out—the largest, the most exquisitely embroidered,\n",
      "that shone like a star and lay underneath all the rest.\n",
      "They went on out from the house till they met Tēlemachos,\n",
      "And fair-haired Menelaös then addressed him, saying:\n",
      "110\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, may the return that your heart so much desires\n",
      "be brought to pass by Zeus, Hērē’s loud-thundering spouse!\n",
      "And of all the gifts that are stored away in my house\n",
      "I’ll give you the one that’s most beautiful and most precious—\n",
      "a finely wrought mixing bowl, one fashioned all of silver\n",
      "115\n",
      "except for its rim, that’s finished off in gold,\n",
      "the work of Hephaistos, a gift from the hero Phaidimos,\n",
      "the Sidonians’ king, at the time that his house gave me shelter\n",
      "on my way home by that route. Now I’d like to give it to you.”\n",
      "So saying, Atreus’ son, the hero, placed in his hands\n",
      "120\n",
      "the two-handled cup, and strong Megapenthēs brought\n",
      "the shining mixing bowl, all silver, set it before him;\n",
      "while fair-cheeked Helen came up to him, carrying\n",
      "the robe in her hands, and now addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“I too, dear child, now give you this gift, a memento\n",
      "125\n",
      "from Helen’s hands, for your bride to wear at your longed-for\n",
      "wedding. Till then, keep it stored in your halls, looked after\n",
      "by your dear mother. And may you enjoy a safe return\n",
      "to your well-built home and to your own dear country.”\n",
      "That said, she put it into his hands. He received it with pleasure.\n",
      "130\n",
      "The hero Peisistratos now took all the gifts and stowed them\n",
      "in the luggage box, gazing at them in wondering admiration.\n",
      "Fair-headed Menelaös now led them into the house\n",
      "and had them all sit down upon chairs and benches,\n",
      "and a servant brought hand-washing water in a beautiful\n",
      "135\n",
      "golden ewer and poured it over a silver basin so\n",
      "they could wash, and drew up a polished table for them.\n",
      "The respected housekeeper brought in bread and served it\n",
      "along with many side dishes, giving freely of what there was,\n",
      "while, nearby, Boēthoös’ son carved helpings of meat,\n",
      "140\n",
      "and the son of renowned Menelaös poured out the wine.\n",
      "So they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\n",
      "But when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "Then Tēlemachos and the splendid son of Nestōr\n",
      "harnessed the horses and boarded the fine-wrought chariot\n",
      "145\n",
      "and drove out from the forecourt and the echoing colonnade.\n",
      "With them went Atreus’ son, the fair-haired Menelaös,\n",
      "his right hand holding enough mind-honeying wine\n",
      "in a golden cup, so they might, on leaving, pour libations.\n",
      "Now he stood in front of the chariot, and pledged them, saying:\n",
      "150\n",
      "“Farewell, young men—and to Nestor, shepherd of the people,\n",
      "take my greetings: to me he was like a kindly father\n",
      "when we sons of Achaians were warring in the country of Troy.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“All this indeed, Zeus’ nursling, exactly as you say,\n",
      "155\n",
      "we’ll recount to him on arrival. I only wish that as surely,\n",
      "when I return to Ithákē, I’d find Odysseus at home,\n",
      "and be able to tell him all the kindness I’d had from you\n",
      "before coming, all the fine presents that I was bringing home.”\n",
      "Just as he finished speaking, a bird flew in on the right,\n",
      "160\n",
      "an eagle, grasping a great white goose in its talons,\n",
      "a tame bird out of the yard, and a crowd of men and women\n",
      "ran behind, shouting. The eagle swooped toward them\n",
      "from the right, in front of the horses. They rejoiced at the sight,\n",
      "and the spirits of all were comforted in their hearts.\n",
      "165\n",
      "Peisistratos, Nestōr’s son, was the first to speak. He said:\n",
      "“Consider now, Zeus’ nursling, Menelaös, leader of hosts—\n",
      "Was it for us that the god showed this sign, or for you yourself?”\n",
      "So he spoke. Menelaös the warlike was figuring in his mind\n",
      "the right way to think, what might be his best response,\n",
      "170\n",
      "when long-robed Helen got in ahead of him, saying:\n",
      "“Listen to me! I shall prophesy now, as the immortals\n",
      "put it into my heart, how I think it will come to pass.\n",
      "As this eagle seized the goose brought up in our household,\n",
      "swooping down from the mountain where he was born and bred,\n",
      "175\n",
      "so Odysseus—many ills borne, having wandered far—\n",
      "will come back home and take vengeance, or maybe is home\n",
      "already, and sowing the seeds of trouble for the suitors.”\n",
      "Then sagacious Tēlemachos responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“So now may Zeus enact it, Hērē’s loud-thundering husband!\n",
      "180\n",
      "Then there too I’d pray to you as I would to a god.”\n",
      "That said,\n",
      "he gave the horses a touch of the whip: they at once\n",
      "galloped eagerly out of the city toward the plain,\n",
      "and strained all day at the yoke set about their necks,\n",
      "till the sun went down and all the ways were in shadow,\n",
      "185\n",
      "and they came to Phērai, to the dwelling of Dioklēs\n",
      "the son of Ortilochos, whom Alpheios begot, and there\n",
      "they spent the night, and he entertained them as guests.\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "they harnessed the horses and boarded the inlaid chariot,\n",
      "190\n",
      "and drove out from the forecourt and echoing colonnade.\n",
      "At a touch of the whip the pair, nothing loath, sped forward,\n",
      "and soon made their way back to Pylos’ steep citadel.\n",
      "Then Tēlemachos spoke to the son of Nestōr, saying:\n",
      "“Son of Nestōr, will you promise to do the thing I’ll ask you,\n",
      "195\n",
      "and then in fact do it? We’re friends of long standing ourselves\n",
      "because of our fathers’ friendship. Besides, we’re the same age,\n",
      "so this journey will simply establish our like-mindedness!\n",
      "Don’t take me on past my ship, Zeus’ nursling, but leave me there:\n",
      "I’m afraid the old man will detain me in his house against my will,\n",
      "200\n",
      "through an urge to befriend me. I need to get home quickly.”\n",
      "So he spoke; and the son of Nestōr debated in his heart\n",
      "how he might properly give this promise and fulfill it;\n",
      "and as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\n",
      "he turned his horses toward the swift ship and the seashore,\n",
      "205\n",
      "and there unpacked the fine gifts, laid them out in the ship’s stern—\n",
      "the clothes and gold Menelaös had given Tēlemachos,\n",
      "whom he now encouraged, addressed with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Embark now, quickly, and summon all your comrades\n",
      "before I get home and break the news to the old man!\n",
      "210\n",
      "For this I know well, in my mind and heart: his spirit\n",
      "is so overbearing, he just won’t let you go—\n",
      "he’ll come out here in person to escort you back: I don’t think\n",
      "he’d mean to go home empty-handed! As it is, he’ll be very cross.”\n",
      "That said, he drove off his beautiful-maned horses\n",
      "215\n",
      "back to the Pylians’ township, and quickly reached his home.\n",
      "Tēlemachos meanwhile urged on his comrades, saying:\n",
      "“Put all the gear on the black ship in order, my comrades,\n",
      "and let’s embark ourselves, and then be on our way.”\n",
      "So he spoke; they heard and promptly obeyed him,\n",
      "220\n",
      "and embarked at once, and seated themselves at their rowlocks.\n",
      "Now while he was busy with prayer and sacrifice to Athēnē\n",
      "by the stern of the ship, he was approached by a person\n",
      "from a distant land, Argos—a fugitive murderer,\n",
      "a seer, a man related by descent to Melampous,\n",
      "225\n",
      "who long ago was a dweller in Pylos, mother of flocks—\n",
      "a wealthy Pylian, occupant of a very large house, but now\n",
      "a stranger in other men’s country, fleeing from his own land\n",
      "and from great-hearted Nēleus, noblest of living men,\n",
      "who for a full year had kept his great wealth from him\n",
      "230\n",
      "by main force, for Melampous lay shackled in Phylakos’ halls,\n",
      "under harsh constraint, and suffering grievous hardship\n",
      "because of Nēleus’ daughter, and the heavy infatuation\n",
      "which the Fury—that ruinous goddess—put in his mind.\n",
      "And yet\n",
      "he escaped his fate, and drove off the loud-lowing cattle\n",
      "235\n",
      "to Pylos from Phylakē, paid out the godlike Nēleus\n",
      "for his misdeed, and brought the girl home as a wife\n",
      "for his own brother. He himself went to other men’s land,\n",
      "to horse-pasturing Argos, where it was destined that he\n",
      "should dwell, and hold sway over numerous Argives. There\n",
      "240\n",
      "he married a wife and established a high-roofed house,\n",
      "and sired Antiphatēs and Mantios, two sturdy sons.\n",
      "Antiphatēs later begot great-hearted Oiklēs, and\n",
      "Oiklēs sired Amphiaraös, rouser of hosts, whom Zeus\n",
      "of the aegis and Apollo both held in great affection\n",
      "245\n",
      "and befriended in every way. Yet he never reached old age’s\n",
      "threshold, but died in Thēbai because of a woman’s gifts.5\n",
      "To him were born two sons, Amphilochos and Alkmaiōn,\n",
      "while Mantios begot Polypheidēs and Kleitos. The latter\n",
      "Dawn, golden-throned, snatched away because of his beauty,\n",
      "250\n",
      "so that he might be numbered among the immortals;\n",
      "but high-spirited Polypheidēs Apollo made a seer,\n",
      "by far the best of mortals, after Amphiaraös died.\n",
      "He moved to Hyperēsēa when he fell out with his father,\n",
      "and there he made his home, and prophesied to all mortals.\n",
      "255\n",
      "His son it was, Theoklymenos by name, who now\n",
      "came up and stood by Tēlemachos. He found him pouring\n",
      "libations and praying, there by his black ship,\n",
      "and he spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Friend, since I find you at sacrifice in this place,\n",
      "260\n",
      "I entreat you by these burnt offerings, by the god, and by\n",
      "your own head, and by the comrades who travel with you,\n",
      "answer what I ask truly, and hold back nothing:\n",
      "Who are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "265\n",
      "“So, stranger, let me answer your questions quite honestly:\n",
      "I’m from Ithákē by birth, and my father is Odysseus—\n",
      "if ever he was—who by now must have met his grim destiny—\n",
      "which is why I’ve set out with my comrades in a black ship\n",
      "and have come seeking news of my long-absent father.”\n",
      "270\n",
      "Theoklymenos the godlike responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“I likewise have left my country, after killing a man\n",
      "of my own clan: many brothers and kinsmen he has\n",
      "in horse-pasturing Argos, with great power over Achaians.\n",
      "It’s to avoid meeting death and black fate at their hands\n",
      "275\n",
      "that I’m on the run. It’s my fate to wander among men.\n",
      "Take me aboard your ship, as your suppliant fugitive,\n",
      "lest they murder me, for I think they’re hot on my trail.”\n",
      "Then sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“I shall not, since you want it, debar you from my trim ship.\n",
      "280\n",
      "Come aboard! We’ll look after you, with what little we have.”\n",
      "So saying, he took the other’s bronze spear from him,\n",
      "and laid it at length on the deck of the shapely vessel,\n",
      "then he himself embarked on the seagoing ship,\n",
      "and seated himself in the stern, and made a place beside him\n",
      "285\n",
      "for Theoklymenos too. His men cast off the stern warps,\n",
      "and Tēlemachos now issued orders to his comrades\n",
      "to belay the tackle, and they promptly obeyed him.\n",
      "The fir-wood mast they raised up and stepped in the hollow\n",
      "mast block, held it in place with the forestays, and then\n",
      "290\n",
      "hauled up the white sail with the halyards of plaited leather.\n",
      "Grey-eyed Athēnē now sent them a blustery tailwind,\n",
      "gusting through the bright air, so the ship might swiftly\n",
      "complete her journey, speeding over the briny deep.\n",
      "[They voyaged past The Springs, and sweet-streamed Chalkis],6\n",
      "295\n",
      "till the sun went down and all the ways were in shadow,\n",
      "and the ship reached Pheai, driven on by the wind of Zeus,\n",
      "then skirted bright Ēlis, where the Epeians hold sway.\n",
      "Onward from there Tēlemachos made for the Sharp7 Islands,\n",
      "uncertain in mind if he was going to dodge death or be captured.\n",
      "300\n",
      "Back in the hut, Odysseus and the noble swineherd\n",
      "were at supper: the other men were eating the meal with them.\n",
      "When they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "Odysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd,\n",
      "to see if he’d still befriend him, invite him to stay there\n",
      "305\n",
      "in the farmstead, or urge him to try his luck in the city.\n",
      "“Hear me out now, Eumaios, and all you other comrades!\n",
      "In the morning I’m minded to make my way to the city,\n",
      "to beg for food, and not be a burden on you and your fellows.\n",
      "So advise me well, and give me a reliable guide\n",
      "310\n",
      "to take me there. But I’ll need to wander through the city\n",
      "on my own, perhaps be given some bread, a cup of water.\n",
      "I might even go to the house of noble Odysseus,\n",
      "and impart what news I have to prudent Penelopē, mingle\n",
      "in the company of the suitors, overbearing though they are,\n",
      "315\n",
      "to see if they’d spare me dinner from their limitless plenty.\n",
      "I could offer them, there and then, services they might need—\n",
      "let me list them, and you pay attention and hear me out!—\n",
      "Through the favor of Hermēs the Guide, the god who endows\n",
      "the endeavors of every man with elegance and renown,\n",
      "320\n",
      "in the matter of service, no other mortal could match me:\n",
      "building a fire well, or chopping up dry firewood,\n",
      "or carving and roasting meat, or pouring out the wine—\n",
      "all such things in which the common folk serve their betters.”\n",
      "Deeply disturbed you then answered him, swineherd Eumaios:\n",
      "325\n",
      "“Oh my, stranger, what can have put such a notion\n",
      "into your mind? You must be set on your own destruction\n",
      "if you mean to go in among this company of suitors,\n",
      "whose violence and arrogance go up to the iron sky!\n",
      "Not such as you are the servants of these people:\n",
      "330\n",
      "no indeed: it’s young men, well dressed in mantles and tunics,\n",
      "their heads always slick with oil, their faces handsome,\n",
      "who wait on them: their tables are kept well polished,\n",
      "and are heavily laden with bread and meat and wine.\n",
      "No, you stay here, where no one’s irked by your presence—\n",
      "335\n",
      "neither I, nor any of the other men I have here.\n",
      "But when the dear son of Odysseus comes back home,\n",
      "he’ll fit you out with a cloak and tunic, and send you\n",
      "wherever your heart and spirit say you should go.”\n",
      "Much-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "340\n",
      "“Eumaios, I wish you could be as dear to Zeus the Father\n",
      "as to me, whom you’ve saved from wandering and distress!\n",
      "There’s no worse evil for mortals than vagrancy; and yet\n",
      "for the sake of their cursed bellies men incur grim hardship\n",
      "[when wandering, grief, and pain assail any one of them].\n",
      "345\n",
      "But now, since you’re keeping me here, and want me to wait\n",
      "for him, your master, now tell me of godlike Odysseus’ mother\n",
      "and father, whom he left here on the edge of old age—\n",
      "are they perhaps still living beneath the rays of the sun,\n",
      "or are they dead by now and in the realm of Hādēs?”\n",
      "350\n",
      "Then the swineherd, leader of men, responded to him:\n",
      "“So, stranger, I’ll give your question a truthful answer.\n",
      "Laërtēs still lives, but constantly prays to Zeus\n",
      "that the spirit may fade from his limbs within his halls,\n",
      "because of his terrible grief for the son who’s absent,\n",
      "355\n",
      "and for his wise wedded wife, who by dying caused him\n",
      "most sorrow, and brought him to old age before his time.\n",
      "She died of grief, lamenting her glorious son—\n",
      "a miserable death, that I’d wish no man to suffer\n",
      "that lived here as my close friend and treated me kindly.\n",
      "360\n",
      "So long as she lived, though it was in a state of sorrow,\n",
      "It gave me pleasure to ask and enquire after her, since she\n",
      "had raised me herself, together with long-robed Ktiménē,\n",
      "her clever daughter, whom she bore as her youngest child.\n",
      "With her I was reared, and she favored me scarcely less.\n",
      "365\n",
      "But when we both reached the longed-for prime of youth,\n",
      "her they saw married on Samē, and she had countless bride-gifts;\n",
      "but me she clothed in a mantle and tunic, both\n",
      "of the finest stuff, shod me with sandals, and then sent me\n",
      "out on the estate. Yet at heart it was me she cared for more.\n",
      "370\n",
      "These days I go short of such things, yet the blessed gods\n",
      "prosper the work of my hands, at which I labor:\n",
      "that lets me eat and drink, care for respected guests.\n",
      "Yet from my mistress I hear nothing pleasant, either\n",
      "by word or deed, for an evil has fallen on the household—\n",
      "375\n",
      "these arrogant men! The servants greatly need and want\n",
      "to speak personally with their mistress, check each detail,\n",
      "eat and drink, and then take some tid-bit back with them\n",
      "to the fields—such are the things as warm a servant’s heart.”\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "380\n",
      "“Indeed, swineherd Eumaios, how little you must have been\n",
      "when parted so far from your country and your parents!\n",
      "But come now, tell me this, and give me the true answer:\n",
      "Was the wide-wayed city of men destroyed in which\n",
      "your father and lady mother had their dwelling?\n",
      "385\n",
      "Or when you were out alone with your sheep or cattle,\n",
      "did hostile men carry you off in their ships for sale here\n",
      "to your master’s house, and he paid a good price for you?”\n",
      "Then the swineherd, leader of men, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, since you’re questioning me about these matters,\n",
      "390\n",
      "listen in silence now at your ease, and drink your wine\n",
      "while you sit here. These nights are endless: you can sleep,\n",
      "you can also listen for pleasure. No need to bed down\n",
      "before the time comes. Too much sleep can be exhausting.\n",
      "If any one of the rest of you feels the urge to do so,\n",
      "395\n",
      "let him go out and sleep in the open: then, when it’s dawn,\n",
      "get a bite to eat, and take care of our master’s swine.\n",
      "But we two will drink and feast in the hut, and enjoy\n",
      "hearing about each other’s wretched misfortunes\n",
      "as we recall them. A man looking back can find pleasure\n",
      "400\n",
      "even in grief, one who’s suffered and wandered much.\n",
      "“So now let me answer the questions that you asked me.\n",
      "There’s an island called Syria—you may have heard tell of it—\n",
      "at the turning points of the sun, out beyond Ortygiē,8\n",
      "It’s not very populous, but possesses excellent terrain:\n",
      "405\n",
      "good for cattle and sheep, many vineyards, abundant wheat.\n",
      "No famine ever afflicts this land, nor does any other\n",
      "hateful disease appear as a plague to wretched mortals,\n",
      "but when the tribes of mankind grow old in the city,\n",
      "then comes silver-bowed Apollo, together with Artemis,\n",
      "410\n",
      "and assails and slays them with his gentle arrows.\n",
      "Two cities there are: all the land’s divided between them,\n",
      "and over them both my father held sway as king—\n",
      "Ktēsios, Ormenos’ son, who was likened to the immortals.\n",
      "“Thither Phoenicians came, men famous for their ships,\n",
      "415\n",
      "sharp traffickers, countless trinkets in their black vessel.\n",
      "Now there was in my father’s household a Phoenician woman,\n",
      "tall and good-looking, highly skilled in fine handiwork,\n",
      "and her these crafty Phoenicians set about to beguile.\n",
      "First, while she was washing clothes near the hollow ship,\n",
      "420\n",
      "one of them made love to her, a thing that fuddles the senses\n",
      "of truly feminine women, even one that’s well-behaved.\n",
      "Then he asked her who she was and from where, and she at once\n",
      "pointed out my father’s high-roofed house, and declared:\n",
      "‘I come from Sidon, that bronze-rich city, and am\n",
      "425\n",
      "the daughter of Arybas, a man who had rivers of wealth;\n",
      "but a bunch of Taphian pirates kidnapped me on my way\n",
      "back from the fields, and brought me here. I was sold\n",
      "to the man who lives up there, and he paid a good price for me.’\n",
      "“Then the man who’d secretly had her responded to her, saying:\n",
      "430\n",
      "‘Would you like to go back with us now and get to see\n",
      "the high-roofed house of your father and mother?—them too,\n",
      "for they’re still alive, and the word is they’re very rich?’\n",
      "“Then the woman responded to him in these words, saying:\n",
      "‘This indeed might be done, if all you sailors were willing\n",
      "435\n",
      "to swear an oath that you’d deliver me home unharmed.’\n",
      "“So she spoke, and they all swore the oath as she demanded.\n",
      "But when they’d sworn, and completed the terms of the oath,\n",
      "the woman addressed them again, in these words, saying:\n",
      "‘Keep quiet now, and let none of your crew accost me\n",
      "440\n",
      "if we chance to encounter each other, either out on the street\n",
      "or at the well, in case someone goes to his dwelling\n",
      "and tells the old man, so that he becomes suspicious\n",
      "and keeps me closely confined, and plans your destruction.\n",
      "So don’t forget what I say, and be quick with the barter\n",
      "445\n",
      "for your homeward voyage! When your ship is fully laden,\n",
      "then contact me up at the house, and I will come,\n",
      "with any gold I can find; and there’s one other thing\n",
      "I’d be glad to give you in return for my passage—a son\n",
      "of my master, whose house-nurse I am, a clever child\n",
      "450\n",
      "who trots along at my side when I go out: I’d bring him\n",
      "aboard with me—he’d fetch you a gigantic price, wherever\n",
      "you chose to sell him abroad to some foreign buyer.’\n",
      "“So she spoke, and went off back to the splendid mansion.\n",
      "They stayed there in our country for an entire year,\n",
      "455\n",
      "and by trafficking piled up the goods in their hollow ship.\n",
      "But when the ship’s hold was full-laden for their return,\n",
      "they then sent a messenger to alert the woman.\n",
      "A sharp-witted man it was that came to my father’s dwelling,\n",
      "bringing a golden necklace interlaced with amber beads.\n",
      "460\n",
      "So while in the hall the maidservants and my lady mother\n",
      "were handling and looking at this and making their offer\n",
      "to buy it, the man nodded silently to the woman,\n",
      "and, having done this, departed, making for the hollow ship,\n",
      "and she took me by the hand, led me out of the house.\n",
      "465\n",
      "There in the forecourt she found the cups and tables\n",
      "of the men who’d been dining, associates of my father\n",
      "who’d left for a council session, with public discussion.\n",
      "She quickly hid three cups under the front fold of her dress\n",
      "and carried them off. In my innocence I went with her.\n",
      "470\n",
      "So the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow,\n",
      "and we hurriedly made our way to the famous harbor\n",
      "where these Phoenician men’s swift ship was moored.\n",
      "They now embarked, and sailed out over the watery ways,\n",
      "with us two on board as well: Zeus gave us a tailwind.\n",
      "475\n",
      "For six days we sailed, both night and day; but when\n",
      "Zeus, son of Kronos, brought on the seventh day,\n",
      "then Artemis, divine archer, struck the woman down,\n",
      "and she fell in the bilge like a sea tern, with a thud.\n",
      "Her corpse they threw overboard to end as food for seals\n",
      "480\n",
      "and fishes, and I was left there, grieving at heart.\n",
      "Now wind and wave in their passage carried us to Ithákē,\n",
      "where Laërtēs bought me with his resources. Thus it was\n",
      "that I first happened to set eyes on this country.”\n",
      "To him then Odysseus, Zeus’ scion, responded, saying:\n",
      "485\n",
      "“Indeed, Eumaios, you’ve stirred the spirit in my breast\n",
      "by telling me all the heartfelt sorrows you endured!\n",
      "Yet surely you had some good along with the suffering\n",
      "from Zeus? After all your troubles you ended in the household\n",
      "of a decent man, who takes good care to provide you\n",
      "490\n",
      "with food and drink, and you have a good life; whereas I\n",
      "got here as a vagrant, who’d strayed through many folks’ cities.”\n",
      "These were the things they talked about to each other.\n",
      "Now they lay down and slept—briefly, not long, for soon\n",
      "came fair-throned Dawn. And meanwhile Tēlemachos’ comrades\n",
      "495\n",
      "made landfall. They furled the sail, unstepped the mast,\n",
      "smartly, and rowed the ship on till they reached their anchorage,\n",
      "then belayed the stern warps, threw out the anchor stones,\n",
      "and themselves, disembarking on the strand of the seashore,\n",
      "prepared their meal, and mixed the bright red wine;\n",
      "500\n",
      "and when they’d satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "sagacious Tēlemachos spoke first among them, saying:\n",
      "“The rest of you now row the black ship on to the city.\n",
      "I’m going out to inspect the fields and the herdsmen,\n",
      "and I’ll come into town this evening when I’ve seen to the estate.\n",
      "505\n",
      "Early tomorrow I’ll give you, as wages for your journey,\n",
      "a square meal of meat, with some sweetly drinkable wine.”\n",
      "Then godlike Theoklymenos addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Where should I go, dear child? To which particular house\n",
      "of the men in authority over rugged Ithákē?\n",
      "510\n",
      "Or shall I go straight to your house—yours and your mother’s?”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“In different circumstances I’d tell you to go to our house,\n",
      "where there’s no lack of hospitality; but for yourself\n",
      "that’s not a good idea, since I’ll be away, and my mother\n",
      "515\n",
      "won’t see you: she seldom comes out in the house to face\n",
      "the suitors, but works at her loom apart from them, upstairs.\n",
      "But I’ll tell you another man to whom you can go instead—\n",
      "Eurymachos, glorious son of skillful Polybos,\n",
      "whom nowadays the Ithákans treat like a god, for he\n",
      "520\n",
      "is their best man by far, as well as the most determined\n",
      "to marry my mother, acquire Odysseus’ privileges!\n",
      "Yet Olympian Zeus alone, the sky-dweller, knows whether\n",
      "he’ll meet with his day of ill destiny before that wedding.”\n",
      "As he spoke, a bird flew by on the right: a falcon,\n",
      "525\n",
      "Apollo’s swift messenger, clutching a dove in its talons,\n",
      "and plucking its feathers, that were shed on the ground\n",
      "midway between the ship and Tēlemachos himself.\n",
      "Then Theoklymenos called him aside from his comrades,\n",
      "and clasping him by the hand, exclaimed: “Tēlemachos,\n",
      "530\n",
      "not without some god’s will did that bird fly on our right!\n",
      "I knew, when I saw it, that this had to be an omen!\n",
      "There is no other family that’s more kingly than yours\n",
      "in the whole realm of Ithákē: you’ll hold power forever.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "535\n",
      "“If only these words of yours, stranger, might be fulfilled!\n",
      "Then would you quickly know friendship and gifts in plenty\n",
      "from me, so that any who met you would call you blessed.”\n",
      "That said, he then addressed Peiraios, a faithful comrade:\n",
      "“Peiraios, son of Klytios, in all else you’re the most\n",
      "540\n",
      "reliable of the comrades who accompanied me to Pylos:\n",
      "so now, please, take this stranger, give him a proper welcome\n",
      "in your home, with all due honor, until I come back.”\n",
      "Peiraios, famous spearman, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, no matter how long you may stay out here,\n",
      "545\n",
      "I shall take care of this man: as a guest he’ll lack for nothing.”\n",
      "So saying, he boarded the ship, and ordered his companions\n",
      "to cast off the stern warps and to embark themselves.\n",
      "They at once went on board, and sat down at their rowlocks.\n",
      "But Tēlemachos shod himself in his well-made sandals,\n",
      "550\n",
      "and took his sturdy spear, tipped with sharp-pointed bronze,\n",
      "from the deck of the ship. They cast off the stern warps,\n",
      "pushed clear, and made for the city, just as Tēlemachos,\n",
      "dear son of godlike Odysseus, had ordered them to do.\n",
      "But him his feet bore on, briskly striding, till he reached\n",
      "555\n",
      "the farmstead where were pigs unnumbered, beside which\n",
      "slept the good swineherd, with kind thoughts for his masters.\n",
      "Book 16\n",
      "The two in the hut, Odysseus and the noble swineherd,\n",
      "had stirred up the fire, and were making breakfast at dawn,\n",
      "and had sent out the herdsmen with droves of pigs to pasture.\n",
      "Their usually noisy dogs now fawned round Tēlemachos,\n",
      "not barking as he approached them. Noble Odysseus noticed\n",
      "5\n",
      "both the dogs’ silent fawning and the sound of footsteps,\n",
      "and at once he addressed Eumaios with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Eumaios, there’s somebody coming here—one of your comrades,\n",
      "or some other acquaintance, because the dogs aren’t barking\n",
      "but making up to him—and I can hear his footsteps.”\n",
      "10\n",
      "He’d not yet finished speaking when his own dear son\n",
      "appeared in the doorway. Amazed, the swineherd sprang up,\n",
      "and the vessels fell from his hands with which he’d been busy\n",
      "mixing the bright red wine. He went to greet his master\n",
      "and kissed his head and his two bright shining eyes\n",
      "15\n",
      "and both his hands, tears falling thick and fast.\n",
      "As a loving father welcomes his own dear son’s return\n",
      "from some distant land, after a ten-year absence—\n",
      "his only son, late-born, for whose sake he’s suffered much—\n",
      "so now did the noble swineherd clasp godlike Tēlemachos\n",
      "20\n",
      "and kiss him all over, as though he’d escaped from death,\n",
      "and, still weeping, then address him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“You’re back, Tēlemachos, sweet light of my eyes! I thought\n",
      "I’d never see you again when you sailed off to Pylos!\n",
      "Come in now, dear child, and let me pleasure my heart\n",
      "25\n",
      "with the sight of you inside here, now you’ve arrived!\n",
      "For you don’t often make visits to the herdsmen on the estate,\n",
      "but stay in town: these days it would seem your fancy is\n",
      "to observe the baneful throng of these men, the suitors.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "30\n",
      "“So it shall be, old fellow. It’s on your account I’m here,\n",
      "to see you myself, and have you tell me whether\n",
      "my mother is still in the house, or by now some other man\n",
      "has got her in marriage, so that maybe Odysseus’ bed,\n",
      "for lack of occupants, is full of foul spiders’ webs.”\n",
      "35\n",
      "Then the swineherd, leader of men, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Indeed, she still holds on with an all too steadfast spirit\n",
      "here in your halls, and always the sorrowful nights\n",
      "and days too waste her away with ceaseless weeping.”\n",
      "After thus speaking he took the bronze spear from him,\n",
      "40\n",
      "and Tēlemachos entered, passing over the stone threshold.\n",
      "As he approached, Odysseus, his father, offered him his seat,\n",
      "But Tēlemachos, facing him, refused the offer, saying:\n",
      "“Sit down, stranger: we’ll find us another seat somewhere\n",
      "in our own farmstead—here’s the man’s who’ll set it for us.”\n",
      "45\n",
      "So he spoke. Odysseus sat down again. For Tēlemachos\n",
      "the swineherd spread green brushwood, put a fleece over it,\n",
      "and Odysseus’ dear son now seated himself, and the swineherd\n",
      "set before each of them platters of roast meat\n",
      "left over from what they’d eaten the day before,\n",
      "50\n",
      "and hastily put fresh cuts of bread in the baskets,\n",
      "and in his ivy-wood bowl mixed some honey-sweet wine,\n",
      "and then sat down himself, facing godlike Odysseus.\n",
      "So they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them;\n",
      "But when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "55\n",
      "Tēlemachos then addressed the noble swineherd, saying:\n",
      "“Dad, where did this stranger come from? How did sailors\n",
      "bring him here to Ithákē? Who did they say they were?\n",
      "For I don’t imagine he made his way here on foot.”\n",
      "To him then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n",
      "60\n",
      "“Very well, child: I’ll tell you the whole true story. He claims\n",
      "to be from broad Krētē by birth. He says he’s wandered\n",
      "all over, from one human settlement to another,\n",
      "a vagrant: that’s the fate some divinity spun for him.\n",
      "But now he’s run away from a vessel of the Thesprōtians\n",
      "65\n",
      "and come to my farmstead. I put him into your hands.\n",
      "Do what you like with him. He says he’s your suppliant.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Eumaios, what you just said embarrasses me! For how\n",
      "am I to give this stranger a good welcome in my house?\n",
      "70\n",
      "I’m only a youth still, I don’t trust the strength of my hands\n",
      "against any man who may pick a quarrel with me.\n",
      "As for my mother, the heart in her breast is divided,\n",
      "whether to stay there with me and run the household,\n",
      "respecting her husband’s bed and the voice of the people,\n",
      "75\n",
      "or to go off with whoever’s the best of the Achaians\n",
      "as a suitor there in her halls, who offers the richest gifts.\n",
      "And regarding this stranger, since he’s come to your home,\n",
      "I’ll clothe him in mantle and tunic, garments of quality,\n",
      "and give him a two-edged sword and sandals for his feet,\n",
      "80\n",
      "and send him wherever his heart and spirit dictate.\n",
      "Or, if you like, keep him here and care for him in the farmstead,\n",
      "and I’ll send him down clothes and all the food he needs\n",
      "to eat, so he won’t be the ruin of you and your comrades.\n",
      "But up there I won’t let him go, to sojourn among\n",
      "85\n",
      "the suitors, for they’re overweening and wanton, and may\n",
      "mock him: that would cause me the greatest embarrassment.\n",
      "It’s hard for one man to get anything done against many,\n",
      "however strong he may be: they have far the greater power.”\n",
      "Much-enduring noble Odysseus now addressed him, saying:\n",
      "90\n",
      "“Friend—surely it’s proper that I should reply—indeed\n",
      "you rend my heart as I listen to all you tell me\n",
      "of the reckless acts that these suitors are now committing\n",
      "in your halls, against the will of one such as yourself!\n",
      "Tell me, do you let yourself be oppressed? Or is it\n",
      "95\n",
      "that some god’s word has led your countrymen to hate you?\n",
      "Or is it your brothers you blame, whom a man relies on\n",
      "in a tight corner, even when a major feud arises?\n",
      "I wish I was really as young now as I am in spirit,\n",
      "or the son of peerless Odysseus, or the man himself—\n",
      "100\n",
      "might return from his wandering: there’s still room for hope:1\n",
      "then might some foreign mortal at once cut off my head\n",
      "if I didn’t prove myself a disaster to all those fellows\n",
      "when I came to the main hall of Laërtēs’ son Odysseus!\n",
      "Were they to overwhelm me, one man alone, by numbers,\n",
      "105\n",
      "I’d much rather go down fighting, killed in my own home,\n",
      "than have to go on witnessing these unseemly actions—\n",
      "strangers maltreated, women servants forcibly dragged\n",
      "and manhandled everywhere in this beautiful building,\n",
      "wine recklessly squandered, men devouring my food\n",
      "110\n",
      "without purpose or limit, no end to the business in sight.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“So, stranger, I’ll give you a full and truthful answer.\n",
      "The people in general do not hate or resent me,\n",
      "nor have I brothers to blame, whom a man relies on\n",
      "115\n",
      "in a tight corner, even when a major feud arises.\n",
      "The fact is, our line’s been kept single by the son of Kronos:\n",

      "besides those who rule as princes in rugged Ithákē—\n",
      "are all courting my mother, and wasting my property.\n",
      "125\n",
      "She neither rejects this hateful marriage nor is able\n",
      "to end the business; so they go on eating up my estate\n",
      "and waste it away—very soon they’ll tear me to pieces too!\n",
      "Yet indeed all these matters rest on the knees of the gods.\n",
      "But now, dad, you go quickly, tell strong-minded Penelopē\n",
      "130\n",
      "that I’m safely back here for her, all the way from Pylos.\n",
      "I’m going to stay on here, and you come straight back yourself\n",
      "when you’ve told her, and only her: not a single other Achaian\n",
      "should get wind of it. Many people are planning trouble for me.”\n",
      "To him, then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n",
      "135\n",
      "“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\n",
      "But come, tell me this, and give me an honest answer:\n",
      "Should I not, this same trip, also take the news to Laërtēs,\n",
      "poor man? For a while, despite his great grief over Odysseus,\n",
      "he’d still keep an eye on the fields, still eat and drink\n",
      "140\n",
      "with the servants at home whenever the mood so took him;\n",
      "but now, from the day when you went off by ship to Pylos,\n",
      "they say he no longer eats or drinks as before,\n",
      "or goes out to the estate, but sits wailing and weeping\n",
      "in lamentation, and the flesh is wasting from his bones.”\n",
      "145\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“That’s too sad, but for now we’ll leave him, despite our grief.\n",
      "For if mortals somehow could have all they wanted, then\n",
      "our first choice would be the day for my father’s return.\n",
      "When you’ve given your message, come back. Don’t wander off\n",
      "150\n",
      "over the fields after him, but instruct my mother\n",
      "to send off a servant, the housekeeper, as soon as may be,\n",
      "secretly: she could take a message to the old man.”\n",
      "With that he sent off the swineherd, who found his sandals,\n",
      "put them on, and left for the city. Nor did Athēnē fail\n",
      "155\n",
      "to see the swineherd Eumaios depart from the farmstead,\n",
      "and herself approached now, in the likeness of a woman,\n",
      "one tall and handsome, and skilled in fine handiwork.\n",
      "She stood outside the hut’s entrance, visible to Odysseus;\n",
      "but Tēlemachos neither saw her in front of him nor\n",
      "160\n",
      "was aware of her presence: gods are not clearly manifest to all.\n",
      "But the dogs, like Odysseus, saw her: they didn’t bark, but slunk—\n",
      "terrified, whining—to the far side of the farmstead.\n",
      "She nodded to noble Odysseus: he saw it, and went\n",
      "out from the hall, past the great wall of the courtyard,\n",
      "165\n",
      "and stood before her. Athēnē then addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Laërtēs’ son, Zeus’ scion, resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "the time has come: say the word to your son, don’t hide it,\n",
      "so that you both may plot death and doom for the suitors\n",
      "for when you go back to the far-famed city: I myself\n",
      "170\n",
      "shall not be slow to join you: I’m ready for this battle!”\n",
      "That said, Athēnē touched him with her golden wand.\n",
      "She dressed him first in a new well-laundered mantle\n",
      "and tunic, made his body more youthful and powerful.\n",
      "His complexion grew swarthy again, his cheeks filled out,\n",
      "175\n",
      "and the beard on his chin darkened once more. This done,\n",
      "she took herself off, and Odysseus now went back\n",
      "into the hut. His dear son was amazed at the sight,\n",
      "and averted his eyes in alarm, lest this might be a god,\n",
      "and spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "180\n",
      "“Stranger, you look quite different from what you did earlier:\n",
      "you have different clothes on, your color isn’t the same!\n",
      "You must be one of the gods who hold broad heaven!\n",
      "Be gracious, that we may bring you acceptable offerings\n",
      "and golden gifts, finely wrought. Only spare us, be merciful!”\n",
      "185\n",
      "To him then much-enduring noble Odysseus responded:\n",
      "“I am no kind of god! Why liken me to the immortals?\n",
      "No, I am your father, for whose sake you are grieving\n",
      "and suffering much from the violence of men.”\n",
      "So saying\n",
      "he kissed his son, and the tears ran down his cheeks\n",
      "190\n",
      "that hitherto he’d always firmly held back; but Tēlemachos—\n",
      "not yet convinced that this man was really his father—\n",
      "once more spoke out, and responded to him, saying\n",
      "“You can’t be Odysseus, my father! No, this is some deity\n",
      "that’s deceiving me, so that I’ll grieve more bitterly hereafter!\n",
      "195\n",
      "There’s no way a mortal man could contrive all this\n",
      "by his own unaided wit—it required a god to help him,\n",
      "who could easily as he wanted make him either young or old.\n",
      "For you, a moment ago, were an old man, meanly clad,\n",
      "whereas now you resemble the gods who possess broad heaven.”\n",
      "200\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, it’s not fitting, when your own father is here,\n",
      "in the house, to be so astonished, indeed suspicious!\n",
      "I tell you, no other Odysseus will ever come here—\n",
      "It is I, such as I am, who have suffered much, wandered far,\n",
      "205\n",
      "and now, in the twentieth year, have come back home!\n",
      "What you see here’s the work of Athēnē, leader of hosts,\n",
      "who transforms me however she wants, for she has the power—\n",
      "sometimes to resemble a beggar, then again in the likeness\n",
      "of a young man, his body decked out in expensive clothes!\n",
      "210\n",
      "Easy enough for the gods, who possess broad heaven,\n",
      "both to exalt a mortal man, and to debase him.”\n",
      "That said, he sat down. Tēlemachos, shedding tears,\n",
      "cried out, and flung his arms round his own good father,\n",
      "and a longing arose in them both for lamentation:\n",
      "215\n",
      "their sobs came thicker and louder than the cries of birds,\n",
      "vultures or sea eagles with hooked talons, whose chicks\n",
      "hunters stole from their nests before they were full-fledged—\n",
      "just as piteous were their sobs and the tears they shed.\n",
      "And now the sun’s light would have set on their lamentation\n",
      "220\n",
      "had not Tēlemachos asked a quick question of his father:\n",
      "“On what kind of ship, dear father, was it that sailors\n",
      "brought you here to Ithákē? And who did they claim to be?\n",
      "For I don’t imagine you made your way here on foot.”\n",
      "Much-enduring noble Odysseus answered him, saying:\n",
      "225\n",
      "“So then, my child, I’ll tell you the whole true story.\n",
      "The Phaiakians brought me here, men famous for their ships—\n",
      "other men too they convey, whoever approaches them—\n",
      "and ferrying me asleep in a swift ship over the deep\n",
      "they set me down on Ithákē, and gave me splendid gifts,\n",
      "230\n",
      "bronze and gold in plenty, and woven clothing,\n",
      "all of which by the gods’ grace is lying stored in caves.\n",
      "And now I’ve come here at Athēnē’s instigation\n",
      "so that we may make plans together for killing our enemies.\n",
      "So come, count up and tell me the full tally of the suitors,\n",
      "235\n",
      "that I may know how many, and who, these fellows are,\n",
      "and after thinking it over in my peerless mind, decide\n",
      "whether we two are sufficient to stand against them alone,\n",
      "without the aid of others, or will need to round up support.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "240\n",
      "“Father, I’ve always been told about your great renown,\n",
      "that you were both a tough combatant and a shrewd planner;\n",
      "But what you just said is too much, I’m astounded! No way\n",
      "could two men fight so many, and strong men too!\n",
      "not just a group of ten suitors, or even twice that,\n",
      "245\n",
      "but many, many more! Let me tally them for you:\n",
      "From Doulichion there are no fewer than fifty-two\n",
      "chosen youths, with six servants to wait on them;\n",
      "from Samē, the count lists two dozen individuals;\n",
      "from Zákynthos, there are two score youths of the Achaians,\n",
      "250\n",
      "and from Ithákē itself, a dozen, all from the best families,\n",
      "and with these Medōn the herald and the godlike minstrel,\n",
      "and a couple of serving men, skilled at carving roast meat.\n",
      "Should we encounter all these indoors, then bitter and desperate\n",
      "would be the revenge that you’re here to take on their violence.\n",
      "255\n",
      "So, is there any supporter that you can you bring to mind,\n",
      "someone who’d gladly step forward to help the two of us?”\n",
      "Then much-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Well now, I’ll tell you, and you listen and pay attention,\n",
      "and decide for yourself if Athēnē with Zeus the Father\n",
      "260\n",
      "will suffice, or if I should find some other defender too.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Good indeed are these two defenders whom you mention,\n",
      "sitting high up there in the clouds: between them they rule\n",
      "the rest of mankind, not to mention the immortal gods!”\n",
      "265\n",
      "Then much-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Not long, for sure, will those two remain mere spectators\n",
      "of the fierce battle, when between the suitors and ourselves\n",
      "where Ares’ strength lies is decided, here in my halls!\n",
      "But for now, at daybreak tomorrow you must be off\n",
      "270\n",
      "back home, and mingle there with the arrogant suitors.\n",
      "As for me, the swineherd will escort me later into town,\n",
      "in the likeness of a wretched and elderly beggar: and if\n",
      "in the house they mistreat me, still let the heart in your breast\n",
      "endure the sight of the pain I suffer; I may be dragged\n",
      "275\n",
      "by the heels through the house, and then thrown out, or pelted\n",
      "with missiles—nevertheless you must look on and bear it!\n",
      "You can tell them to give over their mindless folly, using\n",
      "gentle words to dissuade them; but they won’t take\n",
      "any notice of you; for indeed, their fatal day is at hand!\n",
      "280\n",
      "And another thing I’ll tell you, and you take it to heart:\n",
      "When Athēnē, resourceful counselor, puts it into my mind,\n",
      "I’ll nod my head to you, and you, when you see that,\n",
      "must gather up all the weapons that are lying in the halls\n",
      "and stack them away at the back of the lofty storeroom,\n",
      "285\n",
      "all of them; disarm the suitors with soothing words when they\n",
      "note their absence, and start to ask you about them; say:\n",
      "‘I stored them away from the smoke, since they no longer look\n",
      "as they did when Odysseus left them on going off to Troy,\n",
      "but are blackened with all the fire’s breath that’s got to them.\n",
      "290\n",
      "And there’s a greater concern Kronos’ son has put in my mind,\n",
      "that when you’re flushed with wine you may pick some quarrel\n",
      "among you and wound one another, and so disgrace\n",
      "your feast and your wooing: for iron of itself attracts a man.’\n",
      "“But for us two alone leave behind two swords and two spears,\n",
      "295\n",
      "and a couple of oxhide shields that we can heft in our hands,\n",
      "running up and seizing them; as for those fellows, Pallas\n",
      "Athēnē and Zeus the Counselor will befuddle their wits!2\n",
      "And another thing I’ll tell you, and you take it to heart:\n",
      "If indeed you are my son and of our blood, then don’t\n",
      "300\n",
      "let anyone know that Odysseus has come back home—\n",
      "Don’t break the news to Laërtēs, or to the swineherd, or\n",
      "to any household servant—or to Penelopē herself!\n",
      "You and I by ourselves will test the loyalty of the women,\n",
      "and also make trial of the menservants, find out which ones\n",
      "305\n",
      "honor the two of us, have respect for us in their hearts,\n",
      "and which are indifferent, and scorn you, man though you are.”\n",
      "Then his illustrious son responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“My father, I think you’ll find out the quality of my spirit\n",
      "soon enough: I’m not enslaved by any slack-mindedness!\n",
      "310\n",
      "However, I really think this plan of yours would profit\n",
      "neither one of us, therefore I urge you to reconsider.\n",
      "You’d spend long hours, to no purpose, going round the estate\n",
      "making trial of each individual, while in your halls\n",
      "those arrogant men, at ease, go on squandering your goods!\n",
      "315\n",
      "Regarding the women, however, I do urge you to find out\n",
      "which of them disregard you, and which ones are innocent;\n",
      "but as for the hands at the farmsteads, I’d prefer that we don’t\n",
      "make trial of them now, but take care of that business later,\n",
      "if it’s true that you have some portent from aegis-bearing Zeus.”\n",
      "320\n",
      "Such was the conversation they had with one another.\n",
      "But meanwhile the well-built ship put in to Ithákē\n",
      "that had brought Tēlemachos and all his comrades from Pylos;\n",
      "and they, on coming into the deep-water harbor,\n",
      "drove the black ship ashore, high up on dry land,\n",
      "325\n",
      "where proud attendants unloaded their gear and promptly\n",
      "carried off the resplendent gifts to the house of Klytios.\n",
      "They sent a herald ahead to the house of Odysseus,\n",
      "to deliver a message to prudent Penelopē—saying\n",
      "that Tēlemachos had landed, but had ordered the ship\n",
      "330\n",
      "to sail on to the city—so that the noble queen\n",
      "might not become worried, and shed tears of tenderness.\n",
      "The two of them, herald and swineherd, encountered each other\n",
      "on the same errand, both bringing the news to Odysseus’ wife.\n",
      "So when they arrived at the godlike queen’s abode,\n",
      "335\n",
      "the herald spoke up in the midst of the handmaids, saying:\n",
      "“By now, O queen, your dear son is back in this country.”\n",
      "But the swineherd went up to Penelopē, stood beside her,\n",
      "and passed on all that her dear son had told him to say;\n",
      "and when he’d delivered his whole message, he departed\n",
      "340\n",
      "the courtyard and hall, and went back among the pigs.\n",
      "The suitors, however, were troubled, and downcast at heart,\n",
      "and went out from the hall past the great courtyard wall,\n",
      "and there, in front of the main gates, they sat down.\n",
      "Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, was the first to address them, saying:\n",
      "345\n",
      "“My friends, a great feat has been arrogantly accomplished\n",
      "by Tēlemachos—this voyage, which we thought he’d never make!\n",
      "So now let us launch a black ship, the best one we have,\n",
      "and assemble a crew of sailors as oarsmen, who’ll bring\n",
      "word without delay to those others to sail back home at once.”\n",
      "350\n",
      "He’d not finished speaking when Amphinomos, looking round,\n",
      "saw a vessel there in the deep-water harbor, its crew\n",
      "busy furling the sail, and with oars in their hands.\n",
      "He, with a cheerful laugh, now addressed his comrades, saying:\n",
      "“No need to send messages: here they are back home!\n",
      "355\n",
      "Either some god told them this, or they themselves observed\n",
      "Tēlemachos’ ship sailing past, but couldn’t intercept it.”\n",
      "So he spoke. They now got up and went to the seashore,\n",
      "and the crew drove the black ship ashore, high up on dry land,\n",
      "where proud attendants unloaded their gear, while they\n",
      "360\n",
      "themselves all went to assembly, but would not permit\n",
      "any others to sit with them, either young or old; and next\n",
      "Eupeithēs’ son Antinoös addressed them, saying: “Look here,\n",
      "see how the gods have saved this fellow from harm!\n",
      "Day after day our lookouts perched up on the windy heights,\n",
      "365\n",
      "one succeeding another; and when the sun went down\n",
      "we never spent nights ashore, but out on the deep sea\n",
      "cruised in a swift ship until the bright dawn came up,\n",
      "lying in wait for Tēlemachos, to capture and do away with\n",
      "the man himself: but some deity brought him safely home.\n",
      "370\n",
      "Now we here need to think up some other sorry end\n",
      "for Tēlemachos, not let him escape us; I don’t think\n",
      "that while he still lives this business of ours will flourish.\n",
      "He himself is no slouch at planning and ideas,\n",
      "and the people here are no longer completely on our side.\n",
      "375\n",
      "We must act first, before this fellow brings all the Achaians\n",
      "to assembly—for I don’t think he’ll let up on us one whit,\n",
      "but will give full play to his wrath, stand up among them all\n",
      "and report how we planned his murder, but failed to catch him;\n",
      "and they won’t approve of us on hearing of such low deeds,\n",
      "380\n",
      "and may take low action themselves, expel us all\n",
      "from our homeland, so that we end up on foreign soil! We must\n",
      "arrest him while he’s on his estate, well away from the city,\n",
      "or else on the road. We can then seize his property\n",
      "ourselves, share it fairly between us—but leave the house\n",
      "385\n",
      "for his mother to occupy, and whichever man marries her.\n",
      "Still, if you dislike this proposal, would rather choose\n",
      "that he stay alive, and keep all his ancestral wealth, then we\n",
      "should stop consuming his nice rich store of goods\n",
      "gathering here: let each one of us rather court her\n",
      "390\n",
      "from his own halls with gifts, seek to win her; she’ll then marry\n",
      "whoever offers the most, who comes as her destined man.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and each one of them became hushed in silence.\n",
      "Amphinomos was the next man to speak and address them,\n",
      "the illustrious son of lord Nisos, Arētias’ son. He led\n",
      "395\n",
      "the suitors who came from Doulichion, rich in wheat\n",
      "and pasture; he was the one whose conversation\n",
      "most pleased Penelopē: he had an intelligent mind.\n",
      "He, with friendly intent, now spoke before the assembly:\n",
      "“My friends, I’d myself prefer that we should not do away with\n",
      "400\n",
      "Tēlemachos: it’s a most serious business, this spilling\n",
      "of royal blood. No, we must first learn the will of the gods.\n",
      "If the ordinances of great Zeus confer their approval,\n",
      "then I will kill him myself and urge the rest to do so;\n",
      "but should the gods dissuade us, then I say we must desist.”\n",
      "405\n",
      "So spoke Amphinomos. They agreed with what he said,\n",
      "so they now got up, and left for the house of Odysseus,\n",
      "and on arrival sat down on the polished chairs there.\n",
      "Now prudent Penelopē made a fresh decision: to show\n",
      "herself to her suitors, so outrageous and arrogant;\n",
      "410\n",
      "for she’d learnt in her halls of the plan to murder her son\n",
      "from Medōn the herald, who’d overheard their discussion.\n",
      "Now she went down to the hall along with her handmaids;\n",
      "and when, bright among women, she reached the suitors,\n",
      "she stood by the pillar supporting the close-packed roof,\n",
      "415\n",
      "and, holding the shining veil in front of her face, upbraided\n",
      "Antinoös, addressing him by his name, and saying:\n",
      "“Antinoös, wantonly violent, deviser of evil! Yet they say\n",
      "that you beat all those of your age in the land of Ithákē\n",
      "as speaker and counselor! But such a man you are not!\n",
      "420\n",
      "You madman, why are you plotting death and destruction\n",
      "for Tēlemachos? Why ignore those suppliants who have\n",
      "Zeus as their witness? To plot evil against each other\n",
      "is impious! Don’t you know how your father came here in terror,\n",
      "on the run from his countrymen, who were furious with him\n",
      "425\n",
      "because he’d joined up with a group of Taphian pirates\n",
      "to raid the Thesprōtians, when these were allies of ours?\n",
      "So they were hot to waste him, to rip out his life spirit,\n",
      "and wholly devour his great and abundant livelihood.\n",
      "But Odysseus held and restrained them, despite their urgency.\n",
      "430\n",
      "It’s his substance you eat without payment, his wife you’re courting,\n",
      "his son whom you plan to kill. This distresses me greatly.\n",
      "So stop it, I tell you, and make the others stop too.”\n",
      "Then Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelopē, please don’t worry!\n",
      "435\n",
      "You’ve no need to let these matters disturb your mind.\n",
      "That man does not live, nor shall do so, nor shall ever be born\n",
      "who’ll lay violent hands on your son Tēlemachos\n",
      "so long as I’m still alive and have sight upon this earth!\n",
      "For this I’ll declare to you, and indeed it shall come to pass:\n",
      "440\n",
      "straightway would his black blood gush out around my spear,\n",
      "since indeed me too Odysseus, that sacker of cities,\n",
      "used often to set on his knees, would put morsels of roast\n",
      "meat into my hands, and hold the red wine to my lips.\n",
      "So Tēlemachos is by far the dearest of men to me,\n",
      "445\n",
      "and he has no need, let me tell him, to fear death—not, at least,\n",
      "at the suitors’ hands. From the gods, there’s no dodging it.”\n",
      "Thus he spoke,\n",
      "to cheer her, while planning Tēlemachos’ death himself.\n",
      "She now went back to her shining upper chamber\n",
      "and there wept for Odysseus, her dear husband, until\n",
      "450\n",
      "grey-eyed Athēnē shed sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\n",
      "At evening, the noble swineherd returned to Odysseus\n",
      "and his son, and they set about preparing their supper,\n",
      "having slaughtered a yearling pig. Then Athēnē approached,\n",
      "and standing beside Odysseus, son of Laërtēs, tapped him\n",
      "455\n",
      "with her wand, and once more made him an elderly man,\n",
      "and put threadbare clothing on him, for fear the swineherd\n",
      "might recognize him at sight, and then go off and tell\n",
      "prudent Penelopē, not keep the news to himself.\n",
      "Tēlemachos was the first to address the swineherd, saying:\n",
      "460\n",
      "“You’re back, noble Eumaios! What news is there from town?\n",
      "Are the proud suitors returned by now from their ambush,\n",
      "or still watching out for me on my homeward journey?”\n",
      "To him swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n",
      "“I wasn’t concerned to go wandering all through town\n",
      "465\n",
      "enquiring about this matter: my mind was made up\n",
      "to hurry back here once I’d delivered my message. A swift\n",
      "messenger from your comrades then met up with me,\n",
      "a herald, who was the first to break the news to your mother.\n",
      "And there’s one other thing I know, which I saw for myself:\n",
      "470\n",
      "I was well up above the city—where the hill of Hermēs3 is—\n",
      "on my way, when I noticed a fast ship putting in\n",
      "to our harbor: there was a crowd of men aboard her,\n",
      "and she was loaded down with shields and two-edged spears,\n",
      "and I thought that it must be them, but I can’t be certain.”\n",
      "475\n",
      "So he spoke; and Tēlemachos, princely in power, smiled,\n",
      "with a quick glance at his father, but avoiding the swineherd’s eye.\n",
      "When they’d finished their work and got their supper ready,\n",
      "they sat down to eat: no one lacked his fair share of the meal.\n",
      "And when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "480\n",
      "their minds turned to rest, and they welcomed the gift of sleep.\n",
      "Book 17\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "Tēlemachos, dear son of godlike Odysseus, then\n",
      "fastened under his feet his fine sandals, picked out\n",
      "a sturdy spear, that was comfortably fitted to his grasp,\n",
      "and, eager to leave for town, addressed the swineherd, saying:\n",
      "5\n",
      "“Old fellow, I’m off to the city now, so that my mother\n",
      "may actually see me: I have a feeling she won’t\n",
      "give over her ghastly wailing and tearful lamentation\n",
      "until she sees me in person! Here’s what I want you to do:\n",
      "Take this unfortunate stranger into town, so he can\n",
      "10\n",
      "beg there for his dinner: whoever so wishes can give him\n",
      "a crust and a cupful. No way can I burden myself with\n",
      "the rest of mankind, with these troubles of my own!\n",
      "If this angers the stranger, so much the worse for him\n",
      "will it be: it’s my pleasure to speak the honest truth.”\n",
      "15\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Friend, neither do I myself want to be kept back here!\n",
      "For a beggar it’s better to beg for his dinner in town\n",
      "than out in the country: whoever so wishes can feed me.\n",
      "No longer am I of an age to hang on here at the farmstead\n",
      "20\n",
      "and do whatever some man in charge tells me I must!\n",
      "Off you go: this fellow here will take me as you ordered—\n",
      "when I’ve warmed myself at the fire, and the sun heats up!\n",
      "For the clothes I have on are threadbare: I might be overcome\n",
      "by the dawn frost. You say, too, it’s a long way into town.”\n",
      "25\n",
      "So he spoke. Tēlemachos went out through the farmstead\n",
      "with rapid strides, busy thinking up trouble for the suitors.\n",
      "When he reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, he stood\n",
      "the spear he was carrying up against a lofty pillar,\n",
      "and himself went in, stepping over the stone threshold.\n",
      "30\n",
      "The first to see him by far was the old nurse Eurykleia\n",
      "as she spread fleeces over the richly decorated chairs.\n",
      "Weeping, she rushed to greet him, and the other handmaids\n",
      "of stout-hearted Odysseus now came crowding round them\n",
      "and kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome.\n",
      "35\n",
      "Now prudent Penelopē came down from her chamber,\n",
      "in appearance like Artemis, or like golden Aphrodītē,1\n",
      "and burst into tears as she hugged her own dear son,\n",
      "and kissed his head and both his bright shining eyes,\n",
      "and, between sobs, addressed him in winged words, saying:\n",
      "40\n",
      "“You’re back, Tēlemachos, sweet light of my eyes! I thought\n",
      "I’d never see you again when you sailed off to Pylos—\n",
      "against my will, secretly, to seek news of your dear father!\n",
      "So come now, tell me in detail what sightings you had of him.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "45\n",
      "“Mother, don’t make me cry, don’t stir up my emotions\n",
      "when I’ve only just escaped sheer destruction! Instead\n",
      "go upstairs to your chamber, take your handmaids with you,\n",
      "and wash yourself, put on a set of clean clothes,\n",
      "then pray to all the gods, with full, perfect sacrifices,\n",
      "50\n",
      "that Zeus may one day enact deeds of retribution for us!\n",
      "I shall now go to the place of assembly, and invite home\n",
      "the guest that came with me on my voyage back from Pylos.\n",
      "I sent him on ahead with my godlike comrades, and told\n",
      "Peiraios to take him back to his house, and give him\n",
      "55\n",
      "a kindly welcome, look after him till I myself arrived.”\n",
      "So he spoke: her own answer remained unwinged.2\n",
      "She washed herself, and put on a set of clean clothes,\n",
      "and vowed to make full, perfect sacrifices to all\n",
      "the gods if Zeus would enact deeds of retribution for them.\n",
      "60\n",
      "Tēlemachos made his way out through the hall, his spear\n",
      "grasped in one hand, two hunting dogs following at his heels,\n",
      "and marvelous was the grace that Athēnē shed upon him,\n",
      "so that all the people gazed at him in amazement as he came,\n",
      "and the haughty suitors now gathered all around him,\n",
      "65\n",
      "speaking fair words, but privately plotting trouble.\n",
      "He, however, avoided the main crowd, and went over\n",
      "to where Mentōr, Antiphos, and Halithersēs were sitting,\n",
      "men who from the start had been his father’s comrades,\n",
      "and sat with them, and they questioned him on every detail\n",
      "70\n",
      "of his trip. Peiraios, famed spearman, then came over,\n",
      "bringing the stranger through the city to the assembly.\n",
      "Tēlemachos was not slow to join his guest, but approached him.\n",
      "First to speak was Peiraios, who now addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, send women over to my house now, at once,\n",
      "75\n",
      "so I can deliver to you the gifts Menelaös gave you.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Peiraios, we don’t yet know how this business may turn out.\n",
      "If the haughty suitors secretly slay me in my own halls,\n",
      "and share out all my family goods between them, then\n",
      "80\n",
      "I want you, not one of them, to keep and enjoy these things;\n",
      "But if I contrive death and destiny for that lot, then\n",
      "bring all the stuff to my house, and I’ll be glad to get it.”\n",
      "That said, he took the stranger, so sorely tried, back home.\n",
      "When they reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, they took off\n",
      "85\n",
      "their cloaks and laid them on the seats and the high chairs\n",
      "and went off to the polished bathtubs and had baths.\n",
      "After the handmaids had washed them, massaged them with oil,\n",
      "and dressed them in woolen mantles and tunics, they came\n",
      "out from the bathtubs and seated themselves on the chairs,\n",
      "90\n",
      "and a servant brought hand-washing water in a beautiful\n",
      "golden ewer and poured it over a silver basin\n",
      "so they could wash, and drew up a polished table for them.\n",
      "The respected housekeeper brought in bread and served it\n",
      "along with many side dishes, giving freely of what there was.\n",
      "95\n",
      "His mother sat facing Tēlemachos by the hall’s main pillar,\n",
      "settled back in her chair, spinning fine yarn on her distaff.\n",
      "So they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\n",
      "But when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\n",
      "it was prudent Penelopē who opened the conversation, saying:\n",
      "100\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, I’m going back now to my upper chamber,\n",
      "to lie down on my bed, that’s become a bed of sorrow,\n",
      "always damp with my tears, ever since Odysseus set out\n",
      "with the sons of Atreus for Ilion. Yet you couldn’t be bothered,\n",
      "before the haughty suitors arrived in the house, to tell me\n",
      "105\n",
      "any clear news you may have about your father’s return.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Very well, mother, I’ll give you a true and complete account.\n",
      "We traveled to Pylos, to Nestōr, shepherd of the people,\n",
      "who gave me a warm welcome in his lofty dwelling\n",
      "110\n",
      "as an honored guest, the way a father might treat his son\n",
      "back home from a long spell abroad: with just such kindness\n",
      "he looked after me, both he and his glorious sons.\n",
      "But of steadfast-minded Odysseus, living or dead, he told me\n",
      "he’d heard not one thing, from any man on earth.\n",
      "115\n",
      "He sent me to Atreus’ son, famed spearman Menelaös,\n",
      "in a carpentered chariot drawn by his own horses;\n",
      "and there I saw Argive Helen, on whose account, and by\n",
      "the gods’ will, Argives and Trojans endured such hardship.\n",
      "Then straight off Menelaös, good at the war cry, asked me\n",
      "120\n",
      "what it was I’d come in search of to lordly Lakedaimōn.\n",
      "Whereupon I then told him the whole truth of the matter.\n",
      "At this he responded to me with the following statement:\n",
      "‘I tell you, it was indeed in the bed of a brave warrior\n",
      "that these fellows, cowards themselves, hoped they might lie!\n",
      "125\n",
      "As when in a thicket, the lair of a powerful lion,\n",
      "a doe has laid to sleep her newborn suckling fawns\n",
      "and goes off, traversing foothills and grassy glens\n",
      "in search of pasture, and the lion returns to his den\n",
      "and on both her fawns unleashes a ghastly fate—just so\n",
      "130\n",
      "will Odysseus unleash a ghastly fate on these men!\n",
      "How I wish—by Zeus the Father and Athēnē and Apollo!—\n",
      "that he, as strong as he was that time in well-built Lesbos\n",
      "when he stood up and wrestled a bout with Philomeleidēs,\n",
      "and threw him down forcefully, and all the Achaians cheered,\n",
      "135\n",
      "might come—he, Odysseus—in such strength among these suitors!\n",
      "Then they’d all get a swift end and a bitter marriage!\n",
      "As regards the business you’re enquiring about, I shan’t\n",
      "veer off onto other subjects, nor will I mislead you—\n",
      "of all that I heard from that forthright Old Man of the Sea\n",
      "140\n",
      "not one word will I keep back or conceal from you!\n",
      "He said he’d seen Odysseus on an island, much frustrated,\n",
      "in the halls of the nymph Kalypsō, who by constraint\n",
      "detains him there, so he can’t get back to his own country:\n",
      "for he has no ships with oars, nor any comrades\n",
      "145\n",
      "to further his voyage over the broad back of the sea.’\n",
      "“So spoke Atreus’ son, the famed spearman Menelaös.\n",
      "When I’d done all this, I set out: the immortals gave me\n",
      "a following wind, and a speedy voyage to my own country.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and stirred the heart in her breast with his words.\n",
      "150\n",
      "Then the godlike Theoklymenos also addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laërtēs, truly\n",
      "your son knows nothing for certain!! Listen rather to me,\n",
      "for I shall foretell the truth to you, hold back nothing!\n",
      "Zeus, first of gods, be my witness, and this guest-friendly board,\n",
      "155\n",
      "and the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\n",
      "that Odysseus is already here, in his own homeland, sitting\n",
      "quiet or stealing about, learning of these misdeeds,\n",
      "and planting the seeds of destruction for all the suitors:\n",
      "such the bird portent I noted as I sat on the well-benched\n",
      "160\n",
      "ship of Tēlemachos here, and duly expounded to him.”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“If only these words of yours, stranger, might be fulfilled!\n",
      "Then would you quickly know friendship and gifts in plenty\n",
      "from me, so that any who met you would call you blessed.”\n",
      "165\n",
      "Such was the conversation they had with one another.\n",
      "Meanwhile, out in front of Odysseus’ house, the suitors\n",
      "were amusing themselves by throwing discus and javelin\n",
      "on the leveled terrace as always, in their arrogance. But when\n",
      "the time for dinner arrived, and the flocks were coming home\n",
      "170\n",
      "from the fields on every side, led by their usual herdsmen,\n",
      "then they were summoned by Medōn—who pleased them best\n",
      "of the heralds, and was present at their dinners—saying:\n",
      "“Young men, now you’ve all pleasured your hearts with sport,\n",
      "come on into the house, so we can get dinner ready,\n",
      "175\n",
      "for it’s no bad thing to have meals at the proper time.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and they stood up and obeyed his summons.\n",
      "When they entered the pleasantly sited house they took off\n",
      "their cloaks and laid them down on the chairs and benches,\n",
      "and set about slaughtering big sheep and fattened goats,\n",
      "180\n",
      "and plumped-up porkers, and a cow from the herd, as they\n",
      "made ready their meal.\n",
      "Now Odysseus and the noble swineherd\n",
      "were preparing to leave the countryside, go in to town;\n",
      "and the swineherd, leader of men, spoke first, declaring:\n",
      "“Stranger, since you’re so eager to go off into the city\n",
      "185\n",
      "today, as my master commanded—though I myself\n",
      "would rather have left you here to watch over the farmstead—\n",
      "nevertheless I respect him, and fear that he might\n",
      "reprimand me later, and a master’s rebukes can be harsh—\n",
      "come on now, let’s be going: the day is nearly over,\n",
      "190\n",
      "it will soon be evening, and a little too cold for you.”\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\n",
      "But yes, let’s be going. Be my guide all the way. And give me—\n",
      "if there’s one around that’s been cut for your use—a strong\n",
      "195\n",
      "staff to support me. You said the road was uneven.”\n",
      "With that he slung over his shoulder his worn-out leather bag,\n",
      "tattered and rent, which was held by a twisted cord,\n",
      "and Eumaios gave him a staff that was to his liking,\n",
      "and the two set out. Dogs and herdsmen were left behind\n",
      "200\n",
      "to look after the farmstead, while the swineherd led his master\n",
      "into town, in the guise of a miserable aged beggar\n",
      "propped on a staff, wearing mean and threadbare clothes.\n",
      "But when, as they made their way along the stony path,\n",
      "they’d come close to the city, and had reached a spring, from which,\n",
      "205\n",
      "paved and fair-flowing, the townsfolk got their water—\n",
      "developed by Ithakos, Nēritos, and Polyktōr,\n",
      "with a grove of black waterside poplars that encircled it\n",
      "on every side, and the chill water came flowing down\n",
      "from the rocks above, and up high there was built an altar\n",
      "210\n",
      "to the nymphs, where all travelers made offerings—there\n",
      "Melanthios son of Dolios overtook them while driving\n",
      "those she-goats that were the very best from all his herds\n",
      "for the suitors’ dinner; two herdsmen accompanied him.\n",
      "When he saw them, he reviled them, addressing them personally\n",
      "215\n",
      "in aggressive, unseemly terms, that enraged Odysseus’ heart:\n",
      "“Now here comes a total no-good leading a no-good! As usual,\n",
      "the god’s bringing like and like together! Where, pray,\n",
      "you wretched swineherd, are you taking this old bald pig,\n",
      "this tiresome beggar, this walking blot on our feasts?\n",
      "220\n",
      "He’ll stand and rub his shoulders at many doorposts,\n",
      "begging for scraps, but never for swords or cauldrons!\n",
      "If you gave me this dolt to be a guard on my farmstead,\n",
      "to sweep out the pens and fetch green shoots for the kids,\n",
      "then by drinking whey he could build up his thigh muscles!\n",
      "225\n",
      "But since all he’s learned is bad stuff, he won’t be willing\n",
      "to do real work—he’d rather slouch his way through\n",
      "this district begging, to feed his bottomless belly!\n",
      "I’ll tell you one thing straight, that will certainly come to pass:\n",
      "if he hangs around the residence of godlike Odysseus, then\n",
      "230\n",
      "there’ll be plenty of footstools shied by men at his head\n",
      "that his ribs will splinter as he’s pelted throughout the house.”\n",
      "So he spoke. As he passed, in his folly he kicked Odysseus\n",
      "on the hip, yet failed to knock him clear of the path.\n",
      "Odysseus stood there unshaken, pondering whether\n",
      "235\n",
      "he should attack with his staff, and beat the life out of him,\n",
      "or collar him by the waist, dash his head on the ground.\n",
      "But he steeled himself, and endured. The swineherd stared\n",
      "in rebuke at this fellow, raised his arms, and prayed aloud:\n",
      "“You nymphs of the spring, Zeus’ daughters, if Odysseus\n",
      "240\n",
      "ever burned thigh pieces for you, wrapped in rich fat,\n",
      "of lambs or kids, then grant me fulfillment of this prayer:\n",
      "may that man, my master, return, and divinity guide him!\n",
      "Then would he scatter all those glorious airs that you\n",
      "flaunt in your arrogance now, always strutting around\n",
      "245\n",
      "this township, while useless herdsmen bring the flocks to ruin.”\n",
      "The goatherd Melanthios responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“My oh my, how this dog rants, mind full of malice!\n",
      "One day I’ll carry him off in a well-benched black ship,\n",
      "far away from Ithákē, where he might bring me a fortune.\n",
      "250\n",
      "Oh, I wish silver-bowed Apollo would strike down Tēlemachos\n",
      "today in his halls, or the suitors would kill him, as surely\n",
      "as for Odysseus, far off, the day of return’s been lost.”\n",
      "So saying, he left them behind there, as they walked slowly on,\n",
      "while he moved fast, and soon reached his master’s house.\n",
      "255\n",
      "He went straight in, and sat down among the suitors,\n",
      "facing Eurymachos, the friend whom he liked the best.\n",
      "The carvers set before him a portion of roast meat, while\n",
      "the respected housekeeper brought him bread, and placed it\n",
      "ready to eat. Now Odysseus and the noble swineherd\n",
      "260\n",
      "stopped when they got near; about them rang the notes\n",
      "of the hollow lyre, for Phēmios was preparing to sing for them.\n",
      "Then Odysseus clutched the swineherd’s hand, and said:\n",
      "“Eumaios, surely this is Odysseus’ fine house? It’s easily\n",
      "distinguishable from the rest, even when there are many.\n",
      "265\n",
      "One building’s linked to another, and the courtyard’s fitted\n",
      "with wall and copestones, its doors are finely worked\n",
      "and double-paneled: no man could furnish it better. And I\n",
      "observe that within there’s a feast for many in progress,\n",
      "for the smell of roast meat rises from it, and within it echoes\n",
      "270\n",
      "the lyre, made by the gods an accompaniment to feasting.”\n",
      "To him then, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n",
      "“Easily did you know it, for in all else you don’t lack sense.\n",
      "But now we have to think how we shall act next.\n",
      "You could go first into this pleasantly sited house,\n",
      "275\n",
      "and mix with the suitors, while I stay out here. Or else,\n",
      "if you like, you stay here, and I’ll go in before you.\n",
      "But don’t linger outside too long, or someone might notice,\n",
      "and hit you or chase you off. Do please be careful.”\n",
      "Much-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "280\n",
      "“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\n",
      "You go on ahead, and I’ll stay behind out here—\n",
      "I’m not unused to being hit, or having things thrown at me.\n",
      "My spirit is steadfast, for I’ve suffered many setbacks\n",
      "from rough seas and in war: let this be added to them!\n",
      "285\n",
      "But a ravening belly there’s no way of concealing—\n",
      "an accursed plague, that brings many evils upon mankind.\n",
      "For its sake, too, well-benched ships are armed and sent\n",
      "out on the unharvested sea, bearing ills to their enemies.”\n",
      "Such was the conversation they had with one another.\n",
      "290\n",
      "Now a dog lying there raised its head and pricked up its ears—\n",
      "Argos, stout-hearted Odysseus’ dog, that he, years ago,\n",
      "had bred up himself, but got no joy of, departing too soon\n",
      "for sacred Ilion. Young hunters used to take Argos\n",
      "to go in pursuit of wild goats, or deer, or hares; but now\n",
      "295\n",
      "he lay neglected, his master long since absent,\n",
      "in the abundant dung of the mules and oxen left\n",
      "outside the gates, until the servants of Odysseus\n",
      "carted it off to manure his widespread estate. There lay\n",
      "the dog Argos now, his body crawling with dog ticks.\n",
      "300\n",
      "But the moment he sensed that it was Odysseus nearby\n",
      "he wagged his tail and laid back both ears, and yet\n",
      "no longer had the strength to move any closer to\n",
      "his master, who now looked away, and wiped off a tear\n",
      "that he easily hid from Eumaios, then questioned him, saying:\n",
      "305\n",
      "“Eumaios, it’s odd, this dog lying here in the dung—\n",
      "he has a good body, but I still can’t really be certain\n",
      "if he once had the speed to match his fine appearance,\n",
      "or was nothing more than one of those table dogs\n",
      "that their masters take care of only to put on a show.”\n",
      "310\n",
      "To him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n",
      "“This is indeed the dog of a man who died far away.\n",
      "If he were such today, in body and performance,\n",
      "as he was when Odysseus left him, and set out for Troy,\n",
      "you’d at once be astonished on seeing his speed and strength!\n",
      "315\n",
      "No wild beast that he started in the thick woodland’s depths\n",
      "ever escaped him. He was also a keen-nosed tracker.\n",
      "But now he’s in a poor way, and his master has perished\n",
      "far from his homeland. The women are heedless, can’t be bothered\n",
      "to care for him. Servants no longer directed by their master\n",
      "320\n",
      "won’t perform their duties properly any more,\n",
      "for far-seeing Zeus strips away half the proper worth\n",
      "from any man, once the day of slavery overtakes him.”\n",
      "So saying, he went on into the pleasantly sited building\n",
      "and made straight for the hall to join the noble suitors.\n",
      "325\n",
      "But Argos the fated lot of black death overwhelmed\n",
      "once he’d seen Odysseus again, in the twentieth year.\n",
      "Godlike Tēlemachos was the first by far to notice\n",
      "the swineherd advancing through the house, and at once\n",
      "invited him with a nod. Eumaios looked round and seized\n",
      "330\n",
      "a nearby stool, on which the carver would sit to cut\n",
      "all the portions of meat for the suitors feasting there\n",
      "in the hall. This he took and placed at Tēlemachos’ table,\n",
      "opposite him, and sat down himself. A herald now set\n",
      "a portion of meat before him, with bread from a basket.\n",
      "335\n",
      "Very soon after him Odysseus entered the building\n",
      "as he was, in the guise of a miserable aged beggar\n",
      "propped on a staff, wearing mean and threadbare clothes.\n",
      "He sat down on the ash-wood threshold inside the doorway,\n",
      "leaning back on the doorpost of cypress, which long ago\n",
      "340\n",
      "a craftsman had skillfully planed and made true to the line.\n",
      "Tēlemachos now beckoned the swineherd over to him,\n",
      "took a whole loaf from the exquisite basket, together\n",
      "with all the meat he could pick up in both hands, and said:\n",
      "“Take this, a gift for the stranger. Tell him he should himself\n",
      "345\n",
      "go round among all the suitors, begging. Embarrassed restraint\n",
      "is not a useful emotion for a man who’s in need.”\n",
      "So he spoke;\n",
      "the swineherd, on hearing his order, went up to Odysseus,\n",
      "and standing close, addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, Tēlemachos gives you this, says you should\n",
      "350\n",
      "go round among all the suitors, begging. Embarrassed restraint\n",
      "is not a useful emotion, he says, for a man who begs.”\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Zeus, lord, grant that Tēlemachos prosper among his peers,\n",
      "and may all that his heart desires be accomplished for him.”\n",
      "355\n",
      "With that he received the food in both hands and laid it\n",
      "down at his feet on his tattered old leather bag and ate\n",
      "while the minstrel was still performing there in the hall.\n",
      "But when he’d eaten dinner, and the divine minstrel was done,\n",
      "the suitors’ noisy clamor resumed in the hall. Now Athēnē,\n",
      "360\n",
      "standing close beside Odysseus, Laërtēs son, urged him on,3\n",
      "to go round among the suitors, collect his crusts of bread,\n",
      "discover which were right-thinking, which lawless. Yet even so\n",
      "she’d no plan to save a single one of them from destruction.\n",
      "Off he went to beg of them, moving from left to right,\n",
      "365\n",
      "with outstretched hand all round, as though he’d long been at it.\n",
      "They felt pity, and gave, and regarded him with wonder,\n",
      "questioning who he might be, and where he came from.\n",
      "The goatherd Melanthios now addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Listen to me, you suitors of our illustrious queen!\n",
      "370\n",
      "About this stranger: I’ve actually seen him before—in fact\n",
      "it was the swineherd who brought him back here, but I\n",
      "don’t know the man himself, or who he claims as family.”\n",
      "So he spoke. Antinoös then chastised the swineherd, saying:\n",
      "“You infamous swineherd, why did you bring this fellow\n",
      "375\n",
      "here into town? Don’t we have enough vagrants already,\n",
      "these tiresome beggars who disrupt our feasts? Is it not\n",
      "enough for you that such men should cluster here and guzzle\n",
      "our lord’s livelihood, that you bring in this fellow too?”\n",
      "To him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n",
      "380\n",
      "“High-born you may be, Antinoös, but that was not well said.\n",
      "For who’d himself seek out and invite any stranger\n",
      "from abroad, except maybe some kind of public worker—\n",
      "a prophet, a healer of sickness, a carpenter—even a godlike\n",
      "minstrel, who gives delight with his singing? Such men\n",
      "385\n",
      "are invited worldwide on mankind’s boundless earth,\n",
      "but no man would bring in a beggar to devour his substance!\n",
      "You’re always too severe, more than the rest of the suitors,\n",
      "on Odysseus’ servants, on me above all—although\n",
      "I don’t care, so long as prudent Penelopē and godlike\n",
      "390\n",
      "Tēlemachos are here, both still living in these halls.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Silence! Never waste words in answering this man!\n",
      "Antinoös has an old habit of meanly provoking people\n",
      "with his rough language, and urges others to do the same.”\n",
      "395\n",
      "That said, he addressed Antinoös with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Antinoös, truly you care for me like a father his son, the way\n",
      "you tell me to drive this stranger away from our halls with words\n",
      "of enforcement! May no god bring this about! Take something,\n",
      "and give it him! Far from begrudging you, I command it!\n",
      "400\n",
      "Don’t worry about my mother, or the rest of the household\n",
      "servants resident here in the house of godlike Odysseus!\n",
      "But in fact this isn’t the kind of thought in your breast:\n",
      "you’d far rather eat yourself than give to somebody else.”\n",
      "To him then in turn Antinoös responded: “Tēlemachos,\n",
      "405\n",
      "high-flown speaker, in anger unbridled, what’s this you said?\n",
      "If all the suitors would offer him just what I do, then\n",
      "for three months this house would keep him at a distance!”\n",
      "So saying, he seized and brought out from beneath the table\n",
      "the footstool on which he rested his sleek feet while feasting.\n",
      "410\n",
      "The others, more generous, filled Odysseus’ old bag\n",
      "with crusts and meat. Now Odysseus was on his way\n",
      "back to the entrance, after making free trial of the Achaians,\n",
      "but he stopped by Antinoös, and said to him: “Give, friend!\n",
      "You don’t look to me like the meanest of the Achaians,\n",
      "415\n",
      "but rather the noblest, for you have the air of a king!\n",
      "So it’s right that you should give me an even larger portion\n",
      "of food than the rest, and I’d spread your fame worldwide!\n",
      "For I too once dwelt in my own rich house among other\n",
      "prosperous men, and I often would give to a vagrant,\n",
      "420\n",
      "no matter what sort he was or what he might be lacking!\n",
      "Countless servants I had, and much else in abundance\n",
      "owning which men live well, and are known as wealthy.\n",
      "But Kronos’ son Zeus lost me all—on some whim, I suppose—\n",
      "by inciting me to go off, with a bunch of roving pirates\n",
      "425\n",
      "to Egypt—a lengthy voyage—and meet my ruin there.\n",
      "Well, in the river of Egypt I anchored my curved vessels.\n",
      "Then I issued orders to my trusty comrades, to stay\n",
      "there with the ships, and to be those ships’ protectors\n",
      "while I sent off scouts to find and man lookout posts.\n",
      "430\n",
      "But, trusting their strength, they yielded to wanton aggression,\n",
      "and at once began ravaging the Egyptians’ splendid fields,\n",
      "carrying off their wives and their little children,\n",
      "and killing the men. Word quickly reached the city,\n",
      "and, hearing the shouting, people came out at daybreak.\n",
      "435\n",
      "The whole plain filled up with infantry and horses\n",
      "and the bright glint of bronze. Zeus, hurler of thunderbolts,\n",
      "cast a craven panic upon my comrades: nobody dared\n",
      "to stand firm and face the foe, for trouble confronted us\n",
      "on every side. Many of us they slew with the sharp bronze;\n",
      "440\n",
      "others they led off alive, to do forced labor for them.\n",
      "But me they sent on to Cyprus with a chance-met stranger,\n",
      "Dmētōr, Iasos’ son, a powerful Cypriot prince.\n",
      "From there I’ve come here, with much hardship on the way.”\n",
      "To him Antinoös then responded, saying: “What god\n",
      "445\n",
      "has delivered this nuisance, this spoiler of feasts, to us?\n",
      "You, keep your distance, stand well away from my table,\n",
      "or you’ll soon find yourself in a bitter Egypt and Cyprus,\n",
      "the right place for the bold and shameless beggar you are!\n",
      "You make your pitch to each man in turn, and they give\n",
      "450\n",
      "thoughtlessly, since there’s no restraint and no compunction\n",
      "in handing out other men’s stuff, and everyone has so much.”\n",
      "At this resourceful Odysseus took a step back, and said:\n",
      "“I see your mind’s no match for your looks! You wouldn’t\n",
      "spare even salt from your home store for your own suppliant,\n",
      "455\n",
      "and though at another man’s table, you’re still reluctant\n",
      "to break off a crust and give it me! Yet there’s plenty here.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and Antinoös grew yet more enraged at heart.\n",
      "Staring angrily, he addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Indeed, you’ll no longer get safely back, I think,\n",
      "460\n",
      "out through this hall, now you’re bandying insults too.”\n",
      "So saying, he threw the footstool, struck Odysseus’ right shoulder\n",
      "at the base, where it joins the back; but he stood rock firm.\n",
      "Antinoös’ missile failed to floor him. He said nothing,\n",
      "just shook his head, mind deeply pondering trouble. Then\n",
      "465\n",
      "he made his way back to the threshold and seated himself,\n",
      "and set down his well-filled bag, and addressed the suitors, saying:\n",
      "“Listen to me, you suitors of the illustrious queen,\n",
      "to what the heart in my breast now urges me to tell you!\n",
      "There’s no pain felt by the mind, nor any sorrow, when\n",
      "470\n",
      "a man takes a hit who’s fighting to save his own possessions—\n",
      "cattle, maybe, or flocks of white sheep—but Antinoös\n",
      "struck me because of my wretched belly, that damnable\n",
      "plague, the source of so much trouble for mankind!\n",
      "If beggars have their own gods or Furies, then may death’s\n",
      "475\n",
      "end find Antinoös before ever he comes to marriage!”\n",
      "Then Antinoös, son of Eupeithes, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Sit still and eat quietly, stranger, or go off somewhere else,\n",
      "or the young men may seize you, by hand or foot, for the way\n",
      "you talk, and tear you apart, and throw you out of the house.”\n",
      "480\n",
      "So he spoke, indignant and headstrong, but they all rebuked him,\n",
      "and thus would one of these overproud youths address him:\n",
      "“Antinoös, you did wrong to strike this luckless vagrant!\n",
      "If he turns out to be some god from heaven, you’re done for!\n",
      "And the gods do assume the form of some stranger from afar,\n",
      "485\n",
      "take on any shape, to wander through our cities\n",
      "observing both good governance and its violent transgressions.”\n",
      "So spoke the suitors; but he paid no heed to their words,\n",
      "and Tēlemachos nursed great sorrow at heart because\n",
      "of the blow to his father, yet shed no tear on the ground\n",
      "490\n",
      "but just shook his head, mind deeply pondering trouble.\n",
      "When prudent Penelopē was informed about the assault\n",
      "on the man in the hall, she exclaimed, among her handmaids:\n",
      "“May Apollo, renowned archer, so strike you yourself!”\n",
      "To her then responded Eurynomē, the housekeeper, saying:\n",
      "495\n",
      "“Would that our prayers might find fulfillment! Then not\n",
      "one of these men would live till another fine-throned Dawn.”\n",
      "Prudent Penelopē replied to her, saying: “Good mother,\n",
      "they’re all our enemies, since they’re plotting trouble for us;\n",
      "but Antinoös is the worst, he’s like black death!\n",
      "500\n",
      "Some luckless stranger’s been going round in the house\n",
      "begging from all the men, driven to it by poverty.\n",
      "All the rest gave him enough to fill his bag, but this man\n",
      "threw a footstool and struck him, low down on his right shoulder.”\n",
      "Such her words while she sat in her room, conversing\n",
      "505\n",
      "with her handmaids, and noble Odysseus was eating his scraps.\n",
      "Then she sent for the noble swineherd, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Go now, noble Eumaios, invite this stranger here:\n",
      "I’d like to show him some kindness—and ask him if perhaps\n",
      "he’s had has some news of steadfast-minded Odysseus,\n",
      "510\n",
      "or has actually seen him: he seems to be widely traveled.”\n",
      "Then to her, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n",
      "“Indeed, my queen, I could wish these Achaians would be silent,\n",
      "he spins such a tale as would enchant your very soul!\n",
      "Three nights I had him with me, and three days I kept him\n",
      "515\n",
      "in my hut—he first came to me after he jumped ship,\n",
      "but that wasn’t the end of the tale of hardship he told me.\n",
      "Like the man gazing rapt at a minstrel performing lays that\n",
      "he’s learned from the gods for the entrancement of mortals,\n",
      "who are ceaselessly eager to hear him, whenever he sings—\n",
      "520\n",
      "that’s how this fellow charmed me as he sat in my home.\n",
      "He says he’s a family guest-friend of Odysseus, and dwells\n",
      "in Krētē, that place where the line of Minōs holds sway.\n",
      "Now he’s come here from there, with much hardship on the way,\n",
      "wandering ever onward. He’s had news of Odysseus, he says:\n",
      "525\n",
      "quite near, in the Thesprōtians’ rich terrain, alive,\n",
      "and bringing much treasure back with him to his home.”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Go, summon him! He can tell me all this, face to face.\n",
      "As for these men sitting outside or here indoors, enjoying\n",
      "530\n",
      "a good time, let them go on, since that’s their fancy!\n",
      "Their own possessions, bread and sweet wine, are left\n",
      "untouched in their homes, and are eaten by their servants,\n",
      "while they themselves, day in day out, flock to our house,\n",
      "slaughter our cattle and sheep and fatted goats, hold feasts\n",
      "535\n",
      "at which they swill down our bright red wine without\n",
      "any restraint. Most is gone now, for there is no man here\n",
      "such as Odysseus once was, to keep ruin from our house.\n",
      "But were Odysseus to come back home, then he and his son\n",
      "would at once exact vengeance for these men’s violent acts.”\n",
      "540\n",
      "So she spoke. Tēlemachos now sneezed, loudly. The whole\n",
      "house echoed ringingly round them. Penelopē laughed,\n",
      "and at once addressed Eumaios with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Please go now and bring the stranger here before me!\n",
      "Don’t you see how my son just sneezed at everything I said?4\n",
      "545\n",
      "It follows that death shall not be unfulfilled for the suitors—\n",
      "to the last man: not one shall escape death and the fates.\n",
      "And another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\n",
      "If I find that in all he relates he speaks only truth,\n",
      "then I’ll dress him in mantle and tunic, the very best there are.”\n",
      "550\n",
      "So she spoke. The swineherd went, on hearing her words,\n",
      "to Odysseus, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, father, prudent Penelopē wants to see you—\n",
      "Tēlemachos’ mother: her heart bids her make enquiries\n",
      "about her husband, although she’s suffered much already.\n",
      "555\n",
      "If she finds that in all you relate you speak only truth,\n",
      "then she’ll dress you in mantle and tunic—things of which\n",
      "you stand much in need! As for food, go beg through the land\n",
      "to keep your belly well fed: those who so choose will give.”\n",
      "Much-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "560\n",
      "“In a moment, Eumaios, I’ll be relating the whole truth\n",
      "to Ikarios’ daughter, the prudent Penelopē! My knowledge\n",
      "of Odysseus is sound, and we’ve borne like hardships. But\n",
      "I’m much afraid of this crowd of dangerous suitors,\n",
      "whose aggression and violence reach up to the iron heaven!\n",
      "565\n",
      "For just now, as I went through the hall, doing no harm,\n",
      "this man struck me, causing much pain, yet neither\n",
      "Tēlemachos nor anyone else came out to protect me.\n",
      "So tell Penelopē she must wait in the halls, however\n",
      "impatient she may be, until the sun goes down:\n",
      "570\n",
      "then let her ask me about the day of her husband’s return,\n",
      "and give me a seat that’s nearer the fire, since my clothes\n",
      "are threadbare. You know this yourself: I appealed to you first.”\n",
      "So he spoke. The swineherd then, after hearing his words,\n",
      "went back in. Penelopē at once addressed him, saying:\n",
      "575\n",
      "“You haven’t brought him, Eumaios! What’s this vagrant up to?\n",
      "Is he scared without reason of someone, or maybe embarrassed\n",
      "here in the house? Embarrassment makes a useless beggar.”\n",
      "To her then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n",
      "“What he says is well chosen, as anyone else would agree:\n",
      "580\n",
      "he hopes to avoid the violence of these arrogant men,\n",
      "so he wants you to wait to see him until the sun goes down.\n",
      "For yourself too, my queen, it would indeed be far better\n",
      "to speak with the stranger, and hear what he says, alone.”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē responded to him, saying:\n",
      "585\n",
      "“This stranger’s not witless: he figures how things may go.\n",
      "For there may well be no other mortal men alive\n",
      "who in their violence contrive such reckless acts as these.”\n",
      "So she spoke, and the noble swineherd then departed\n",
      "and joined the throng of the suitors after he’d told her all.\n",
      "590\n",
      "At once he addressed winged words to Tēlemachos, head\n",
      "held close, so that nobody else could hear him, saying:\n",
      "“Friend, I’m off out there now to guard the pigs and the rest—\n",
      "your and my livelihood. You take charge of everything here.\n",
      "Above all, keep yourself safe, take good care you don’t run\n",
      "595\n",
      "into trouble: many Achaians now have it in for you—\n",
      "may Zeus destroy them utterly before harm can befall us!”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Old fellow, so it shall be. Off you go when you’ve had some food.\n",
      "But come back tomorrow with fine sacrificial victims!\n",
      "600\n",
      "All here will be cared for by me. And by the immortals.”\n",
      "So he spoke. The swineherd sat down again on a polished\n",
      "chair, and when he’d satisfied his desire for food and drink,\n",
      "he went back to his pigs, leaving the courts and the hall\n",
      "full of banqueters. Now they began to enjoy themselves with\n",
      "605\n",
      "dancing and singing, for already the evening had arrived.\n",
      "Book 18\n",
      "Now there came up a public beggar, whose custom it was to beg\n",
      "through the town of Ithákē, well known for his ravenous belly,\n",
      "forever guzzling and swilling. There was no strength in him,\n",
      "nor force; yet his great bulk made an imposing sight.\n",
      "His name was Arnaios: this his lady mother had given him\n",
      "5\n",
      "at birth. But Iros was his nickname with all the young men\n",
      "because he used to run errands for anyone who would ask him.1\n",
      "Up he came now, bent on chasing Odysseus away\n",
      "from his own home, and began, with winged words, to upbraid him:\n",
      "“Out of this entrance, old man, before someone drags you off\n",
      "10\n",
      "by the foot! Don’t you see how everyone’s winking at me,\n",
      "encouraging me to drag you? Yet I’m ashamed to do it.\n",
      "So up with you now, or our quarrel will soon come to fisticuffs!”\n",
      "With an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n",
      "“Sir, neither by words nor by action am I causing you harm,\n",
      "15\n",
      "nor do I resent someone treating you—however large the helping!\n",
      "This threshold has room for us both, nor is there need for you\n",
      "to be jealous of others. It seems to me you’re a vagrant\n",
      "as I am. Prosperity is something the gods will allot. But don’t\n",
      "provoke me too much with your fists, lest you rouse my wrath,\n",
      "20\n",
      "and, old man though I am, I spatter your breast and lips\n",
      "with your blood! Then I’d enjoy much greater peace and quiet\n",
      "tomorrow, since I don’t think you’d then come back\n",
      "a second time to the hall of Laërtēs’ son Odysseus.”\n",
      "Now Iros the vagrant grew angry, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "25\n",
      "“Oh my, how glibly this bald old pig rants on,\n",
      "like some crone by the oven! But I’ll contrive trouble for him,\n",
      "punch him out with both hands, scatter all the teeth\n",
      "from his jaws on the ground, as I’d treat a crop-rooting sow!2\n",
      "Come, gird yourself now, let all these men get to watch us\n",
      "30\n",
      "fighting! Yet how could you ever stand up to a younger man?”\n",
      "So these two, there in front of the lofty doorway\n",
      "on the polished threshold were taunting each other sharply;\n",
      "Antinoös, princely in power, now noticed them at it,\n",
      "and, with a light laugh, addressed the suitors, saying:\n",
      "35\n",
      "“Never before, my friends, has anything happened to match\n",
      "the sport that some god’s brought to this house! The stranger\n",
      "and Iros are challenging one another to a fistfight!\n",
      "so gather round quickly, let’s make a real match of it!”\n",
      "So he spoke. They all sprang to their feet, with laughter,\n",
      "40\n",
      "and crowded about this couple of tatterdemalion beggars.\n",
      "Antinoös, son of Eupeithēs, then addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Listen, all you proud suitors, to what I have to say!\n",
      "These goats’ paunches over the fire, set there for our supper,\n",
      "that we filled first with fat and blood3 —let whichever of these two\n",
      "45\n",
      "emerges victorious, proves himself the better man,\n",
      "stand up and take for himself the one that he chooses.\n",
      "What’s more, he shall always feast with us, nor will we allow\n",
      "any other beggar to join us or to beg among us.”\n",
      "So Antinoös spoke: what he said was to their liking.\n",
      "50\n",
      "Then with crafty intent resourceful Odysseus declared:\n",
      "“Friends, there’s no way an old man worn out by grief\n",
      "can fight with a younger opponent; and yet my belly,\n",
      "that worker of evil, urges me to succumb to his attacks!\n",
      "But come now, all of you swear me a mighty oath\n",
      "55\n",
      "that no one, backing Iros, will strike me a foul blow\n",
      "in reckless mood, and use force to let this fellow beat me.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and they all swore the oath as he requested.\n",
      "But when they’d sworn, and completed the oath-taking, then\n",
      "Tēlemachos, princely in power, addressed them once more, saying:\n",
      "60\n",
      "“Stranger, if your heart and proud spirit are urging you\n",
      "to beat off this man, have no fear of any other Achaian:\n",
      "any man who strikes you will be up against many more!\n",
      "I myself am your host, accepted by these two princes,\n",
      "Antinoös and Eurymachos, sagacious men both of them.”\n",
      "65\n",
      "So he spoke, and they all applauded. And now Odysseus\n",
      "girded his rags about his loins, revealing his thighs,\n",
      "both muscled and large, and his broad shoulders appeared,\n",
      "and his chest and his powerful forearms. Also Athēnē\n",
      "came close and magnified the limbs of the people’s shepherd,\n",
      "70\n",
      "so that even the suitors condescendingly admired them,\n",
      "and thus would one of them speak, with a glance at his neighbor:\n",
      "“Soon will Iros, un-Irosed, have a loss of his own making,\n",
      "so muscled a thigh does the old man reveal beneath his rags.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and Iros’ spirit was severely shaken.\n",
      "75\n",
      "Yet even so the serving men made him gird up his rags\n",
      "and forced him out, terrified, the flesh shivering on his limbs.\n",
      "Then Antinoös addressed a scathing rebuke to him, saying:\n",
      "“Better for you, you braggart, had you never been born\n",
      "if you tremble in front of this man and are so afraid of him—\n",
      "80\n",
      "someone so old, so broken by the hardship he’s suffered!\n",
      "I’ll tell you this straight out, and it’ll happen for sure:\n",
      "if he’s victorious, proves himself the better man,\n",
      "I’ll clap you in a black ship, send you off to the mainland,\n",
      "to King Echetos, dangerous maimer of all mortal men alive,\n",
      "85\n",
      "who’ll cut off your nose and ears with the pitiless bronze,\n",
      "and rip out your privates, give them raw to the dogs to eat.”4\n",
      "So he spoke, and yet greater trembling seized on Iros’ limbs\n",
      "as they led him out to the middle. Both men put up their hands.\n",
      "Much-enduring noble Odysseus was debating in his mind\n",
      "90\n",
      "whether to slam him so hard that life left him as he fell,\n",
      "or hit him just hard enough to stretch him out on the ground;\n",
      "and as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\n",
      "to hit him lightly, and not arouse Achaian suspicions.\n",
      "So after they raised their hands Iros led to the right shoulder,\n",
      "95\n",
      "but Odysseus struck his neck beneath the ear. The blow\n",
      "crushed in the bones. At once red blood filled his mouth,\n",
      "he fell in the dust with a cry, and gnashed his teeth,\n",
      "and drummed on the ground with his feet. The lordly suitors,\n",
      "arms raised, nearly died laughing. And then Odysseus\n",
      "100\n",
      "dragged him out by his foot through the doorway to the courtyard\n",
      "and the gates of the colonnade. There he propped him sitting\n",
      "against the courtyard wall, thrust a staff into his hand,\n",
      "and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Now sit there,\n",
      "to scare off the pigs and dogs! And stop pretending\n",
      "105\n",
      "to lord it over strangers and beggars, you wretch,\n",
      "or you may well bring a yet worse disaster upon you!”\n",
      "With that he slung over his shoulder his worn-out leather bag,\n",
      "tattered and rent, which was held by a twisted cord,\n",
      "and went back to the threshold and sat there. The suitors\n",
      "110\n",
      "came inside laughing gaily, and congratulated him, saying:\n",
      "“May Zeus and the other gods, stranger, grant you all\n",
      "that you most desire, the dearest wish of your heart,\n",
      "for you’ve ended the begging routine of this insatiable fellow\n",
      "in our neighborhood! Soon we’ll send him across to the mainland\n",
      "115\n",
      "to King Echetos, dangerous maimer of all mortal men alive!”\n",
      "So they spoke, and Odysseus rejoiced at the words of omen,5\n",
      "and Antinoös set before him the great paunch, filled\n",
      "with fat and blood, while Amphinomos chose two loaves,\n",
      "took them out of the basket, and set these too before him,\n",
      "120\n",
      "and pledged him, holding a golden cup, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Your health, father and stranger: may prosperity hereafter\n",
      "attend you, though now you’re beset by many troubles.”\n",
      "To him resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n",
      "“Amphinomos, you strike me as a highly sagacious man,\n",
      "125\n",
      "such a one as your father was, whose reputation I knew of:\n",
      "Doulichian Nisos, a man both valiant and wealthy.\n",
      "They say you’re his son: you seem a well-mannered person,\n",
      "so I’ve something to tell you: please listen and pay attention.\n",
      "This earth nurtures nothing of less account than man\n",
      "130\n",
      "among all creatures that breathe and move upon it;\n",
      "for he thinks he’ll not suffer setbacks in the years ahead\n",
      "so long as the gods grant him prowess and his knees are nimble;\n",
      "and when the blessed gods bring him hard times, this too,\n",
      "though against his will, he endures with a stubborn heart,\n",
      "135\n",
      "for the spirit of men on this earth will meet and match\n",
      "the day that the Father of gods and men brings on them.\n",
      "I too was once on the way to a good life among my fellows,\n",
      "but, yielding to strength and violence, did many reckless deeds,\n",
      "because I trusted my father and the rest of my kinsmen.\n",
      "140\n",
      "So no man should ever use lawlessness, on any occasion,\n",
      "but accept in silence those gifts that the gods may give him.\n",
      "Such reckless acts I now witness the suitors committing,\n",
      "as they squander the goods and show no respect for the wife\n",
      "of a man who, I tell you, won’t be absent much longer\n",
      "145\n",
      "from his friends and country—he’s close! May some god rather\n",
      "lead you home out of here, so you don’t encounter him\n",
      "when he’s back in his native setting, for not bloodless, I think,\n",
      "will be the final reckoning between that man and the suitors,\n",
      "once he’s made it home and is under his own roof.”\n",
      "150\n",
      "So saying, he poured a libation, and drank the honey-sweet wine,\n",
      "and then returned the cup to the commander of the people.\n",
      "But Amphinomos went through the hall deeply worried at heart,\n",
      "head bowed, for his spirit clearly foresaw disaster.\n",
      "Yet he still failed to dodge his fate, since Athēnē bound him\n",
      "155\n",
      "to be violently overwhelmed by Tēlemachos’ hands and spear.\n",
      "Now he sat down again in the chair from which he’d risen.\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, put a thought in the mind\n",
      "of Ikarios’ daughter, the prudent Penelopē: that she\n",
      "should appear now before the suitors, flutter their hearts\n",
      "160\n",
      "to the utmost, and thus win still greater appreciation\n",
      "from her husband and son than they’d accorded her hitherto.\n",
      "With an awkward laugh, she addressed her housekeeper, saying:\n",
      "“Eurynomē, I’m now minded, as I’ve never been before,\n",
      "to show myself to the suitors, hateful though I still find them.\n",
      "165\n",
      "And I want a word with my son, to tell him he’d do better\n",
      "not to consort so much with these overweening suitors,\n",
      "who treat him politely, but are plotting his downfall later.”\n",
      "Then Eurynomē, housekeeper, responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“All this indeed, child, was well and properly spoken.\n",
      "170\n",
      "Go now, have a word with your son, don’t hold it back!\n",
      "But wash yourself first, and rub oil into your cheeks—\n",
      "don’t go as you are, leaving your face all tear-stained:\n",
      "avoid indiscriminate mourning, day in day out! Your son\n",
      "has now attained the age that you begged the immortals most\n",
      "175\n",
      "to allow you to see: he’s become a bearded adult.”\n",
      "To her then prudent Penelopē now responded, saying:\n",
      "“Eurynomē, don’t, though you care for me, try to talk me\n",
      "into washing my body or massaging myself with oil!\n",
      "Any beauty I once had the gods, who possess Olympos,\n",
      "180\n",
      "destroyed, from the day when he left with the hollow ships!\n",
      "But go tell Autonoë now, along with Hippodameia,\n",
      "to come here: I want them beside me in the hall.\n",
      "I won’t go in to the men alone: I’d be ashamed to.”\n",
      "So she spoke, and out through the hall the old woman went\n",
      "185\n",
      "to take these handmaids the message, request their presence.\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, had another idea:\n",
      "on Ikarios’ daughter she shed sweet sleep: she lay back\n",
      "and dozed, there in her recliner; all her joints were relaxed.\n",
      "While she slept, Athēnē, bright among goddesses, gave her\n",
      "190\n",
      "ambrosial gifts, to make her seem wondrous to the Achaians.\n",
      "To begin with she cleansed her fine features with ambrosial\n",
      "beauty, a salve6 such as that which fair-garlanded Kythereia7\n",
      "employs when she goes to join the Graces’ delightful dance;\n",
      "and she rendered her taller and fuller in appearance,\n",
      "195\n",
      "and of whiter complexion than freshly sawn ivory. When\n",
      "she’d done all this, she, the bright goddess, went on her way,\n",
      "and the white-armed handmaids then approached from the hall,\n",
      "chatting loudly, so that sweet sleep let Penelopē go,\n",
      "and she sat up, rubbing her cheeks, and said to herself:\n",
      "200\n",
      "“In the depth of my misery soft oblivion stilled my senses!\n",
      "How I wish that chaste Artemis would give me so soft a death\n",
      "here and now, that I might no longer with heartfelt lamentation\n",
      "waste my life away, ever yearning for the unrivaled virtues\n",
      "of my dear husband, a man without peer among the Achaians.”\n",
      "205\n",
      "So saying, she went down from her bright upper chamber—\n",
      "not alone, for the two handmaids followed in attendance.\n",
      "When she, bright among women, came where the suitors were,\n",
      "she stood by the central post of the snugly timbered roof,\n",
      "holding up her shining veil in front of her face\n",
      "210\n",
      "and flanked on either side by a devoted handmaid.\n",
      "At once the men’s knees were weakened, their hearts inflamed\n",
      "by passion: each one of them prayed he might share her bed.\n",
      "But she now addressed Tēlemachos, her dear son, saying:\n",
      "“Your mind-set and thinking, Tēlemachos, have got unbalanced!\n",
      "215\n",
      "When you were still a child, you had more common sense!\n",
      "But now you’re grown, and are on the verge of manhood—\n",
      "and outsiders, seeing only your stature and good looks,\n",
      "would certainly think you the offspring of a successful man—\n",
      "your mind and thinking no longer are on the proper track!\n",
      "220\n",
      "Look at this business that just took place in our hall,\n",
      "the way you let this stranger be so badly mistreated!\n",
      "And what if this same stranger, while sitting here in our house,\n",
      "were to suffer real hurt from such grievous brutality? You\n",
      "would then bear the burden of public shame and disgrace!”\n",
      "225\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos now responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“My mother, I cannot reprove you for becoming angry:\n",
      "I myself now see and recognize all these things in my heart,\n",
      "both the good and the worse, though before I thought as a child.\n",
      "Yet I can’t work out everything with sagacity, because\n",
      "230\n",
      "they drive me crazy, these men sitting all around me\n",
      "cogitating their wicked schemes, while I have none to aid me.\n",
      "Still, the contest between the stranger and Iros didn’t go\n",
      "as the suitors expected: the stranger turned out a better fighter.\n",
      "How I wish—by Zeus the Father, by Athēnē and Apollo!—\n",
      "235\n",
      "that these suitors were likewise now beaten, here in our home,\n",
      "heads lolling, some of them out there in the courtyard,\n",
      "others inside the house, and the knees of all were unstrung,\n",
      "as now that lout Iros sits at the entrance to the courtyard,\n",
      "head lolling, his appearance much like that of a drunk,\n",
      "240\n",
      "unable to stand on his feet or to make his way home\n",
      "to wherever he lives, since his limbs are quite unstrung.”\n",
      "Such was their conversation, the one with the other;\n",
      "and Eurymachos now addressed himself to Penelopē, saying:\n",
      "“Ikarios’ daughter, most prudent Penelopē: could all\n",
      "245\n",
      "the Achaians throughout Iasian Argos see you now,\n",
      "still more suitors would be feasting here in your halls\n",
      "from early tomorrow, since you excel all other women\n",
      "in beauty and stature—and indeed in your sensible mind.”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē responded to him, saying:\n",
      "250\n",
      "“Eurymachos, any excellence of beauty and figure I had\n",
      "the immortals destroyed at the time the Argives embarked\n",
      "for Ilion, and among them went my husband, Odysseus.\n",
      "Were he only to come back now, and give comfort to my life,\n",
      "greater would be my renown, and finer too; but now\n",
      "255\n",
      "I grieve, so many sorrows has some god laid upon me.\n",
      "Indeed, when he was leaving his native land, did he not\n",
      "clasp my right hand at the wrist, and then address me, saying:\n",
      "‘My wife, since I don’t imagine that the well-greaved Achaians\n",
      "will all return safe and unscathed from the land of Troy—\n",
      "260\n",
      "for the Trojans, they say, are most redoubtable warriors,\n",
      "as both spearmen and archers, and also as skillful charioteers\n",
      "driving swift-footed horses, such men as can most quickly\n",
      "decide who’ll win the great contest of leveling warfare—\n",
      "I don’t know whether the god will bring me back, or if\n",
      "265\n",
      "I’ll die out at Troy: the care of all here must rest with you.\n",
      "Look after my mother and father at home as you do now,\n",
      "or with even closer attention, while I’m far away;\n",
      "but if the day comes when you see our son grown and bearded,\n",
      "then wed the man of your choice, and leave this house.’\n",
      "270\n",
      "“So he spoke,\n",
      "and now all this is being brought about. A night\n",
      "will come when some hateful marriage will be the lot\n",
      "of my unblest self, whom Zeus has deprived of comfort.\n",
      "But in this matter sore grief has come on my heart and spirit,\n",
      "for this was never the way that suitors wooed in the past,\n",
      "275\n",
      "when men wanting to court a fine lady and rich man’s daughter\n",
      "would all be in competition with one another, themselves\n",
      "bringing along fat flocks and cows to provide a banquet\n",
      "for the bride’s friends and family, and giving her splendid gifts—\n",
      "not devouring the substance of others, with no payment.”\n",
      "280\n",
      "So she spoke, and noble much-enduring Odysseus rejoiced\n",
      "because she coaxed gifts from these men, and charmed their hearts\n",
      "with sweet words, while her mind was set on quite different things.\n",
      "Then Antinoös, son of Eupeithēs, once more addressed her, saying:\n",
      "“Ikarios’ daughter, most prudent Penelopē, presents—such as\n",
      "285\n",
      "any one of the Achaians might bring for you here—you should\n",
      "accept, for it’s never polite to refuse a gift! But we\n",
      "shall depart neither back to our holdings nor anywhere else\n",
      "until you marry the man who’s the best of the Achaians.”\n",
      "So Antinoös spoke. What he said was to their liking,\n",
      "290\n",
      "and each man sent off a herald to fetch his presents.\n",
      "A large and exquisite robe was what came for Antinoös,\n",
      "finely embroidered: attached to it were a dozen brooches,\n",
      "all of gold, and each fitted with smoothly rounded clasps.\n",
      "There soon arrived for Eurymachos an elaborate golden\n",
      "295\n",
      "chain, strung with amber beads, as bright as sunlight.\n",
      "Eurydamas’ servants brought him a pair of earrings, with triple\n",
      "clustering pendants: much grace shone from them.\n",
      "From the house of the lord Peisandros, Polyktōr’s son,\n",
      "his servant now brought a necklace, an exquisite ornament.\n",
      "300\n",
      "Thus every Achaian provided some kind of lovely gift.\n",
      "But she, bright among women, went back to her upper room,\n",
      "while her handmaids accepted these beautiful presents for her.\n",
      "The men now turned their attention to the dance and delightful song\n",
      "for their pleasure, awaiting the arrival of evening; and while\n",
      "305\n",
      "they were still enjoying themselves, dark evening came on.\n",
      "Then at once they set up three braziers in the hall\n",
      "to give them light, and piled seasoned firewood round them,\n",
      "dried out long since and sapless, newly split with the bronze,\n",
      "and set torches between them. The maids of steadfast-minded\n",
      "310\n",
      "Odysseus took turns lighting them, and he himself, Zeus-born\n",
      "resourceful Odysseus, now spoke among them, saying:\n",
      "“You maidservants of Odysseus, your long-absent lord,\n",
      "go back now up to the chamber where your revered queen is,\n",
      "ply your distaffs beside her—and keep her cheerful while\n",
      "315\n",
      "you’re sitting there in her room—or card the wool\n",
      "with your hands: I myself will make light for all these men,\n",
      "and even if they’re determined to stay up till well-throned Dawn\n",
      "they won’t exhaust me, oh no: I’m a much-enduring fellow.”\n",
      "So he spoke. But the handmaids tittered, and glanced at each other,\n",
      "320\n",
      "and fair-cheeked Melanthō reproved him in shameful wise—\n",
      "she whom Dolios sired, but Penelopē raised and cherished\n",
      "like a daughter, and gave her all the toys she wanted.\n",
      "Yet not even so did she share any part of Penelopē’s sorrow,\n",
      "but was having sex with Eurymachos, was his regular lover.\n",
      "325\n",
      "She now upbraided Odysseus in censorious language, saying:\n",
      "“You miserable stranger, you must be clean out of your mind!\n",
      "You’re not willing to go get your sleep in a smithy, or some\n",
      "public doss-house: oh no, you’re busy speaking so boldly,\n",
      "among all these gentlemen! Have you no proper respect?\n",
      "330\n",
      "Wine’s surely fuddled your wits, or else your mind’s\n",
      "always like this, you’re forever spouting nonsense!\n",
      "Are you above yourself after beating that vagrant Iros?\n",
      "Another man, better than Iros, may soon stand up against you,\n",
      "beat you about the head with his powerful fists, befoul you\n",
      "335\n",
      "with streams of your own blood, and chase you from this house.”\n",
      "With an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus retorted, saying:\n",
      "“You bitch, I’ll go straight to Tēlemachos, tell him the way\n",
      "you talk! Very likely he’ll cut you up, there and then!”\n",
      "So he spoke. His words sent the women scurrying off:\n",
      "340\n",
      "Away they went through the hall, the limbs of each one loosened\n",
      "beneath her by fear: they thought he’d do what he said.\n",
      "But Odysseus stood by the flaming braziers, fed them,\n",
      "one eye on the crowd of suitors, while in his mind he pondered\n",
      "other matters, not destined to go without fulfillment.\n",
      "345\n",
      "But these haughty suitors Athēnē would not permit at all\n",
      "to back off from distressing outrage: she wanted its pain to sink\n",
      "deeper still into the heart of Laërtēs’ son Odysseus.\n",
      "Now Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, began to address them,\n",
      "making fun of Odysseus, arousing laughter in his comrades:\n",
      "350\n",
      "“Listen to me, all you suitors of our glorious queen, while I\n",
      "say what the heart in my breast impels me to tell you!\n",
      "Not without the gods’ will has this man reached Odysseus’ home!\n",
      "The torchlight does indeed appear to emanate from him—\n",
      "from his head, that is, which lacks the least trace of hair upon it.”\n",
      "355\n",
      "With that he addressed Odysseus, the city-sacker, saying:\n",
      "“Would you come and work for me, stranger, as a hired day-laborer,\n",
      "on my outlying estate—your pay would be adequate—\n",
      "collecting stones for the field walls, and planting tall trees?\n",
      "I’d provide you there with food the entire year through,\n",
      "360\n",
      "and keep you well clothed, and give you shoes for your feet.\n",
      "But since all you’ve learnt are bad habits, you won’t want\n",
      "to set yourself to hard work; no, you’d rather beg your way\n",
      "through the district, to keep your insatiate belly fed.”\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "365\n",
      "“Eurymachos, how I wish we two might have a contest\n",
      "in the season of spring, when the days are growing longer,\n",
      "out in the meadow, and I had a well-curved scythe in my hands,\n",
      "and you another one like it, for us to make trial of our work,\n",
      "going without food until evening, and the grass was thick!\n",
      "370\n",
      "Or again, I wish we had teams of oxen to drive—the best,\n",
      "big and tawny, both well fed on grass, both of an age,\n",
      "both equal in drawing power, and of no slight strength—\n",
      "in a four-acre field, the clods yielding to the plowshare:\n",
      "then you’d see whether I could keep my furrows straight!\n",
      "375\n",
      "Or again, if the son of Kronos from somewhere brought an attack\n",
      "upon us today, and I had a shield and two spears\n",
      "and a helmet made all of bronze, snug against my temples,\n",
      "then you’d see me out there among the foremost fighters,\n",
      "and wouldn’t abuse me in speeches because of my belly!\n",
      "380\n",
      "But you’re so incredibly arrogant and rigid-minded—\n",
      "I suppose you think you’re a great and powerful fellow\n",
      "because those you consort with are mean and common?\n",
      "If only Odysseus might come, and return to his own country,\n",
      "then at once these doors, however wide, would be\n",
      "385\n",
      "all too narrow for your flight out through the entrance!”\n",
      "So he spoke. Eurymachos flared up in wrath, stared at him\n",
      "with an angry glance, then addressed him with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“You wretch, I’ll soon punish you for the way you have of speaking\n",
      "so boldly, among all these gentlemen! Have you no proper respect?\n",
      "390\n",
      "Wine’s surely fuddled your wits, or else your mind’s\n",
      "always like this, you’re forever spouting nonsense!\n",
      "Are you above yourself after beating that vagrant Iros?”\n",
      "So saying, he snatched up a footstool; but Odysseus\n",
      "ducked down at Doulichian Amphinomos’ knees in reaction to\n",
      "395\n",
      "Eurymachos, whose throw instead hit the wine bearer’s\n",
      "right hand, so that his pitcher fell to the ground with a clang,\n",
      "while he himself groaned, collapsed backward in the dust.\n",
      "The suitors now burst into uproar throughout the shadowy halls,\n",
      "and thus would one of them speak, with a glance at his neighbor:\n",
      "400\n",
      "“I wish this stranger had died somewhere else in his wanderings\n",
      "before he came here! Then he’d never have raised such a tumult!\n",
      "But now we’re at odds over beggars, there’ll be no pleasure\n",
      "in our privileged feasting, since meaner ways prevail.”\n",
      "Tēlemachos, princely in power, also addressed them, saying:\n",
      "405\n",
      "“Foolish sirs, you are crazy! You no longer hide the effects\n",
      "of your swilling and guzzling—some god must be stirring you up!\n",
      "You’ve feasted well: go home now, lie down and rest—of course\n",
      "when the mood takes you: I chase no person away!”\n",
      "So he spoke. Every one of them bit his lip and marveled\n",
      "410\n",
      "at Tēlemachos because of his bold outspoken manner.\n",
      "But Amphinomos, illustrious son of Nisos, the lord\n",
      "Arētias’ son, now addressed them, saying: “Friends,\n",
      "in response to what has been fairly and justly spoken\n",
      "no man should take offense, make a hostile retort!\n",
      "415\n",
      "Do not abuse this stranger, or any one of the servants\n",
      "now domiciled in the household of godlike Odysseus!\n",
      "No, rather let’s have the wine bearer pour drops in our cups\n",
      "so we can make libations, and then go home to rest,\n",
      "leaving the stranger behind here in the halls of Odysseus\n",
      "420\n",
      "for Tēlemachos to look after: it’s to his house that he’s come.”\n",
      "So he spoke: what he said was acceptable to them all.\n",
      "Then a bowl was mixed up for them by the hero Moulios\n",
      "from Doulichion, a herald and the squire of Amphinomos.\n",
      "He gave it to all in due order: they made libations\n",
      "425\n",
      "to the blessed gods, and drank the honey-sweet wine.\n",
      "Then, libations made, when they’d drunk all they’d a mind to,\n",
      "they all departed to rest, each man to his own home.\n",
      "Book 19\n",
      "So noble Odysseus was left behind, there in the hall,\n",
      "with Athēnē’s aid contriving a plan to kill the suitors;\n",
      "and now he addressed Tēlemachos with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, we must lay up all our weapons of war inside\n",
      "and disarm the suitors with soothing words when they note\n",
      "5\n",
      "their absence and ask you questions about them. Say:\n",
      "‘I stored them away from the smoke, since they no longer look\n",
      "as they did when Odysseus left them on going off to Troy,\n",
      "but are blackened with all the fire’s breath that’s got to them.\n",
      "And there’s a greater concern some god has put in my mind:\n",
      "10\n",
      "that when you’re flushed with wine you may pick a quarrel\n",
      "among you and wound one another and so disgrace\n",
      "your feast and your wooing: for iron of itself attracts a man.’”1\n",
      "So he spoke. Tēlemachos obeyed his own dear father,\n",
      "and summoned his nurse Eurykleia, and addressed her, saying:\n",
      "15\n",
      "“Good mother, please keep the women confined to their quarters\n",
      "while I put away in the storeroom the weapons of my father—\n",
      "fine gear, left in the house uncared for, blackened with smoke\n",
      "ever since my father’s departure, when I was still a child.\n",
      "But now I want to store them out of reach of the fire’s breath.”\n",
      "20\n",
      "His dear nurse Eurykleia responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Indeed, child, I could wish you were always so concerned\n",
      "to take care of the house and to guard the possessions in it!\n",
      "But who, pray, will go get a light and carry it for you?\n",
      "The maidservants would have done it, but you won’t let them.”\n",
      "25\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“This stranger here; for I’ll permit no man to be idle\n",
      "who gets my rations, however remote the place he’s from.”\n",
      "So he spoke; but her answer remained unwinged,\n",
      "and she barred the doors of the pleasantly sited halls.\n",
      "30\n",
      "Odysseus and his illustrious son now both set to work\n",
      "carrying in the helmets and the embossed shields,\n",
      "the sharp-pointed spears; and before them Pallas Athēnē\n",
      "went holding a golden lamp that made resplendent light.\n",
      "At once Tēlemachos spoke, and addressed his father, saying:\n",
      "35\n",
      "“Father, here’s a great wonder that my eyes behold!\n",
      "Really, the walls of the hall and its elegant panels,\n",
      "the roof beams of fir and the tall posts holding them up\n",
      "are glowing bright to my eyes, like a blazing fire!\n",
      "Surely some god’s in here, one of those who hold wide heaven.”\n",
      "40\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Hush! Keep this to yourself, and ask no questions!\n",
      "This is indeed the way of the gods who hold Olympos.\n",
      "You go get your rest now: I shall stay here and provoke\n",
      "more interest yet in the handmaids and your mother—\n",
      "45\n",
      "she’ll weep, and question me about every detail.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and Tēlemachos now went out through the hall,\n",
      "lit by the flaring torches, to bed down in his room,\n",
      "where he always retired when sweet sleep came upon him.\n",
      "Now once more he lay down there, to await the bright Dawn,\n",
      "50\n",
      "while noble Odysseus was left behind, there in the hall,\n",
      "with Athēnē’s aid contriving a plan to kill the suitors.\n",
      "Now prudent Penelopē came down from her chamber,\n",
      "in appearance like Artemis or golden Aphrodītē,\n",
      "and for her they set a chair by the fire, where she always sat,\n",
      "55\n",
      "inlaid with spirals of silver and ivory: this was the work\n",
      "of the craftsman Ikmalios, who’d fashioned a stool for the feet\n",
      "that was part of the chair itself. A great fleece was spread on it.\n",
      "On this, then, prudent Penelopē sat, while her white-armed\n",
      "handmaids came in from the women’s hall, and began\n",
      "60\n",
      "to remove all the leftover food, as well as the tables,\n",
      "and the cups from which these haughty men had been drinking;\n",
      "they threw out the ash from the braziers, heaped them up\n",
      "with fresh firewood, to provide both light and warmth. And now\n",
      "Melanthō began once again to scold Odysseus, saying:\n",
      "65\n",
      "“Stranger, are you still here? Are you going to annoy us\n",
      "all night, prowling round the house, spying on the women?\n",
      "Get out of here, you wretch, be content with your supper,\n",
      "or you’ll soon be thrown out, and beaten with firebrands too!”\n",
      "With an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded:\n",
      "70\n",
      "“Woman, why reprimand me in so resentful a spirit?\n",
      "Is it because I’m dirty and wear mean clothes and go\n",
      "begging my way through the neighborhood? It’s need compels me.\n",
      "That’s the way it is with beggars and vagabonds!\n",
      "Yet I too once dwelt in my own rich house among other\n",
      "75\n",
      "prosperous men, and I often would give to a vagrant,\n",
      "no matter what sort he was or what he arrived in need of!\n",
      "Countless servants I had, and much else in abundance,\n",
      "owning which men live well and are known as wealthy.\n",
      "But Kronos’ son Zeus wrecked it all—on some whim, I guess.\n",
      "80\n",
      "So take good care, woman, lest one day you lose all\n",
      "that beauty for which you stand out among the handmaids,\n",
      "lest your mistress may come to dislike you, and treat you harshly,\n",
      "or Odysseus may return—there’s still hope! But even if\n",
      "he’s actually dead, and will nevermore come back home,\n",
      "85\n",
      "yet already, thanks to Apollo,2 his son’s such a man as himself—\n",
      "Tēlemachos! He doesn’t miss it if one of the serving women\n",
      "in the hall misbehaves—he’s no longer the child he was.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and prudent Penelopē heard what he said,\n",
      "and rebuked the maidservant, addressed her directly, saying:\n",
      "90\n",
      "“Bold woman, impudent bitch, none of your gross misconduct\n",
      "has escaped me—on your own head you’ll wipe it off!3\n",
      "Well did you know, since it was from me you heard it,\n",
      "that I wanted to question the stranger here in my halls\n",
      "about my husband, for whom my grief is great and ceaseless.”\n",
      "95\n",
      "With that she also addressed the housekeeper Eurynomē, saying:\n",
      "‘‘Eurynomē, bring a chair here, and spread a fleece upon it,\n",
      "so the stranger may sit down now and tell me his story\n",
      "and also listen to me: I’m eager to question him.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and Eurynomē at once went off and fetched\n",
      "100\n",
      "a polished chair, and threw a fleece over it. Then\n",
      "much-enduring noble Odysseus seated himself, and prudent\n",
      "Penelopē was the first to start their discussion, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, I shall begin by asking you this question:\n",
      "Who are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?”\n",
      "105\n",
      "To her then resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n",
      "“Lady, no mortal on this boundless earth could ever\n",
      "find fault with you: your fame goes up to the wide heaven,\n",
      "like that of some king, a blameless, god-fearing person\n",
      "who reigns over many valiant men, and upholds\n",
      "110\n",
      "justice: one for whom the black soil bears in abundance\n",
      "both wheat and barley, the trees are heavy with fruit,\n",
      "the flocks bring forth young in season, the sea yields fish,\n",
      "all from his good leadership, and his people thrive under him.\n",
      "So question me here in your house about anything else,\n",
      "115\n",
      "but don’t ask me about my background or my native country,\n",
      "lest you fill my heart with yet more suffering as I\n",
      "recall them; for I’m a man of deep grief. What’s more,\n",
      "it’s not right that I should sit in someone else’s house\n",
      "weeping and wailing: such uncurbed sorrow’s a bad thing.\n",
      "120\n",
      "I don’t want one of your handmaids, much less you yourself,\n",
      "saying I swim in tears since my mind’s deep-sodden with wine.”4\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, any excellence of beauty and figure I had\n",

      "for Ilion, and among them went my husband, Odysseus.\n",
      "Were he only to come back now, and give comfort to my life,\n",
      "greater would be my renown, and finer too; but now\n",
      "I grieve, so many sorrows has some god laid upon me.\n",

      "Doulichion and Samē and forested Zákynthos,\n",
      "besides those who rule as princes in rugged Ithákē—\n",
      "all court me against my will, and squander my property.\n",
      "And so I pay no attention to strangers and suppliants,\n",
      "or to heralds at all, who indeed are public officials,\n",
      "135\n",
      "but waste my own heart away in yearning for Odysseus.\n",
      "So these men urge my remarriage, while I spin my deceits.\n",
      "First, some god put in my mind the idea of a great web\n",
      "in my halls: so I set up a big loom, and started weaving—\n",
      "broad was the web, fine of thread—then addressed them, saying:\n",
      "140\n",
      "‘You young men, my suitors now noble Odysseus is dead,\n",
      "be patient, though eager to wed me, until I finish\n",
      "this web: I should not want my woven work to be wasted—\n",
      "a shroud for the hero Laërtēs, against that day\n",
      "when the grim fate of pitiless death shall overtake him:\n",
      "145\n",
      "then the local Achaian women won’t be able to blame me\n",
      "for a man who’d won so much being left with no winding-sheet.’\n",
      "“So I spoke; and the manly spirit was persuaded within them.\n",
      "From then on, day after day, I’d weave at the great loom,\n",
      "but at night I’d have torches set up, and undo my work.\n",
      "150\n",
      "“Thus for three years I convinced, and deceived, the Achaians;\n",
      "but when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round,\n",
      "and the months wore away, and day after day passed by,\n",
      "then it was that, told by my handmaids, the uncaring bitches,\n",
      "they stole up on me and caught me, reproached me loudly.\n",
      "155\n",
      "So against my will I was made to finish the job, perforce;\n",
      "and now I can neither avoid this marriage, nor find\n",

      "Yet even so tell me your family, where you come from—\n",
      "you’re not sprung from the oak of legend, nor from a rock!”5\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laërtēs,\n",
      "165\n",
      "will you never quit questioning me about my background?\n",
      "I’ll tell you, then; though you’ll give me over to yet more\n",
      "griefs than I have already—but that’s the way of it,\n",
      "when a man’s been absent from home as long as I have,\n",
      "a vagrant who’s suffered much on the road from city to city.\n",
      "170\n",
      "Nevertheless I’ll answer your questions and enquiries!6\n",
      "There’s a country called Krētē out in the wine-dark deep,\n",
      "fine, rich-soiled, and sea-girt; it has in it many people,\n",
      "so many they’re countless: they have ninety cities,\n",
      "and various tongues, one mixed with another—Achaians,\n",
      "175\n",
      "proud native Krētans, Kydōnians, all are established there,\n",
      "with Dōrians in three settlements, and noble Pelasgians too!\n",
      "Among their townships is Knōsos, a great city, in which Minōs\n",
      "ruled from the age of nine, held converse with great Zeus,\n",
      "and was father to my father, great-hearted Deukaliōn.\n",
      "180\n",
      "Deukaliōn sired both me and the lordly Idomeneus,\n",
      "who’d set out for Ilion in his curved ships along with\n",
      "the sons of Atreus. My own famous name is Aithōn;\n",
      "I was the younger by birth, he my elder and better.\n",
      "It was there I met Odysseus, gave him a guest-friend’s gifts,\n",
      "185\n",
      "for a gale-force wind had brought him too to Krētē\n",
      "as he made for Troy, driving him off course past Malea.\n",
      "So he put in to Amnisos, site of the cave of Eileithyia,\n",
      "in a difficult harbor, having barely escaped the storm.\n",
      "He went up to the city at once, and asked for Idomeneus,\n",
      "190\n",
      "claiming to be his dear and respected guest-friend; but\n",
      "it was ten or eleven days since Idomeneus had gone,\n",
      "sailing away with his curved ships to Ilion. So I\n",
      "escorted him to our house, and welcomed him properly,\n",
      "with full entertainment from our rich household store;\n",
      "195\n",
      "and for the rest of the comrades who were with him I obtained\n",
      "from public reserves both barley and bright red wine,\n",
      "and sacrificial cattle, to keep them well satisfied.\n",
      "There for twelve days the noble Achaians were delayed\n",
      "by a north wind so powerful it wouldn’t even let them stand\n",
      "200\n",
      "upright: I suppose some maleficent deity roused it.7\n",
      "But on the thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they put to sea.”\n",
      "Thus he told many lies, but made them seem like the truth,8\n",
      "and her tears flowed as she listened, her stubborn heart melted.\n",
      "As snow will melt on a high mountain’s ramparts, where\n",
      "205\n",
      "the east wind thaws the snow that a west wind has sent down,\n",
      "and, melting, it brims the fast-flowing rivers—just so\n",
      "her fine cheeks streamed with the tears she shed as she wept\n",
      "for the husband sitting beside her. But though Odysseus\n",
      "pitied his sobbing wife in his heart, yet nevertheless\n",
      "210\n",
      "his eyes—as though made of horn or iron—remained\n",
      "unwavering under their lids. Deceptively he concealed\n",
      "his own tears. When she’d had her fill of tearful lamentation,\n",
      "once more she responded to him, saying: “Now I think\n",
      "I need to make trial of you, stranger, and discover\n",
      "215\n",
      "whether you and your godlike comrades did in fact\n",
      "entertain my husband at home, the way you claim!\n",
      "Tell me, what clothes was he wearing, what kind of person\n",
      "was he himself, which companions did he have with him?”\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "220\n",
      "“Lady, it’s hard for one who’s been so long abroad\n",
      "to say for sure: it’s now the twentieth year since he\n",
      "departed thence, leaving my native country! However,\n",
      "I’ll tell you how my memory pictures him today:\n",
      "noble Odysseus had on a woolen cloak, purple in color,\n",
      "225\n",
      "and double-folded, its fibula fashioned of gold,\n",
      "with twin pin-sheaths. On its front was delicately incised\n",
      "a hound with a dappled fawn gripped in its forepaws,\n",
      "watching it writhe: and everyone thought it marvelous\n",
      "how the dog, though of gold, eyed the fawn it was throttling,\n",
      "230\n",
      "while the fawn’s feet were struggling in its efforts to escape.\n",
      "I noted the tunic he wore, too—it shone all over,\n",
      "like the sheen you see on the skin of a dried onion,\n",
      "so soft and sheer it was, and as bright as sunlight,\n",
      "and many indeed were the women who marveled at it.\n",
      "235\n",
      "And another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\n",
      "I don’t know whether Odysseus wore such clothes at home,\n",
      "or if some comrade gave him them on boarding that swift ship,\n",
      "or a stranger perhaps, since to many Odysseus was\n",
      "a good friend, and few Achaians could be called his equal.\n",
      "240\n",
      "I gave him a bronze sword myself and a double-folded\n",
      "cloak—a fine purple one—and a tunic with a fringe,\n",
      "and saw him off properly in his well-benched vessel.\n",
      "And there was a herald with him, a slightly older man—\n",
      "Let me describe him to you, as I recall he looked—\n",
      "245\n",
      "round-shouldered, dark of complexion, with curly hair,\n",
      "and his name was Eurybatēs. Odysseus respected him more\n",
      "than his other companions: they were a like-minded pair.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and stirred in her heart yet more the urge to weep,\n",
      "since she recognized the sure signs that Odysseus had told her.\n",
      "250\n",
      "But when she had had her fill of tearful lamentation,\n",
      "she then responded to him, saying: “Hitherto, stranger,\n",
      "you’ve earned our pity; but from this time on in my halls\n",
      "you’ll receive the treatment that’s kept for an honored friend!\n",
      "I myself gave him those clothes, just as you describe them,\n",
      "255\n",
      "from the storeroom, folded them, attached that bright brooch\n",
      "as an ornament for him! But himself I’ll never welcome\n",
      "returning back home to his own beloved country:\n",
      "an ill-fated day it was, then, when Odysseus set out\n",
      "in his hollow ship to ill Ilion—that unspeakable name!”\n",
      "260\n",
      "To her then resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n",
      "“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laërtēs,\n",
      "no longer mar your fair flesh, nor waste away your heart\n",
      "in mourning your husband—though I cannot blame you:\n",
      "for any woman will weep when she’s lost her wedded\n",
      "265\n",
      "husband, to whom she’s borne children, conceived in love,\n",
      "though he’ll not be an Odysseus, who they say was like\n",
      "the gods. Now stop your crying, and attend to my words,\n",
      "for I’m going to tell you the truth, and hold back nothing.\n",
      "I recently heard news concerning Odysseus’ return—\n",
      "270\n",
      "that he’s near, in the rich country of the Thesprōtians,\n",
      "still alive, and bringing with him much splendid treasure,\n",
      "collecting it through the region. But his trusty companions\n",
      "he lost, with his hollow ship, on the wine-dark deep\n",
      "on his way from the isle of Thrinakiē, for Zeus and Hēlios\n",
      "275\n",
      "made him suffer9 because his comrades had slaughtered Hēlios’ cattle.\n",
      "So they all perished in the surging deep; but him,\n",
      "astride his ship’s keel, the waves then cast ashore\n",
      "in the country of the Phaiakians, who are kin to the gods.\n",
      "These treated him like a god, paid him heartfelt honors,\n",
      "280\n",
      "gave him many gifts, and were themselves quite willing\n",
      "to escort him home unscathed. Odysseus would have been\n",
      "back here long since, had he not thought it more gainful\n",
      "to amass a great deal of wealth by wide world travel:\n",
      "for Odysseus excels all mortals in his knowledge of ways\n",
      "285\n",
      "to profit, a field in which no other man could match him.\n",
      "King Pheidōn of the Thesprōtians told me as much. Moreover\n",
      "he told me on oath, while pouring libations at home,\n",
      "that the ship had been launched, and the crew were in readiness\n",
      "to convey him to his own country. But me he sent off first,\n",
      "290\n",
      "since there chanced to be a Thesprōtian vessel ready\n",
      "to sail for Doulichion, that country rich in wheat.\n",
      "And he showed me all the possessions Odysseus had amassed—\n",
      "enough to support his descendants to the tenth generation\n",
      "were the treasures stored for him there in the king’s domain!\n",
      "295\n",
      "But Odysseus, he said, had gone to Dōdōnē,10 to discover\n",
      "from the deep-leaved sacred oak what Zeus was planning\n",
      "and how he should make his way back to Ithákē’s rich land\n",
      "after so long an absence, whether openly or in secret.\n",
      "Thus, as I say, he is safe, he’ll be here at any moment:\n",
      "300\n",
      "he’s very near now, not much longer will he be absent\n",
      "from his friends and his country! I’ll give you my sworn word:\n",
      "Zeus first, highest and best of gods, be my witness,\n",
      "and the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\n",
      "that all these things indeed will come to pass as I tell you!\n",
      "305\n",
      "Within the current moon’s sequence Odysseus will arrive here,\n",
      "between this month’s waning and the rising of the next.”11\n",
      "Prudent Penelopē then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Would that these words of yours, stranger, might be fulfilled!\n",
      "Then you’d soon know both friendship and gifts in plenty\n",
      "310\n",
      "from me—any man who met you would call you blessed!\n",
      "But this is how, in my heart, I think it will be: Odysseus\n",
      "will nevermore come home, nor will you obtain\n",
      "conveyance—there are no longer such masters in this house\n",
      "as Odysseus was among men—if he ever existed—\n",
      "315\n",
      "to welcome respected strangers or escort them on their way.\n",
      "Nevertheless, my handmaids, bathe him, make his bed\n",
      "with bedding and coverlets and bright-colored blankets, so he’s\n",
      "warm until he comes through to Dawn the golden-throned.\n",
      "Then early tomorrow bathe him and rub him with oil,\n",
      "320\n",
      "so that in here beside Tēlemachos he may sharpen his appetite\n",
      "as he sits in the hall. It will be the worse for any of these\n",
      "men who rudely annoys him: such a man will have no future\n",
      "here from now on, no matter how angrily he reacts!\n",
      "For how will you learn about me, stranger, whether I\n",
      "325\n",
      "really excel other women in mind and prudent counsel\n",
      "if you sit down to a meal in my hall unwashed\n",
      "and in threadbare clothes? Men’s span of life is brief.\n",
      "Whoever is harsh himself, whose mind knows harshness,\n",
      "on him all mortals invoke disaster for the future\n",
      "330\n",
      "while he lives, and the whole world mocks him once he’s dead.\n",
      "But whoever is blameless himself, and has blameless thoughts,\n",
      "strangers will spread his renown both far and wide\n",
      "among all mankind, and many will praise his nobility.”\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "335\n",
      "“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laërtēs,\n",
      "coverlets and bright-colored blankets have been hateful\n",
      "to me ever since I left Krētē’s snow-clad mountains\n",
      "behind me, and sailed away in my long-oared ship.\n",
      "I shall bed down as I’ve done on other sleepless nights:\n",
      "340\n",
      "many the nights I’ve spent on some wretched resting place,\n",
      "lying there waiting for the brightly enthroned Dawn!\n",
      "Nor does the washing of feet bring solace of any kind\n",
      "to my heart: there isn’t a woman that shall touch my feet\n",
      "of all the servants you have here in this house—unless\n",
      "345\n",
      "there’s maybe some aged woman, with a devoted heart,\n",
      "who’s suffered as much in her spirit as I have myself:\n",
      "I wouldn’t have any objection to her handling my feet.”\n",
      "Once more prudent Penelopē responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Dear guest, never yet, of the strangers from distant places,\n",
      "350\n",
      "has a man so sagacious been more welcome in my home—\n",
      "so well-phrased and responsible is everything you say!\n",
      "I do have one such old woman, very sensible-minded,\n",
      "who nursed and cared for that unfortunate man,\n",
      "cradled him in her arms the day his mother bore him.\n",
      "355\n",
      "It’s she who shall wash your feet, enfeebled though she is.\n",
      "Come on, up with you now, my prudent Eurykleia,\n",
      "and wash one of an age with your master: Odysseus, I’m sure,\n",
      "must by now have just such feet and just such hands,\n",
      "for too soon does the stress of ill-fortune age us mortals.”\n",
      "360\n",
      "So she spoke: the old woman hid her face in her hands,\n",
      "shed hot tears, then uttered words of lamentation, saying:\n",
      "“Alas, child, for you I am helpless. Zeus must have hated you—\n",
      "devout heart though you had—beyond all other men.12\n",
      "Never yet to Zeus, hurler of thunderbolts, did a mortal\n",
      "365\n",
      "burn so many fat thighs, such splendid arrays of oxen\n",
      "as you offered up, with prayers that you might achieve\n",
      "a sleek old age and rear your illustrious son. But now\n",
      "you alone he’s wholly deprived of a day of homecoming!\n",
      "He too, I imagine, was jeered at by the women\n",
      "370\n",
      "of far-distant strangers, when he came to some house of renown,\n",
      "just as these bitches here all together are making fun of you,\n",
      "and it’s to avoid their mistreatment and endless insults\n",
      "that you won’t let them wash you; so it’s me, nothing loath, to whom\n",
      "Ikarios’ prudent daughter Penelopē’s given the job.\n",
      "375\n",
      "So I’ll wash your feet, for both Penelopē’s sake and yours,\n",
      "since the heart in my breast is stirred by sorrow. But now\n",
      "take good note of what I’m about to say to you:\n",
      "Many a travel-worn stranger’s made his way here, but none,\n",
      "I tell you, have I yet seen who bore so close a resemblance\n",
      "380\n",
      "as you do—voice, build, and gait—to Odysseus himself.”\n",
      "To her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n",
      "“Old dame, that’s what everyone says who’s seen us both:\n",
      "that we resemble each other closely—a likeness\n",
      "that you too now have noticed, and remarked on.”\n",
      "So he spoke.\n",
      "385\n",
      "The old woman took the bright cauldron, and prepared\n",
      "to wash him. She first poured out a lot of cold water,\n",
      "then added some hot. But Odysseus sat down by the hearth,\n",
      "and at once turned away toward the darker side, because\n",
      "he’d suddenly realized that when she was handling him\n",
      "390\n",
      "she would notice the scar, and the truth would be revealed.\n",
      "And indeed, as she settled in close to wash her lord, she did\n",
      "at once know the scar, of a wound that a boar’s white tusk\n",
      "had made when he went to Parnassos, to Autolykos and his sons—\n",
      "his mother’s noble father, who outstripped all mankind\n",
      "395\n",
      "in thieving and artful oaths, a talent bestowed by a god—\n",
      "Hermēs, to whom he burned acceptable thigh pieces\n",
      "of lambs and kids, and so was quite ready to protect him.\n",
      "Now Autolykos paid a visit to the rich land of Ithákē,\n",
      "where he found the son of his daughter, recently born,\n",
      "400\n",
      "and Eurykleia placed the baby on his knees at the moment he\n",
      "was finishing supper, then spoke, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Autolykos, up to you now to find a name to bestow on\n",
      "your own child’s dear child: he has been much prayed for.” To her\n",
      "Autolykos then responded, saying: “My daughter’s husband,13\n",
      "405\n",
      "and you, my daughter, give him the name I shall tell you.\n",
      "Since I come here as one who’s dealt pain and grief to many,\n",
      "men and women alike, over the fruitful earth,\n",
      "let his name be Odysseus;14 and I, for my part, when he\n",
      "comes as a grown man to the great house on Parnassos\n",
      "410\n",
      "of his mother’s family, where I keep my possessions,\n",
      "will give him his share, and send him back rejoicing.”\n",
      "This was what Odysseus had come for, to get his splendid gifts.\n",
      "Autolykos greeted him, and the sons of Autolykos too,\n",
      "with handshakes and expressions of cordial welcome,\n",
      "415\n",
      "and his mother’s mother, Amphitheē, embraced Odysseus,\n",
      "and kissed his head and both of his beautiful eyes,\n",
      "and Autolykos gave the word to his illustrious sons\n",
      "to get dinner ready, and they responded to his call.\n",
      "At once they brought in a male ox, five years old,\n",
      "420\n",
      "flayed it, dressed it, butchered the whole carcass,\n",
      "expertly cut up the pieces and threaded them on spits,\n",
      "roasted these carefully and then shared out the portions.\n",
      "So all day long until the hour when the sun went down\n",
      "they feasted, and no one lacked his fair share of the meal.\n",
      "425\n",
      "But after the hour of sunset, when darkness came on,\n",
      "then they retired to rest, and embraced the gift of sleep.\n",
      "When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\n",
      "they sallied forth on the hunt, both the dogs and the sons\n",
      "of Autolykos: and along with them noble Odysseus\n",
      "430\n",
      "went too. Up the steep slopes of the forest-clad mountain\n",
      "Parnassos they climbed, and soon reached its windy ravines.\n",
      "The sun was just striking the fields below on its way\n",
      "up from the peaceful and deep-flowing stream of Ocean\n",
      "when the hunters came to a forest glen. Ahead of them went\n",
      "435\n",
      "the dogs, pursuing a scent, and close behind them\n",
      "Autolykos’ sons, among them noble Odysseus, hard on\n",
      "the heels of the dogs, and brandishing his far-shadowing spear.\n",
      "There, in a dense thicket, was crouched a huge wild boar.\n",
      "The damp force of driving winds could not penetrate its lair,\n",
      "440\n",
      "nor the sun with its gleaming rays shine into it, nor the rain\n",
      "pierce right through its protection, so thick it was; and the drifts\n",
      "of fallen leaves had piled up in their abundance round it.\n",
      "Now the boar heard the sound of footfalls, from men and dogs\n",
      "pressing on in the hunt, and out from his lair he came\n",
      "445\n",
      "to face them, back all abristle, fire glinting from his eyes,\n",
      "and stood close at bay. Then, first of them all, Odysseus\n",
      "sprang forward, long spear raised high in his stout hand,\n",
      "ready to strike; but the boar beat him to it, gored him\n",
      "above the knee, tore with his tusk a long gash in the flesh,\n",
      "450\n",
      "attacking him slantwise, but failed to reach his leg-bone;\n",
      "and Odysseus struck him squarely in the right shoulder,\n",
      "so that the bright spear’s point now drove clean through.\n",
      "The boar gasped, and fell in the dust, and the life fled from him.\n",
      "Autolykos’ sons then busied themselves with the carcass,\n",
      "455\n",
      "and the wound that blameless godlike Odysseus had suffered\n",
      "they skillfully bandaged, and stanched the flow of dark blood\n",
      "with a charm,15 then went straight back to their father’s house.\n",
      "So Autolykos, and the sons of Autolykos, healed him\n",
      "fully and well, handed over his splendid gifts, and then\n",
      "460\n",
      "soon sent him back rejoicing to his native country,\n",
      "to Ithákē; and there his father and lady mother\n",
      "welcomed him home with pleasure, asked detailed questions\n",
      "about how he came to be wounded; he told them the way\n",
      "the boar’s white tusk had gored him when he was out hunting\n",
      "465\n",
      "up on Parnassos, together with the sons of Autolykos.\n",
      "This scar the old woman recognized when she felt it\n",
      "in the palms of her hands, and she dropped his leg. It fell\n",
      "shin first into the basin, with a clatter of bronze:\n",
      "the basin tipped over, the water spilled out on the floor,\n",
      "470\n",
      "as joy and grief together invaded her heart, her eyes\n",
      "filled with tears, and her voice stuck in her throat.\n",
      "Her hand reached out to touch Odysseus’ chin, she gasped:\n",
      "“It’s you, Odysseus, dear child, and I didn’t know you\n",
      "until I’d handled the rest of my master’s person!”\n",
      "475\n",
      "With that she turned her glance in Penelopē’s direction,\n",
      "wanting to show her that her dear husband was there,\n",
      "but Athēnē distracted Penelopē’s mind, so she could neither\n",
      "meet her eye nor guess at her meaning. As for Odysseus,\n",
      "he felt for Eurykleia’s throat with his right hand, seized it,\n",
      "480\n",
      "with the other drew her close to him, and whispered, saying:\n",
      "“Old nurse, are you trying to kill me? You yourself suckled me\n",
      "at your own breast! And now, after suffering much,\n",
      "I’ve come, in the twentieth year, back to my own country!\n",
      "But since you’ve hit on the truth, and a god’s alerted you,\n",
      "485\n",
      "hush now, don’t let anyone else in the house find out!\n",
      "For if you do, this I tell you, and it shall come to pass:\n",
      "should some god let me put down these lordly suitors,\n",
      "I shall not spare you, my nurse though you were, when I slay\n",
      "those other serving women, here in my halls.”\n",
      "Then prudent\n",
      "490\n",
      "Eurykleia responded to him, saying: “My child,\n",
      "what’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth?\n",
      "You know how firm my strength is, how unyielding—\n",
      "I shall keep your secret as close as hard stone or iron!\n",
      "And another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\n",
      "495\n",
      "If some god lets you put down these lordly suitors,\n",
      "then I’ll report to you on the women in your halls,\n",
      "which ones dishonor you, and which remain innocent.”\n",
      "To her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n",
      "“Old mother, why tell me of them? There’s no need! I myself\n",
      "500\n",
      "shall take good note and discover the truth about each one.\n",
      "No, just keep my secret, and leave the rest to the gods.”\n",
      "So he spoke. The old woman went off through the hall to fetch\n",
      "fresh foot-washing water, for the first lot was all spilt;\n",
      "and when she’d washed him, and rubbed him well with oil,\n",
      "505\n",
      "Odysseus once more drew his chair back nearer the fire\n",
      "to warm himself, and concealed the scar beneath his rags.\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē started their conversation, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, there’s one small thing I still must ask you,\n",
      "since soon it will be the time for pleasant repose—at least,\n",
      "510\n",
      "for him whom sweet sleep possesses despite his cares!\n",
      "But to me some deity’s brought a sorrow that’s measureless:\n",
      "by day I find my pleasure in mourning and lamentation,\n",
      "while I look to my household tasks, and those of my women;\n",
      "but when night comes, and sleep catches everybody else,\n",
      "515\n",
      "I lie on my bed, and around my throbbing heart\n",
      "sharp cares come crowding, to disquiet me as I lament.\n",
      "Just as Pandareus’ daughter, the greenwood nightingale,\n",
      "at the fresh onset of spring sings sweetly, sitting\n",
      "perched amid the thick foliage of the trees, and with\n",
      "520\n",
      "close variant trills pours forth her rippling song, a dirge\n",
      "lamenting her dear son Itylos, the son of King Zēthos,16\n",
      "whom once with the bronze she slew unwittingly—even so\n",
      "my heart’s torn in two directions, this way and that:\n",
      "should I stay here with my son, keep everything unchanged—\n",
      "525\n",
      "property, serving women, this large and high-roofed house—\n",
      "respecting the bed of my husband and public opinion?\n",
      "Or should I now wed whoever’s the best of the Achaians\n",
      "courting me here in my halls, bringing me countless gifts?\n",
      "So long as my son was thinking and behaving as a child,\n",
      "530\n",
      "he wouldn’t let me abandon my husband’s house to remarry;\n",
      "but now he’s full-grown and has come to manhood’s stature\n",
      "he even begs me to go back home, so concerned he’s become\n",
      "for his patrimony, which these Achaians are eating up.17\n",
      "“But come, hear this dream of mine, and interpret it for me:\n",
      "535\n",
      "I had twenty geese round the house, they came up from the water\n",
      "and I fed them on wheat: the sight of them warmed my heart.\n",
      "But down from the mountain swooped a great eagle, with curved beak,\n",
      "broke all their necks and killed them. They lay scattered\n",
      "all over the hall, while the eagle soared up in the bright sky.\n",
      "540\n",
      "I wept and wailed, although it was only a dream,\n",
      "and the fine-tressed Achaian women gathered around me\n",
      "as I grieved sadly because the eagle had killed my geese.\n",
      "But then back it came, perched on a jutting rafter,\n",
      "and with the voice of a human caught me short, declaring:\n",
      "545\n",
      "‘Take heart, you daughter of far-famed Ikarios: this\n",
      "is no dream, but a true vision, that will surely be fulfilled!\n",
      "These geese are the suitors,18 and I, who before was a bird,\n",
      "the eagle, have now at last come back as your husband,\n",
      "who’ll unleash a grim fate on all the suitors.’\n",
      "So he spoke.\n",
      "550\n",
      "Then honey-sweet sleep released its hold upon me,\n",
      "and glancing around I saw the geese in my domain\n",
      "pecking up grain by the trough, as they’d done previously.”\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Madam, no way is it possible, by twisting its clear meaning,\n",
      "555\n",
      "to interpret this dream any other way, since Odysseus himself\n",
      "has shown you how he’ll fulfill it! The doom of all the suitors\n",
      "is clear! Not one of them will escape death and the fates!”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Stranger, dreams are hard to make sense of or interpret,\n",
      "560\n",
      "and not all of them reach fulfillment for us mortals.\n",
      "For there are two gateways set up for fleeting dreams,\n",
      "of which one is constructed from horn, the other from ivory.\n",
      "Those dreams that come through the gate of sawn ivory\n",
      "are deceptive, bringing words that remain unfulfilled;\n",
      "565\n",
      "but those that emerge from the gate of polished horn\n",
      "presage the truth for anyone who beholds them.19 But for me\n",
      "it was not, I think, from there that my own strange dream\n",
      "came—welcome though that would have been to me and my son!\n",
      "And another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\n",
      "570\n",
      "The ill-starred day is approaching that’s to remove me\n",
      "from the house of Odysseus: for now I shall order a contest—\n",
      "those axes that he used to set up here in his halls\n",
      "in a straight line, like ships’ props, twelve of them all told—\n",
      "he’d stand at a distance, and shoot an arrow through them.\n",
      "575\n",
      "So now I shall order this contest for the suitors:20\n",
      "whoever, handling his bow, shall string it most easily\n",
      "and then shoot an arrow clear through all twelve axes,\n",
      "with him I’d depart, leaving this house to which I came\n",
      "as a wedded wife—a fine home, and full of rich possessions!\n",
      "580\n",
      "I think I shall always remember it, even in my dreams.”\n",
      "To her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n",
      "“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laërtēs,\n",
      "do not any longer delay this contest in your house,\n",
      "for resourceful Odysseus will arrive here before that—\n",
      "585\n",
      "before these fellows can get to handle the polished bow,\n",
      "or string it, or shoot an arrow clean through the iron.”\n",
      "Then\n",
      "to him prudent Penelopē responded, saying: “If you\n",
      "were only willing, stranger, to sit on here in my halls\n",
      "and amuse me, sleep would never be shed upon my eyelids!\n",
      "590\n",
      "But no way can people possibly go without sleep forever;\n",
      "and so to each one of us mortals on this grain-giving earth\n",
      "the immortals have allotted a proper time for repose.\n",
      "So I shall go on back to my upper chamber and lie\n",
      "on my bed, though it’s become a place of mourning for me,\n",
      "595\n",
      "always made damp by my tears, since the day when Odysseus\n",
      "left to set eyes on ill Ilion—that unspeakable name!\n",
      "That’s where I shall lie; but you sleep here in the hall—\n",
      "spread your own bedding, or have them make you up a bed.”\n",
      "So saying, she went off back to her bright upper chamber,\n",
      "600\n",
      "not alone, for her handmaids accompanied her. And after\n",
      "she’d retired to her upper chamber with her handmaids, then\n",
      "she wept for Odysseus, her dear husband, until\n",
      "grey-eyed Athēnē cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\n",
      "Book 20\n",
      "But noble Odysseus bedded down for sleep in the forecourt.\n",
      "On the ground he spread out an undressed oxhide, above it\n",
      "putting many fleeces from sheep the Achaians had sacrificed;\n",
      "and when he settled, Eurynomē threw a cloak over him.\n",
      "So Odysseus, brooding on evil for the suitors in his heart\n",
      "5\n",
      "lay there, still wakeful. And then from their hall the women\n",
      "emerged—those who had taken to sleeping with the suitors—\n",
      "laughing and chattering cheerfully one to another; and rage\n",
      "erupted now in his breast, and much he debated,\n",
      "emotion and reason competing for his decision, whether\n",
      "10\n",
      "to get up and rush them now, deal death to each one of them,\n",
      "or leave them to couple one last and final time\n",
      "with these arrogant suitors. And his inner heart was growling\n",
      "as a bitch standing over her helpless puppies will growl\n",
      "at some unfamiliar man, more than ready to fight him: so\n",
      "15\n",
      "his heart growled within him, enraged at their bad behavior.\n",
      "But he beat his breast, and upbraided his heart, declaring:\n",
      "“Endure, my heart! Worse than this you once endured\n",
      "that day when the Kyklōps, unmatchable in his strength,\n",
      "was eating my valiant comrades; but you held on, till my plan\n",
      "20\n",
      "brought you safe out of that cave where you thought you’d die.”\n",
      "So he spoke, addressing the dear spirit in his breast.\n",
      "In full obedience to him, his heart now endured\n",
      "without pause; but he himself kept tossing and turning.\n",
      "As a man cooking a paunch chockful of fat and blood\n",
      "25\n",
      "on a fierce blazing fire will turn it to and fro,\n",
      "determined to get it cooked through as fast as he can,\n",
      "so Odysseus tossed this way and that, trying to work out\n",
      "how he was going to lay hands on the shameless suitors,\n",
      "one man against so many. Then Athēnē approached him,\n",
      "30\n",
      "down from the sky, in appearance like a woman,\n",
      "and stood above his head, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Wakeful again, you most ill-fated of all mortals?\n",
      "This is your own house, and in this house are your wife\n",
      "and son—such a son indeed as anybody might pray for!”\n",
      "35\n",
      "To her then resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n",
      "“Yes indeed, goddess, all you’ve said is right and proper.\n",
      "But here is what the heart in my breast is debating:\n",
      "how I’m going to lay hands on these shameless suitors,\n",
      "alone, while they’re always in a body when they’re here.\n",
      "40\n",
      "What’s more, there’s this greater problem that I’m facing:\n",
      "even if—both Zeus and you willing—I do kill them,\n",
      "how then would I make my escape? Please consider that!”\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Stubborn man! There are many who’d trust a weaker comrade—\n",
      "45\n",
      "a mortal, without any knowledge of such wisdom as mine!\n",
      "But I am a god, one who guards you through to the end\n",
      "in all your endeavors! And I’ll tell you this openly:\n",
      "if there were fifty troops of mortal men in ambush\n",
      "all round us, firmly determined to kill us, nevertheless\n",
      "50\n",
      "even then you’d drive off with their cattle and fattened sheep!\n",
      "But for now let sleep overtake you. To stay awake on watch\n",
      "all night is a bad thing too. Soon you’ll be free of troubles.”\n",
      "So she spoke, and shed sleep on his eyelids, but herself,\n",
      "bright among goddesses, made her way back to Olympos.\n",
      "55\n",
      "While sleep, the limb-loosener, still had hold of him,\n",
      "relaxing the cares of his heart, his affectionate wife\n",
      "awoke and wept, sitting up there, still in her soft bed.\n",
      "But when her spirit had had its fill of weeping, then she,\n",
      "bright among women, first prayed to Artemis, saying:\n",
      "60\n",
      "“Artemis, lady goddess, daughter of Zeus, how I wish\n",
      "you’d shoot a shaft into my breast and take away my life\n",
      "now, at this instant, or a storm wind would snatch me up,\n",
      "whirl me away along those dark murky pathways,\n",
      "cast me forth at the mouth of refluent Ocean, as once\n",
      "65\n",
      "storm winds carried away Pandareus’ daughters! The gods\n",
      "had killed their parents, and they were left abandoned\n",
      "as orphans there in the halls, and were cared for by Aphrodītē\n",
      "with cheese and sweet honey and pleasant-tasting wine;\n",
      "and Hērē bestowed on them, above all other women,\n",
      "70\n",
      "beauty and wisdom, while chaste Artemis gave them stature,\n",
      "and Athēnē made them accomplished in elegant handiwork.\n",
      "But while bright Aphrodītē was making for high Olympos—\n",
      "to Zeus, with his joy in the thunderbolt, for well he knows all,\n",
      "both the good fortune and the misfortunes of transient mortals—\n",
      "75\n",
      "to ask for these girls the fulfillment of a healthy marriage,\n",
      "the storm winds’ spirits meanwhile snatched them away\n",
      "and surrendered them to the mercy of the loathsome Furies.1\n",
      "So, I wish, might those powers whose homes are on Olympos\n",
      "annihilate me, or fair-tressed Artemis strike me—Odysseus\n",
      "80\n",
      "would be in my mind’s eye as I went under this hated earth,\n",
      "and I’d never pleasure the thoughts of any lesser husband!\n",
      "Yet the burden’s endurable for anyone who weeps\n",
      "in the daytime, constantly moved by deep distress at heart,\n",
      "but is mastered by sleep at night, for sleep brings forgetfulness\n",
      "85\n",
      "of all things, both good and bad, once it’s shrouded the eyelids.\n",
      "Yet on me some god laid the burden of evil dreams as well,\n",
      "for this night there lay in my arms one exactly like him,\n",
      "as he was when he left with his troops, and so my spirit\n",
      "rejoiced, for I thought it no dream, but rather a waking vision.”\n",
      "90\n",
      "So she spoke, and straightway Dawn, the golden-throned, came up.\n",
      "The sound of her voice, weeping, got through to noble Odysseus:\n",
      "he tried to think, and it seemed to his half-asleep mind\n",
      "that she’d recognized him and was standing there at his head.\n",
      "Then he picked up the cloak, and the fleeces that he’d slept on,\n",
      "95\n",
      "put them down on a chair in the hall, and carried the oxhide\n",
      "outside, and left it. Hands raised, he then made his prayer to Zeus:\n",
      "“Zeus, Father, if willingly you gods have now brought me back\n",
      "over dry and wet to my country, after troubling me so much,\n",
      "let one of those waking inside speak a word of omen for me,\n",
      "100\n",
      "and out here a sign from Zeus be made manifest as well.”\n",
      "So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus the Counselor heard him.\n",
      "At once he delivered thunder from gleaming Olympos\n",
      "on high out of the clouds, and noble Odysseus rejoiced.\n",
      "And a woman, a grinder of grain, sent forth a word of omen\n",
      "105\n",
      "from the house nearby where the mills of the people’s shepherd\n",
      "were set. At these twelve women all told were workers,\n",
      "grinding barley and wheat, men’s marrow. By now the others\n",
      "were all asleep, having ground their quota of wheat, and she\n",
      "was the only one who’d not finished, for she was the weakest.\n",
      "110\n",
      "She stopped her quern now and uttered an omen for her lord:\n",
      "“Zeus, Father, lord over gods and men, how loudly\n",
      "you thundered out of the starry sky, yet nowhere is there\n",
      "any trace of cloud: this must be a portent you’re granting someone!\n",
      "Then fulfill for poor me too the wish I shall now pronounce:\n",
      "115\n",
      "May this be the final and latest day on which these suitors\n",
      "enjoy their delectable feast in the halls of Odysseus, they\n",
      "who’ve weakened my knees with so much agonizing labor\n",
      "grinding their grain: may this dinner be their last!”\n",
      "So she spoke: noble Odysseus rejoiced at the words of omen\n",
      "120\n",
      "and the thunder of Zeus, as he planned revenge upon the guilty.\n",
      "The other serving women in Odysseus’ splendid house\n",
      "were up now. They rekindled unwearying fire on the hearth,\n",
      "and Tēlemachos rose from his bed, a godlike mortal,\n",
      "put on his clothes, slung a sharp sword from his shoulder,\n",
      "125\n",
      "bound on a pair of fine sandals under his sleek feet,\n",
      "picked out a sturdy spear, tipped with keen bronze, and went\n",
      "and stood at the threshold, and then addressed Eurykleia, saying:\n",
      "“Dear nurse, have you honored the stranger in our house\n",
      "with a bed and food, or does he lie as he is, uncared-for?\n",
      "130\n",
      "Clever my mother may be, but that’s her way: on impulse\n",
      "she’ll do the honors for some person who’s entirely\n",
      "unimportant, yet dismiss his better with no respect.”\n",
      "To him then prudent Eurykleia responded, saying: “Child,\n",
      "in this case you shouldn’t blame her, when she’s blameless.\n",
      "135\n",
      "He sat there drinking wine as long as he’d a mind to,\n",
      "but for food he said he’d no more appetite: she asked him.\n",
      "Then later, when his thoughts turned to lying down and sleep,\n",
      "she told her serving women to make up a bed for him;\n",
      "but he—like some totally wretched and ill-fated person—\n",
      "140\n",
      "didn’t want to sleep in a bed or under blankets, but chose\n",
      "to doss down on an undressed oxhide and fleeces of sheep\n",
      "in the forecourt: we had to throw a cloak over him.”\n",
      "So she spoke. Tēlemachos made his way out through the hall,\n",
      "spear in hand, two hunting dogs at his heels, and went\n",
      "145\n",
      "to the place of assembly to join the well-greaved Achaians.\n",
      "Now Eurykleia, bright among women—daughter of Ōps,\n",
      "Peisēnōr’s son—addressed the handmaids, saying: “To work!\n",
      "Some of you busy yourselves with sweeping the house out,\n",
      "sprinkling the floors, and dressing the well-made chairs\n",
      "150\n",
      "with their purple coverlets; others wipe off all the tables\n",
      "with sponges, wash clean the mixing-bowls and the crafted\n",
      "two-handled drinking cups; others go fetch water\n",
      "from the spring—and move smartly, get it back here soon!\n",
      "For the suitors won’t be long absent from the hall: they’ll return\n",
      "155\n",
      "good and early: this is a public feast day.”\n",
      "So she spoke,\n",
      "and each one listened with care and did what she ordered:\n",
      "twenty set off to the spring of dark water, while the rest\n",
      "went knowledgeably about their various tasks in the house.\n",
      "Then in came the spirited menservants and began\n",
      "160\n",
      "to split logs well and skillfully, while the women\n",
      "returned from the spring; and after them came the swineherd\n",
      "driving three hogs, the best ones of all that he had;\n",
      "these he let out to graze in the lush enclosures,\n",
      "and himself put a friendly query to Odysseus, saying:\n",
      "165\n",
      "“Stranger, do the Achaians show you more regard now?\n",
      "Or are they still insulting you here in the hall, as before?”\n",
      "To him resourceful Odysseus responded, saying: “Eumaios,\n",
      "would that the gods might exact requital for the outrage\n",
      "of these men, who in their arrogance behave so recklessly\n",
      "170\n",
      "in another man’s house, and have no sense of shame.”\n",
      "Such was the conversation they had with one another.\n",
      "Then up to them came Melanthios, the goatherd, driving\n",
      "those she-goats that were the finest of all in his flocks\n",
      "to make a meal for the suitors. Two herdsmen accompanied him.\n",
      "175\n",
      "The goats he tethered beneath the echoing colonnade,\n",
      "then addressed Odysseus abusively, saying: “Stranger,\n",
      "won’t you ever stop making yourself a nuisance in this house,\n",
      "begging alms from the men here? Can’t you get out and stay out?\n",
      "I’m pretty sure that we two won’t part company until\n",
      "180\n",
      "we’ve sampled each other’s fists, since your begging isn’t done\n",
      "in the proper way. And besides, there are other Achaian feasts.”\n",
      "So he spoke. Resourceful Odysseus made him no answer,\n",
      "but shook his head in silence, mind brooding on trouble.\n",
      "The third to arrive beside these was Philoitios, leader of men,\n",
      "185\n",
      "driving up for the suitors a barren heifer and she-goats\n",
      "brought over by ferrymen, who also convey others,\n",
      "travelers, whoever approaches them for passage.\n",
      "The beasts he tethered with care in the echoing colonnade,\n",
      "and then went up to the swineherd, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "190\n",
      "“Who is this stranger, swineherd, who’s recently arrived\n",
      "here in our house? From what men does he claim descent?\n",
      "Where is his family? What is the country of his birth?\n",
      "Ill-fated, yes, but he still has the mien of a lord, a king—\n",
      "though the gods do afflict men who wander far and wide,\n",
      "195\n",
      "spinning a wretched fate for them, princes though they be.”\n",
      "With that he turned to Odysseus, hand outstretched in greeting,\n",
      "and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Stranger, father,\n",
      "all hail to you! May prosperity be your lot hereafter,\n",
      "though now you’re weighed down by plentiful misfortunes!\n",
      "200\n",
      "Zeus, Father, no other god’s more lethal than you are:\n",
      "once you’ve created men, you show them no pity for\n",
      "the hardship and miserable suffering they must endure!\n",
      "I broke sweat at the sight of you, my eyes are full of tears\n",
      "as I remember Odysseus, for I fancy he too must be\n",
      "205\n",
      "clothed in just such rags as he wanders among men—\n",
      "that is, if he’s still living, and sees the light of the sun!\n",
      "But if he’s already dead, down in Hades’ realm, then woe\n",
      "is me for peerless Odysseus, who put me in charge\n",
      "of his cattle, when I was a boy still, in Kephallēnian country.\n",
      "210\n",
      "By now they’ve bred past counting: no other way\n",
      "could you get a better harvest of broad-browed cattle!\n",
      "But others now order me to drive these cows in for them\n",
      "to eat! They pay no attention to the son of the house,\n",
      "nor does the gods’ wrath scare them: these days they’re bent\n",
      "215\n",
      "on sharing out the possessions of their long-absent lord!\n",
      "Here is a problem that the heart in my breast turns over\n",
      "endlessly: it would be wrong, while the son’s still alive,\n",
      "to take off, cattle and all, to the district of others,\n",
      "to alien folk: yet it’s worse to stay on here, and suffer\n",
      "220\n",
      "misery tending steers now claimed by somebody else!\n",
      "Long since, indeed, I’d have fled to some other strong prince,\n",
      "since life here’s no longer endurable; but I still think\n",
      "of that unfortunate man, who might yet come back\n",
      "from wherever, and scatter the suitors throughout his house.”\n",
      "225\n",
      "To him resourceful Odysseus responded, saying: “Cowherd,\n",
      "since you seem neither ill-intentioned nor witless, and I\n",
      "can recognize for myself the good sense of your mind,\n",
      "I will speak out, and swear a great oath in confirmation:\n",
      "Zeus, first of gods, be my witness, and this guest-friendly board,\n",
      "230\n",
      "and the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\n",
      "that indeed while you are here Odysseus shall come home,\n",
      "and with your own eyes you shall see, if you’re so minded,\n",
      "the slaughter of the suitors, now lording it here.”\n",
      "To him\n",
      "then responded the herder of cattle, saying: “How I wish,\n",
      "235\n",
      "stranger, that Kronos’ son would fulfill these words of yours—\n",
      "Then you’d discover my strength, and how my hands enforce it!”\n",
      "In like manner Eumaios now prayed to all the gods\n",
      "that quick-witted Odysseus might come back to his own home.\n",
      "Such was the conversation they had with one another.\n",
      "240\n",
      "Meanwhile the suitors were busy plotting death and doom\n",
      "for Tēlemachos, when a bird came close to them on the left,\n",
      "a high-flighted eagle, clutching a tremulous dove. At this\n",
      "Amphinomos addressed them, saying: “This plan of ours,\n",
      "to murder Tēlemachos, will not, I fear, end well\n",
      "245\n",
      "for us, my friends: let us rather be busy with our feasting.”\n",
      "So Amphinomos spoke, and his words were pleasing to them.\n",
      "They made their way to the house of godlike Odysseus,\n",
      "took off their cloaks, laid them down on the chairs and benches,\n",
      "and began the slaughter for sacrifice of large sheep,\n",
      "250\n",
      "plump goats, and fattened hogs, with a heifer from the herd.\n",
      "They roasted the innards and served them, and mixed the wine\n",
      "in bowls, and the swineherd passed drinking cups around,\n",
      "while Philoitios, leader of men, served them with bread\n",
      "in beautiful baskets, and Melanthios poured their wine.\n",
      "255\n",
      "So they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\n",
      "Now Tēlemachos seated Odysseus—exploiting his advantage—\n",
      "in the well-built hall, but close to the stone threshold,\n",
      "set a mean stool for him, beside a little table,\n",
      "laid a helping of innards beside him, poured him wine\n",
      "260\n",
      "in a golden cup, and then addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Sit here among these men now, and drink your wine:\n",
      "I myself will protect you from the mockery and the blows\n",
      "of all the suitors, since this is no public resort\n",
      "but the house of Odysseus—his legacy to me!\n",
      "265\n",
      "And you suitors, restrain your urge to utter insults\n",
      "or use your fists, lest strife—and a fight—arise between us.”\n",
      "So he said. Every one of them bit his lip and marveled\n",
      "at Tēlemachos, because of his bold outspoken manner;\n",
      "and Antinoös, son of Eupeithēs, now addressed them, saying:\n",
      "270\n",
      "“Hard though it is, Achaians, we must now accept this speech\n",
      "of Tēlemachos, however boldly his words threaten us—although\n",
      "had Kronos’ son Zeus not forbidden it, we should by now\n",
      "have stopped him short in his halls, clear speaker though he is.”\n",
      "So Antinoös spoke; Tēlemachos paid no heed to what he said.\n",
      "275\n",
      "Heralds meanwhile were leading beasts through the city\n",
      "for a lavish sacrifice, and the long-haired Achaians gathered\n",
      "beneath a shady grove of Apollo, the deadly archer.\n",
      "When they’d roasted the outer meat and drawn it off the spits\n",
      "they shared out the portions and enjoyed a splendid feast;\n",
      "280\n",
      "and beside Odysseus the servers set a portion equal\n",
      "to that which they got themselves: such was the command\n",
      "of Tēlemachos, own dear son of godlike Odysseus.\n",
      "Athēnē, however, would not let these haughty suitors back off\n",
      "at all from their grievous conduct: she wanted its pain to sink\n",
      "285\n",
      "still deeper into the heart of Laërtēs’ son Odysseus.\n",
      "There was among the suitors a man bred in lawlessness,\n",
      "Ktēsippos by name, who had his home on Samē.\n",
      "He, confident in his possession of prodigious wealth,\n",
      "was courting the wife of the long-absent Odysseus.\n",
      "290\n",
      "Now he addressed himself to the arrogant suitors, saying:\n",
      "“Give ear, you proud suitors: I’ve something to say to you.\n",
      "His portion the stranger’s long had, as is right and proper—\n",
      "an equal one: it’s neither decent nor just to short-change\n",
      "any guest of Tēlemachos who may come to this house!\n",
      "295\n",
      "I too, then, will give him a present, so that he in turn\n",
      "may offer it as a prize to the foot washer or some other\n",
      "servant here in the house of godlike Odysseus.”\n",
      "So saying,\n",
      "he hurled with strong hand the hoof of an ox, that he seized\n",
      "from the basket where it was lying; but Odysseus dodged it,\n",
      "300\n",
      "quickly ducking his head, and masked his inner anger\n",
      "with a bitter grimace. The ox hoof struck the solid wall.\n",
      "Tēlemachos addressed Ktēsippos in harsh words, saying:\n",
      "“Ktēsippos, this business only let you escape with your life\n",
      "since you didn’t in fact hit the stranger: he dodged your missile!\n",
      "305\n",
      "Otherwise I’d have run my sharp spear through your body,\n",
      "and instead of a wedding your father would have been busy\n",
      "fixing your tomb! So let no man be seen misbehaving\n",
      "here in my house: I now note all, and grasp each detail,\n",
      "good or bad, where, before, I was only a child. Yet still\n",
      "310\n",
      "we are forced to endure the spectacle of such actions\n",
      "as the slaughter of sheep, the endless consumption of wine\n",
      "and food, since it’s hard for one man to hold back many.\n",
      "Come then, harm me no further in your ill-will—though even\n",
      "should you be determined to murder me with the bronze,\n",
      "315\n",
      "that too I’d rather choose: it would be far preferable\n",
      "to die than to go on witnessing these unseemly actions—\n",
      "strangers maltreated, women servants forcibly dragged\n",
      "and manhandled everywhere in this beautiful building.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and they all were hushed in silence. At last\n",
      "320\n",
      "Agelaös, son of Damastōr, addressed them, saying: “Friends,\n",
      "in response to what has been fairly and justly spoken\n",
      "no man should take offense, make a hostile retort.\n",
      "So don’t treat this stranger roughly, or indeed any\n",
      "of the servants here in the house of godlike Odysseus!\n",
      "325\n",
      "To Tēlemachos and his mother I’d like to say a word\n",
      "as a friend, that might just appeal to them both at heart:\n",
      "So long as you in your breasts still nursed the hope\n",
      "that quick-witted Odysseus might yet return to his home,\n",
      "there could be no objection to your holding on, and keeping\n",
      "330\n",
      "the suitors at bay in your house, since this was the better course\n",
      "were Odysseus to return, back as lord in his own domain;\n",
      "but it’s clear enough now that he’s never going to return—\n",
      "so, Tēlemachos, sit by your mother and tell her this:\n",
      "she should wed the best of these men, who offers her most:\n",
      "335\n",
      "that way you’ll enjoy your inheritance undiminished,\n",
      "eating and drinking, while she can keep house for someone else.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“No, Agelaös, by Zeus, and by the sufferings of my father.\n",
      "who may have died, or be wandering yet, far from Ithákē,\n",
      "340\n",
      "no way am I delaying my mother’s marriage—I’ve told her\n",
      "to wed any man she wants to: I’ll give them countless presents!\n",
      "But I’d be ashamed, were she unwilling, to force her\n",
      "out of this house—may no god ever bring such a thing to pass!”\n",
      "So Tēlemachos spoke. But Pallas Athēnē now stirred in\n",
      "345\n",
      "the suitors laughter unquenchable, sent their wits astray:2\n",
      "the jaws from which laughter issued seemed not their own,\n",
      "and the meat they were eating bloodstained, while their eyes\n",
      "were brimming with tears, and their minds imagined wailing.\n",
      "Then godlike Theoklymenos spoke up among them, saying:\n",
      "350\n",
      "“Wretched men! What’s this horror you’re suffering? Your heads\n",
      "and faces, your knees beneath them, are shrouded in night—\n",
      "lamentation’s afire, all dabbled with tears your cheeks,\n",
      "blood-bespattered the walls and elegant panels;\n",
      "crowded with ghosts is the forecourt, crowded the yard,\n",
      "355\n",
      "all flocking in darkness to Erebos, for now the sun\n",
      "has perished from heaven, a foul fog’s swept over all.”\n",
      "So he spoke; but all of them crowed with laughter at him,\n",
      "and Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, made the first comment, saying:\n",
      "“He’s out of his mind, is this stranger just come from elsewhere!\n",
      "360\n",
      "Quick, boys, out of the house with him, have him go down\n",
      "to the marketplace, since he finds it dark as night in here.”\n",
      "To him godlike Theoklymenos then responded, saying:\n",
      "“Eurymachos, I’m not asking you to provide me with guides!\n",
      "I still have my own eyes and ears and both my feet,\n",
      "365\n",
      "and a mind in my breast in no way wrongly fashioned.\n",
      "Using them I shall quit this house, for I sense trouble coming\n",
      "upon you that none of the suitors may escape or avoid\n",
      "who here in the house of godlike Odysseus abuse\n",
      "other men with violence, commit acts of reckless folly.”\n",
      "370\n",
      "So saying, he walked out of that pleasantly sited house,\n",
      "and went to Peiraios, who gave him a friendly welcome.\n",
      "Now all the suitors, glancing at one another, tried\n",
      "to provoke Tēlemachos by mocking his guests. And thus\n",
      "would one of these haughty youths harangue him, saying:\n",
      "375\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, no one has worse luck than you with his guests!\n",
      "Like this vagrant here, brought in, whom you maintain—\n",
      "always wanting food and wine, no good at work,\n",
      "no strength, nothing but a mere burden on the earth!\n",
      "And now this other fellow, who stood up and prophesied!\n",
      "380\n",
      "If you took my advice, you’d do far better to let us\n",
      "throw these strangers aboard a ship of many rowlocks\n",
      "and send them off to the Sikels:3 they’d fetch you a good price.”\n",
      "So spoke the suitors. Tēlemachos paid no heed to what they said,\n",
      "but sat silently watching his father, always ready\n",
      "385\n",
      "for the moment when he’d lay hands on the shameless suitors.\n",
      "Ikarios’ prudent daughter Penelopē had set down\n",
      "her elegant chair so it faced them: she could now hear\n",
      "what each man was saying, there in the hall. For while\n",
      "they were laughing, they’d also been readying their dinner—\n",
      "390\n",
      "sweet and satisfying, since they’d slaughtered so many beasts.\n",
      "Yet no more unpleasant supper could there have been\n",
      "than the one that a goddess and a powerful man\n",
      "would soon serve to those who’d started such vile misdeeds.\n",
      "Book 21\n",
      "The goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, now put it into the mind\n",
      "of Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelopē, to bring out\n",
      "and set before the suitors the bow and the grey iron\n",
      "in Odysseus’ halls: a contest, and the start of the slaughter.\n",
      "She climbed the high ladder that led to her own chamber,\n",
      "5\n",
      "and with her strong hand picked up the neatly hooked key1—\n",
      "bronze, finely wrought, with a fitted ivory handle—\n",
      "and made her way, with her handmaids, to the very furthest\n",
      "storeroom, where were laid up her lord’s rich treasures:\n",
      "items of bronze and gold and carefully worked iron.\n",
      "10\n",
      "There too was stored his back-bent bow and the quiver\n",
      "that held the arrows, and many the hurtful shafts packed in it,\n",
      "gifts that a guest-friend gave him when they met in in Lakedaimōn—\n",
      "Iphitos, Eurytos’ son, in appearance like the immortals:\n",
      "the two had encountered one another in Messēnē\n",
      "15\n",
      "at the house of skillful Ortilochos. In fact Odysseus\n",
      "was after a public debt then owed by the people:\n",
      "for the men of Messēnē2 had come in their many-oared ships\n",
      "and lifted three hundred sheep from Ithákē, with their shepherds.\n",
      "It was for these that Odysseus had traveled far on a mission\n",
      "20\n",
      "while still a youth, dispatched by his father and other elders.\n",
      "Iphitos too was there in search of horses he’d lost:\n",
      "a dozen brood mares, with sturdy suckling mules—\n",
      "though these afterwards brought about his destined murder,\n",
      "when he came to that stout-hearted son of Zeus, the mighty\n",
      "25\n",
      "Hēraklēs, well acquainted with violent labors, who\n",
      "killed him, guest though he was, and in his own house—\n",
      "merciless man!—regardless of the gods’ wrath and the table\n",
      "he’d set before Iphitos. The man himself he slaughtered,\n",
      "and the strong-hoofed mares he kept in his own domain.3\n",
      "30\n",
      "It was on his quest for these that Iphitos met Odysseus,\n",
      "and gave him the bow once carried by great Eurytos, who\n",
      "left it after his death to his son in his high abode;\n",
      "while Odysseus gave to Iphitos a sharp sword and a sturdy spear,\n",
      "the start of a binding guest-friendship, yet they never\n",
      "35\n",
      "knew one another at table; before that, the son of Zeus\n",
      "slew Iphitos, Eurytos’ son, in appearance like the immortals,\n",
      "who gave the bow to Odysseus. But Odysseus never\n",
      "took it with him when he went to war aboard the black ships:\n",
      "he left it to lie there at home, a memento of a good friend.\n",
      "40\n",
      "He only ever carried it while still in his own country.\n",
      "When Penelopē, bright among women, reached the storeroom,\n",
      "and stepped up to the oaken threshold—which a carpenter once\n",
      "had expertly planed and fitted true to the level,\n",
      "and set up the doorposts on it, and the shining doors on them—\n",
      "45\n",
      "at once she briskly detached the thong from its hook,\n",
      "and thrust in the key, and shot back the bolts from the doors\n",
      "with a sure aim: they groaned loudly, the noise a bull makes\n",
      "as it grazes in pasture: so groaned the beautiful doors,\n",
      "attacked by the key, and swiftly flew open for her.4\n",
      "50\n",
      "She made for a high platform, where stood various chests\n",
      "in which fragrant garments were stored. There, reaching up\n",
      "on tiptoe, she grasped and removed from its peg the bow\n",
      "together with the bright bow-case in which it was held.\n",
      "This done, she sat down, with the case placed across her knees,\n",
      "55\n",
      "and burst into loud sobs as she took out her husband’s bow.\n",
      "Then, when she’d had her fill of tearful lamentation,\n",
      "she made her way to the hall, where the haughty suitors were,\n",
      "carrying in her hands the back-bent bow, with the quiver\n",
      "that held the arrows, and many a hurtful shaft within it.\n",
      "60\n",
      "Serving women came with her, bearing a chest in which\n",
      "much iron and bronze lay stored, her husband’s prizes.\n",
      "When she, bright among women, came where the suitors were,\n",
      "she stood by the central post of the snugly timbered roof,\n",
      "holding up her shining veil in front of her face\n",
      "65\n",
      "and flanked on either side by a devoted handmaid,\n",
      "and at once she addressed the suitors, saying: “Hear me,\n",
      "you overbold suitors, you who’ve been using this house\n",
      "as a base for feasting and drinking—continually, endlessly—\n",
      "while its master’s been so long absent; nor could you think up\n",
      "70\n",
      "any other excuse to offer in support of your presence\n",
      "except your urge to wed me, make me your wife!—now come,\n",
      "since here, plain as day, is a contest for all you suitors\n",
      "that I’ll set before you: the great bow of godlike Odysseus!\n",
      "Whoever, handling this bow, shall string it most easily,\n",
      "75\n",
      "and then shoot an arrow clear through all twelve axes,5\n",
      "with him I’ll depart, leaving this house I first came to\n",
      "as a wedded wife—a fine home, and full of rich possessions!\n",
      "I think I shall always remember it, even in my dreams.”\n",
      "So she spoke, and then ordered Eumaios, the noble swineherd,\n",
      "80\n",
      "to set up for the suitors the bow and the grey iron.\n",
      "Weeping, Eumaios took and arranged them: the cowherd too\n",
      "burst into tears at the sight of his master’s bow. But now\n",
      "Antinoös spoke in reproof, and addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Stupid yokels, only concerned with things of the day!\n",
      "85\n",
      "Why, wretched pair, are you blubbering? It only agitates\n",
      "the heart in your mistress’ breast! And that heart, as it is,\n",
      "lies grief-stricken, since she’s lost her beloved bedfellow!\n",
      "Either sit here and feast in silence, or, if cry you must,\n",
      "go and do it outside. But the bow you must leave back here,\n",
      "90\n",
      "a decisive test for the suitors, for I don’t imagine\n",
      "this polished bow will prove an easy one to be strung:\n",
      "among all this crowd here there’s not a single man\n",
      "such as Odysseus was—for I saw him myself,\n",
      "and remember him well, though then I was only a child.”\n",
      "95\n",
      "So he spoke; but the heart in his breast still hoped that he himself\n",
      "would string the bow, shoot a shaft clear through the iron.\n",
      "In fact, he would be the first to sample an arrow shot\n",
      "by that same peerless Odysseus, whom, as he sat in the hall,\n",
      "he was now insulting, and urging his comrades to do likewise.\n",
      "100\n",
      "Then Tēlemachos, princely in power, addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Surely Kronos’ son Zeus must have rendered me witless!\n",
      "My own\n",
      "dear mother, sensible though she is, declares\n",
      "she’ll abandon this house and go with another husband—\n",
      "and yet I, in my witless mind, laugh and enjoy the fun!\n",
      "105\n",
      "But come now, you suitors, since here’s the prize before you:\n",
      "a lady the like of whom there’s none now in all Achaia,\n",
      "or sacred Pylos, or Argos, or Mykēnai, or even Ithákē\n",
      "itself, or on the dark mainland. But you yourselves\n",
      "know all this: what need for me to praise my mother?\n",
      "110\n",
      "So, don’t sidetrack the matter in hand with excuses, stop\n",
      "putting off the bow’s stringing: let’s get to see it now!\n",
      "Indeed, I myself might make trial of the bow—and if\n",
      "I should string it, and shoot an arrow through the iron,\n",
      "I shan’t have to worry about my lady mother leaving\n",
      "115\n",
      "this house with another man: I shall still be here, one now\n",
      "well able to win my own father’s splendid contests.”\n",
      "With that he stripped off the scarlet cloak from his shoulders,\n",
      "unslung his sharp sword, and sprang to his feet. He then\n",
      "first of all set up the axes. He dug a trench, a single\n",
      "120\n",
      "long trench for them all, cut true to a line, and tamped\n",
      "the earth down round them. All watching him were amazed\n",
      "that he set them up right, having never seen them before.\n",
      "This done, he went to the threshold, to make trial of the bow.\n",
      "Three times he made it quiver in his effort to bend it;\n",
      "125\n",
      "three times he gave up, though privately he still hoped\n",
      "to string the bow and to shoot an arrow through the iron.\n",
      "At his fourth attempt, indeed, he’d have drawn and strung it,\n",
      "so determined he was; but Odysseus shook his head,6 and stopped him.\n",
      "Tēlemachos, princely in power, again addressed them, saying:\n",
      "130\n",
      "“Oh damn it, even in time to come I’ll be mean and feeble,\n",
      "or else I’m too young still, can’t rely on the strength of my hands\n",
      "to defend me against some man who starts a quarrel!\n",
      "So come now, all you whose strength is greater than mine,\n",
      "make trial of the bow, and let’s wind up this contest.”\n",
      "135\n",
      "So he spoke and grounded the bow, left it standing against\n",
      "the close-fitting, well-polished door panels; and there too\n",
      "he propped a swift arrow against the elegant door hook.\n",
      "Then he sat down again on the fine chair from which he’d risen.\n",
      "Antinoös now addressed them, the son of Eupeithēs, saying:\n",
      "140\n",
      "“All of you up in order, my comrades, from left to right,\n",
      "beginning from where the cupbearer pours the wine.”\n",
      "So spoke Antinoös, and what he said found approval.\n",
      "The first to stand up was Leiōdēs, son of Oinōps,7\n",
      "their diviner, who always sat at the back of the hall\n",
      "145\n",
      "by the beautiful mixing bowl: to him alone their reckless\n",
      "conduct was hateful. He disapproved of all the suitors.\n",
      "He now was the first to take the bow and swift arrow:\n",
      "he went and stood at the threshold, made trial of the bow,\n",
      "but failed to bend it. His hands—tender, unhardened—\n",
      "150\n",
      "too soon wearied of pulling. He addressed the suitors, saying:\n",
      "“Friends, I’m unable to bend it—let another man now try!\n",
      "Many the lordly men this bow is going to deprive\n",
      "of spirit and life, since indeed it’s far preferable to die\n",
      "than live on after failing at that in pursuit of which\n",
      "155\n",
      "we continue assembling here, in daily expectation!\n",
      "At present a man can still not only want but hope\n",
      "to marry Penelopē, the bedfellow of Odysseus;\n",
      "but when he’s made trial of the bow, and seen the result,\n",
      "then let him court with his gifts some other finely costumed\n",
      "160\n",
      "Achaian woman, and let Penelopē marry whoever\n",
      "makes her the best offer, and comes as her fated spouse.”\n",
      "So he spoke and grounded the bow, left it standing against\n",
      "the close-fitting, polished door panels; and there too\n",
      "he propped a swift arrow, against the elegant door hook.\n",
      "165\n",
      "Then he sat down again on the fine chair from which he’d risen.\n",
      "But Antinoös spoke in reproof, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Leiōdēs,\n",
      "what’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth,\n",
      "so fearful and grievous an utterance? To hear it enrages me!\n",
      "if it’s true that this bow will deprive many lordly men\n",
      "170\n",
      "of spirit and life, because you yourself can’t bend it,\n",
      "even so, though your lady mother didn’t bear you to be\n",
      "strong enough to string bows or shoot arrows, nevertheless\n",
      "other proud suitors there are who’ll bend it soon enough!”\n",
      "So he spoke, and gave orders to Melanthios the goatherd:\n",
      "175\n",
      "“To work, Melanthios! Get the fire going here in the hall,\n",
      "and beside it put a large chair with a fleece spread on it,\n",
      "and fetch out the big wheel of tallow you’ll find inside,\n",
      "so that we youths may warm the bow, and grease it with fat,\n",
      "and so get to make trial of it, and conclude this contest.”\n",
      "180\n",
      "So he spoke. Melanthios rekindled the unwearying fire,\n",
      "fetched, and set close by, a chair with a fleece spread on it,\n",
      "then brought out the large wheel of tallow he found inside.\n",
      "With this the youths warmed the bow, then tried it, but still\n",
      "failed to bend it. They had nothing near the needed strength.\n",
      "185\n",
      "But Antinoös still held back, as did godlike Eurymachos:\n",
      "they were the leading suitors, and far the best in prowess.\n",
      "Two men now left the hall, going out together,\n",
      "the cowherd and swineherd of godlike Odysseus; and he,\n",
      "noble Odysseus himself, went close behind them.\n",
      "190\n",
      "But when they were all outside the gates and the courtyard,\n",
      "then he spoke, and addressed them in friendly manner, saying:\n",
      "“Cowherd, and you too, swineherd, shall I tell you something\n",
      "or keep it to myself? Oh, my heart impels me to speak!\n",
      "How would you feel about supporting Odysseus, were he\n",
      "195\n",
      "suddenly to appear from somewhere, brought by some god?\n",
      "Would you be on the side of the suitors, or of Odysseus?\n",
      "Tell me whatever your heart and spirit dictate!”\n",
      "In answer\n",
      "the herdsman who cared for the cattle responded, saying:\n",
      "“Zeus, Father, would that you might fulfill this wish! Now grant\n",
      "200\n",
      "that man his return, and a god to escort him! Then\n",
      "you’d learn what strength I have, and how my hands employ it!”\n",
      "Eumaios in the same way likewise prayed to all the gods\n",
      "that quick-witted Odysseus might return to his own home.\n",
      "So when he’d found out for certain how these two were minded,\n",
      "205\n",
      "Odysseus once more responded, and addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Back home now indeed I am! After suffering much hardship\n",
      "I’ve returned, in the twentieth year, to my native country!\n",
      "I know that to both of you, alone of all my servants,\n",
      "my arrival is truly welcome: of the rest I’ve not heard one\n",
      "210\n",
      "pray that I might return, make it back to my home!\n",
      "So to you two I’ll speak the truth, how it’s going to be:\n",
      "if a god grants me victory over these haughty suitors,\n",
      "I’ll find wives for you both, and give you possessions,\n",
      "and houses built close to my own; and for me thereafter\n",
      "215\n",
      "you’ll be Tēlemachos’ comrades, indeed his brethren!\n",
      "And look, I’ll show you another manifest sign\n",
      "by which you may know me for sure and trust what I say—\n",
      "the scar of the wound that I got from a boar’s white tusk\n",
      "long ago, when I went up Parnassos with Autolykos’ sons.”\n",
      "220\n",
      "So saying, he pulled back his rags from over the great scar.\n",
      "When the two had examined it carefully, in detail,\n",
      "weeping they flung their arms about skillful Odysseus\n",
      "and kissed his head and his shoulders in loving welcome,\n",
      "while Odysseus likewise was kissing their heads and hands.\n",
      "225\n",
      "And now the sun would have gone down on their tears\n",
      "had not Odysseus himself put a stop to it, saying: “Quit\n",
      "your weeping and wailing! Somebody coming out here\n",
      "from the hall might see us and report back to those inside.\n",
      "Now, you two go on in, but separately, not together—\n",
      "230\n",
      "I’ll go first, you after me. And let’s have this as a signal:\n",
      "all the others, the whole crowd of these haughty suitors,\n",
      "won’t agree to me being given the bow and the quiver;\n",
      "but you, noble Eumaios, as you go through the house\n",
      "with the bow, put it into my hands—and order the women\n",
      "235\n",
      "to bar the close-fitting doors at the entrance to their quarters;\n",
      "and if any of them hear groans, or the thud of falling\n",
      "men within our walls, they’re not to go out, but remain\n",
      "just where they are, keep silent, and go on with their work.\n",
      "And to you, noble Philoitios, I entrust the task of bolting\n",
      "240\n",
      "the courtyard gates, and quickly roping them shut as well.”\n",
      "So saying, he made his way into the pleasantly sited house,\n",
      "and went and sat down on the chair from which he’d risen;\n",
      "godlike Odysseus’ two servants then followed him inside.\n",
      "Eurymachos was now turning the bow about in his hands,\n",
      "245\n",
      "warming it, this side and that, in the fire’s glow; yet not even\n",
      "thus could he bend it: his lordly heart was sore vexed,\n",
      "and, deeply troubled, he now addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Alas, here’s distress for myself and for all of you too!\n",
      "It’s not this lost marriage that I lament so much,\n",
      "250\n",
      "grieved though I am; there are many Achaian ladies,\n",
      "some here on sea-girt Ithákē, and more in other cities.\n",
      "But if we’re so far lacking in strength compared\n",
      "to godlike Odysseus that we can’t even bend and string\n",
      "his bow—that’s a disgrace that men yet unborn will hear of.”\n",
      "255\n",
      "Antinoös, son of Eupeithēs, then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“It will not be so, Eurymachos, as you know very well!\n",
      "Throughout the region this is the god’s solemn feast day—\n",
      "who’d be bending a bow now? Today we’ll take things easy,\n",
      "so put that aside! And why don’t we leave all the axes standing\n",
      "260\n",
      "where they are? No one, I think, is going to come here, to the hall\n",
      "of Odysseus, Laërtēs’ son, and remove them! So for now\n",
      "let the wine steward pour the initial drops in our cups\n",
      "so we can offer libations, and lay the curved bow aside;\n",
      "then early tomorrow morning tell the goatherd Melanthios\n",
      "265\n",
      "to bring the very best she-goats in all the herds, so we\n",
      "may offer thigh-pieces to Apollo the famous archer,\n",
      "and then make trial of the bow and conclude the contest.”\n",
      "So spoke Antinoös, and what he said found approval.\n",
      "Now the heralds poured water over their hands, and youths\n",
      "270\n",
      "filled up the mixing-bowls with drink, poured drops\n",
      "into the cups for libation, then served wine to all.\n",
      "After they’d offered libations and drunk all they’d a mind to,\n",
      "resourceful Odysseus addressed them, with deception in mind:\n",
      "“Listen to me, you suitors of the illustrious queen,\n",
      "275\n",
      "to what the heart in my breast now urges me to tell you!\n",
      "To Eurymachos most of all, and to godlike Antinoös\n",
      "I appeal, since the latter got it right when he said\n",
      "that for now you should put the bow by, let the gods decide—\n",
      "In the morning the god will confer the power where he wishes!\n",
      "280\n",
      "But come, give the polished bow to me, that here among you\n",
      "I may try out my hands and strength, see whether the force\n",
      "is still there, as when my limbs were supple, or whether\n",
      "by now lack of care and vagrancy have destroyed it.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and they all expressed high indignation,\n",
      "285\n",
      "afraid as they were that he might string the polished bow.\n",
      "So Antinoös spoke in reproof, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Ah, wretched stranger, devoid of even the slightest sense!\n",
      "Is it not enough for you that you dine at ease among us,\n",
      "your betters, that you’re barred from none of the feast, sit in\n",
      "290\n",
      "on all our conversation, when there’s no other stranger\n",
      "or beggar who gets to listen to everything we say?\n",
      "It’s the wine, the honey-sweet wine, that damages you, just as\n",
      "it harms anyone who swills it, who drinks to excess! It was wine\n",
      "that infatuated the Centaur, far-famed Eurytiōn,\n",
      "295\n",
      "in the hall of great-hearted Peirithoös, when he went\n",
      "to visit the Lapiths: there, wits fuddled with wine,\n",
      "in his madness he wrought evil in Peirithoös’ house.8\n",
      "Outraged, the heroes sprang on him, dragged him outside\n",
      "through the forecourt, cut off his ears and nose\n",
      "300\n",
      "with the pitiless bronze; and he, now stupefied in mind,\n",
      "went about with his unstable spirit bearing that fatal burden.\n",
      "Hence sprang the feud between the Centaurs and mankind;\n",
      "but he first for himself met trouble, when heavy with wine.\n",
      "And for you I foresee great misery should you indeed\n",
      "305\n",
      "bend and string this bow: you’ll find no courtesy here\n",
      "in our district—we’ll send you straight off in a black ship\n",
      "to King Echetos, maimer of all mortal men alive,9\n",
      "from whom you would have no escape. So now sit quiet,\n",
      "drink your wine, don’t contend with men younger than yourself.”\n",
      "310\n",
      "Prudent Penelopē responded to him, saying: “It’s neither\n",
      "decent nor just, Antinoös, to deprive Tēlemachos’ guests\n",
      "—whoever may come to the house here—of their proper due!\n",
      "Do you expect, if this stranger, trusting his hands and strength,\n",
      "strings the great bow of Odysseus, that he’ll then take me\n",
      "315\n",
      "off to his home, and make me his bedfellow? I’m sure\n",
      "that he himself now nurses no such expectation!\n",
      "So none of you need to worry on that account, or let it\n",
      "spoil your appetite here: that indeed would be unseemly.”\n",
      "Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "320\n",
      "“Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelopē, we don’t think\n",
      "this man will make off with you—yes, that would be unseemly!—\n",
      "but the gossip of men and women could embarrass us: some low\n",
      "Achaian lout may well later start saying this kind of thing:\n",
      "‘Oh yes, far weaker men now are courting the bedfellow\n",
      "325\n",
      "of a faultless man—they can’t even string his polished bow!\n",
      "But some other fellow, a vagrant beggar, who turned up here\n",
      "strung the bow easily, and shot clear through the iron.’\n",
      "So men will talk, and this would be a reproach to us all.”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē once more responded to him, saying:\n",
      "330\n",
      "“Eurymachos, no way can good report spread in public\n",
      "about those who devour, and so dishonor, a nobleman’s\n",
      "household goods! Why make this, then, a matter for reproach?\n",
      "The stranger’s a very big fellow, and strongly built; he also\n",
      "claims he’s the son of a father of excellent ancestry.\n",
      "335\n",
      "So give him the polished bow now, and let’s see what happens!\n",
      "For this I’ll declare to you, and it shall come to pass:\n",
      "if he does string the bow, and Apollo lets him triumph,\n",
      "I’ll dress him in cloak and tunic, fine quality garments,\n",
      "and give him a sharpened javelin, to ward off dogs and men,\n",
      "340\n",
      "and a double-edged sword, and sandals to strap on under\n",
      "his feet, and send him wherever his heart and spirit dictate.”\n",
      "Then sagacious Tēlemachos responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“There’s not one Achaian, my mother, more entitled than myself\n",
      "to give, or refuse, this bow to whomsoever I please—\n",
      "345\n",
      "not any of those who hold power here on rugged Ithákē,\n",
      "or lord it over the islands toward horse-pasturing Ēlis!\n",
      "Of these none will thwart my will, even if I choose to make\n",
      "an outright gift of the bow, for this stranger to carry off!\n",
      "Into the house with you now, attend to your own tasks—\n",
      "350\n",
      "the loom and the distaff! And give orders to your handmaids\n",
      "to stick to their proper work! The bow shall be men’s business—\n",
      "all men’s, but mine above all: in this house I hold the power.”\n",
      "Astonished, Penelopē went back into the house,\n",
      "and took to heart her son’s sagacious remarks.\n",
      "355\n",
      "she climbed to her upper chamber with her handmaids,\n",
      "and there she wept for Odysseus, her dear husband, until\n",
      "grey-eyed Athēnē shed sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\n",
      "The noble swineherd now picked up the curved bow,\n",
      "and was bearing it off; but the suitors all clamored in the hall,\n",
      "360\n",
      "and thus would one of the arrogant younger men exclaim:\n",
      "“Where, wretched swineherd, are you taking that curved bow?\n",
      "Are you crazy? The hunting dogs you bred yourself will soon\n",
      "wolf you down, all alone among your pigs, if Apollo\n",
      "looks kindly upon us—he, and the other immortal gods.”\n",
      "365\n",
      "So they spoke. Right there he dropped the bow where he stood,\n",
      "terrified: they were so many, the noise in the hall so loud.\n",
      "But Tēlemachos shouted threateningly from the other side:\n",
      "“Old fellow, keep on with the bow! Obey them, and you’ll be sorry!\n",
      "Though I’m younger than you I’ll chase you out to the fields\n",
      "370\n",
      "with a shower of stones! At least I’m stronger than you!\n",
      "I only wish I was tougher, and a better man with my fists,\n",
      "than all the suitors arrayed here in these halls: then I’d\n",
      "soon send some of them packing from our house\n",
      "in a dire state, because of the trouble they make here.”\n",
      "375\n",
      "So he spoke, but the suitors all laughed cheerfully at him,\n",
      "forgetting the bitter resentment that they’d long nursed\n",
      "against Tēlemachos. The swineherd carried the bow\n",
      "through the hall to skillful Odysseus, placed it in his hands,\n",
      "then summoned the nurse Eurykleia, and addressed her, saying:\n",
      "380\n",
      "“Orders for you from Tēlemachos, prudent Eurykleia:\n",
      "you’re to bar the close-fitted doors at the entrance to your quarters,\n",
      "and if any of you hear groans or the thud of falling\n",
      "men here within our walls, they’re not to go out, but remain\n",
      "just where they are, keep silent, and go on with their work.”\n",
      "385\n",
      "So he spoke; but her answer remained unwinged. She went\n",
      "and barred the doors of their pleasantly sited quarters,\n",
      "while Philoitios said nothing, but hurried out of the house,\n",
      "and barred the gates to the well-walled courtyard. Down\n",
      "in the colonnade there lay coiled a shapely vessel’s\n",
      "390\n",
      "fiber cable: with this he secured the gates, and himself\n",
      "went back in, sat down on the chair from which he’d risen,\n",
      "and watched Odysseus, who was already handling the bow,\n",
      "kept turning it round, made trial of it this way and that,\n",
      "to see if worms had eaten the horn in its master’s absence;\n",
      "395\n",
      "and thus would an onlooker speak, with a glance at his neighbor:\n",
      "“He must be a connoisseur, some kind of expert in bows!\n",
      "Either he himself has such fine bows stored back home,\n",
      "or else he intends to make one, the way he turns it about\n",
      "this way and that—evildoer and vagrant that he is!”\n",
      "400\n",
      "And another of these haughty youths would speak up, saying:\n",
      "“I wish just as much good fortune for this old fellow\n",
      "as he’s likely to get in the contest for stringing the bow.”\n",
      "Such was the talk of the suitors. But resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "as soon as he’d got his great bow and viewed it all over—\n",
      "405\n",
      "just as a man, a professional lyre player and singer,\n",
      "will easily stretch the string around a new peg, secure\n",
      "the twisted sheep gut at either end, so now\n",
      "Odysseus without hard effort strung the great bow,\n",
      "and took it in his right hand, and tested the string,\n",
      "410\n",
      "which sang good and high at his touch, like a swallow’s voice.\n",
      "The suitors were much distressed. The faces of them all\n",
      "changed color. Zeus thundered loudly, making plain his signs,\n",
      "and much-enduring noble Odysseus now rejoiced\n",
      "that sly-counselling Kronos’ son had sent him an omen.\n",
      "415\n",
      "He picked up the swift shaft that lay there on the table,\n",
      "ready (the rest were still stored in their hollow quiver—\n",
      "those arrows that the Achaians were soon to experience),\n",
      "set it on the bow’s hand grip, then—still seated\n",
      "there in his chair—drew the string with the notched arrow,\n",
      "420\n",
      "took careful aim, and let fly. He did not miss one helve base\n",
      "of all the axes: clean through and out at the end\n",
      "flew his bronze-heavy shaft. He addressed Tēlemachos, saying:\n",
      "“The stranger that sits in your hall, Tēlemachos, does you no\n",
      "discredit: I neither missed the mark, nor spent\n",
      "425\n",
      "much labor on stringing the bow. My strength is still there—\n",
      "not gone, as these suitors insult me by claiming so mockingly!\n",
      "But now it’s time to get dinner ready for the Achaians—\n",
      "in daylight. And after that there’s other entertainment,\n",
      "songs and the lyre, the accompaniment to feasting.”\n",
      "430\n",
      "Then godlike Odysseus signaled them with his eyebrows,\n",
      "and his dear son Tēlemachos strapped on his keen-edged sword,10\n",
      "and put out a hand to the spear, tipped with gleaming bronze,\n",
      "that was standing close to him, propped up beside his chair.\n",
      "Book 22\n",
      "Now resourceful Odysseus stripped himself of his rags\n",
      "and sprang up on the great threshold, taking the bow\n",
      "and the shaft-packed quiver. He poured out the swift arrows\n",
      "there at his feet, and addressed the suitors, saying:\n",
      "“This contest’s over, decisively ended; and now\n",
      "5\n",
      "I’ll go for another target, reached by no man hitherto,\n",
      "to see whether I can hit it, and Apollo grant me glory.”\n",
      "He spoke, and then aimed a bitter shaft at Antinoös,\n",
      "who was on the point of raising an elegant cup to his lips—\n",
      "golden, twin-eared—had it in his hands, was intending\n",
      "10\n",
      "to drink wine from it: in his mind was no thought of death.\n",
      "For who amid fellow feasters would ever imagine\n",
      "that one man, however strong, alone against many,\n",
      "would contrive for him a bad death and black fate? But Odysseus\n",
      "took aim and struck him in the throat with his arrow,\n",
      "15\n",
      "and clear through the tender neck the point was driven,\n",
      "and he slumped to one side, the cup dropped from his hand\n",
      "when he was hit, and up through his nostrils at once\n",
      "came a thick spurt of human blood; a kick of his foot\n",
      "sent the table flying, scattered all the food on the floor,\n",
      "20\n",
      "bread and roast meat in the dirt together. The suitors\n",
      "made an uproar throughout the hall when they saw the man\n",
      "fallen: sprang from their seats, panic-stricken, in the hall,\n",
      "looking all round at the solid walls, but nowhere\n",
      "was there a shield or strong spear that they could grab.\n",
      "25\n",
      "So they abused Odysseus in furious words, declaring:\n",
      "“It’s an outrage, stranger, for you to shoot men! You’ll never\n",
      "compete in another contest! Now you’ve sealed your fate!\n",
      "The man you killed was by far the noblest of the youths\n",
      "on Ithákē: because of that the vultures shall eat you here.”\n",
      "30\n",
      "So said each of them, for indeed they supposed he’d not\n",
      "killed the man on purpose: poor fools, they had no notion\n",
      "that over them all the bonds of destruction were set.\n",
      "Then, with an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus replied:\n",
      "“You dogs, you thought that I’d never come home again\n",
      "35\n",
      "from the Trojans’ land, the way you ravaged my house,\n",
      "and forcibly bedded my women servants, and while\n",
      "I was still alive, underhandedly courted my wife,\n",
      "with no fear of the gods who own broad heaven,\n",
      "or of any human reproof that might come hereafter!\n",
      "40\n",
      "Now over you all the bonds of destruction are set!”\n",
      "So he spoke. Pale dread possessed them all: each man\n",
      "looked round for a way to escape from sheer destruction.\n",
      "Only Eurymachos now responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“If you indeed are Odysseus, come home to Ithákē, then\n",
      "45\n",
      "what you say about all the Achaians have done is just—\n",
      "many their wanton acts, here in the house, out afield!\n",
      "But the man lies dead who was to blame for it all—\n",
      "Antinoös! He it was who instigated these deeds,\n",
      "not so much out of desire or need for the marriage,\n",
      "50\n",
      "but with a different aim, not fulfilled by Kronos’ son:\n",
      "that over well-ordered Ithákē he might himself\n",
      "be king—and lie in wait for your son and kill him!\n",
      "Now he’s been fairly slain, spare these people: they are\n",
      "your own! And hereafter we’ll collect you reparation\n",
      "55\n",
      "for all that’s been drunk or eaten here in this hall,\n",
      "each man providing you with the worth of twenty oxen!\n",
      "We’ll requite you in bronze and gold until your heart is softened;\n",
      "but until that time comes no man could blame you for your anger.”\n",
      "Then. with an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded:\n",
      "60\n",
      "“Eurymachos, were you to give me all you had from your fathers,\n",
      "all that you now possess, plus what you could find elsewhere,\n",
      "not even so would I stay my hands from slaughter\n",
      "until the suitors had paid the full price for their wrongdoing!\n",
      "Now it’s your choice whether you’ll stand and fight me\n",
      "65\n",
      "or run—if anyone here can dodge death and its spirits;\n",
      "but none of you, I think, will escape from sheer destruction.”\n",
      "So he spoke: there and then their knees and hearts gave way.\n",
      "But Eurymachos now spoke again, and addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Friends, this man won’t restrain his invincible hands!\n",
      "70\n",
      "Now he’s got control of the polished bow and its quiver\n",
      "he’ll shoot from the smooth-worn threshold until he’s killed\n",
      "every last one of us! We must think about how to fight him!\n",
      "So draw your swords now, hold the tables in front of you\n",
      "against his swift deadly arrows, and then let’s all go for him\n",
      "75\n",
      "in a body, try to shift him from the threshold and doorway,\n",
      "then get to the city, raise a quick hue and cry. Do that,\n",
      "and this fellow will soon have shot his last shaft.”\n",
      "So saying,\n",
      "he now unsheathed his sharp sword, fashioned of bronze,\n",
      "with its double edge, and made for Odysseus, yelling out\n",
      "80\n",
      "his fearsome war cry. At the same instant noble Odysseus\n",
      "let fly another arrow. The swift shaft struck his breast\n",
      "under the nipple, drove into his liver. He dropped his sword\n",
      "on the ground, and fell, doubled up and sprawling, over\n",
      "the table: the food all went flying to the ground, along with\n",
      "85\n",
      "his two-handled cup. His forehead smashed agonizingly\n",
      "into the ground; both feet kicked out at his chair,\n",
      "dislodging it. A mist closed down over his eyes.\n",
      "Amphinomos next attacked renowned Odysseus, charging\n",
      "straight at him, keen-edged sword ready and drawn, to see\n",
      "90\n",
      "if he could force him back from the doorway. Tēlemachos\n",
      "was too quick, aimed from behind with his bronze-tipped spear,\n",
      "and hit him between the shoulders, drove right through\n",
      "his breast. He fell with a thud, hit the ground forehead first.\n",
      "But Tēlemachos sprang back, left his far-shadowing spear\n",
      "95\n",
      "there in Amphinomos, much afraid that some Achaian—\n",
      "while he was busy prising that long spear loose—might rush up\n",
      "and give him a sword thrust, catch him still stooping. So he\n",
      "set off at a run, quickly reached his dear father, stood close\n",
      "and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Father,\n",
      "100\n",
      "I’ll go now and fetch you a shield and a couple of spears,\n",
      "and an all-bronze helmet, close-fitting at the temples.\n",
      "I’ll arm myself too while I’m gone, and get arms for the swineherd\n",
      "and the cowherd too: for sure, to be in armor is better.”\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "105\n",
      "“Run, fetch them, while I still have arrows for my defense,\n",
      "lest they force me away from the doors, all alone as I am.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and Tēlemachos, in obedience to his father,\n",
      "made his way to the storeroom where their fine arms were kept,\n",
      "and from there collected four shields, eight spears, and four\n",
      "110\n",
      "bronze-plated helmets, decked with thick crests of horsehair.\n",
      "Carrying these, he quickly returned to his dear father.\n",
      "Then, first, he armored his own body in bronze,\n",
      "and the two servants likewise put on their splendid gear,\n",
      "and stood there flanking clever, subtle-minded Odysseus.\n",
      "115\n",
      "He, while he still had arrows for his defense, went after\n",
      "the suitors, one by one, never stopping, there in his house,\n",
      "aiming, then shooting. They kept falling, thick and fast.\n",
      "But when the master had no more arrows to shoot,\n",
      "the bow he propped up against the pleasantly sited hall’s\n",
      "120\n",
      "doorpost, to stand by the bright inner walls. He now\n",
      "slung from his shoulders a fourfold shield, and on\n",
      "his powerful head next settled a well-made helmet\n",
      "with a horsehair plume nodding fearsomely up above,\n",
      "and took two sturdy spears, both tipped with bronze.\n",
      "125\n",
      "There existed a side postern set in the solid wall,\n",
      "flush with the top of the pleasantly sited hall’s threshold,\n",
      "that led into a corridor and had a close-fitting door.1\n",
      "On this corridor Odysseus ordered the noble swineherd\n",
      "to keep a close watch (one man only could rush it at a time),\n",
      "130\n",
      "since Agelaös had called out to all the suitors, saying:\n",
      "“Friends, won’t one of you now slip out by that side postern,\n",
      "get word to the people, raise a quick hue and cry? Do that,\n",
      "and this fellow will soon have taken his last shot.”\n",
      "Then Melanthios, herder of goats, responded to him, saying:\n",
      "135\n",
      "“That won’t work, Agelaös, Zeus’ nursling: the fine courtyard\n",
      "doors are dangerously close, and the corridor is narrow:\n",
      "one man, if a good fighter, could hold off all comers. So let me\n",
      "go fetch armor for us to put on, from his private storeroom;\n",
      "for that, I’m certain, and no place else, is where\n",
      "140\n",
      "Odysseus and his illustrious son have stowed their gear.”\n",
      "So saying, Melanthios, herder of goats, went up\n",
      "by the steps of the hall to the storerooms of Odysseus.2\n",
      "From there he took twelve shields, and a dozen spears,\n",
      "and as many bronze helmets with thick horsehair crests,\n",
      "145\n",
      "and made his way back, and quickly gave them to the suitors.\n",
      "Then Odysseus’ knees and courage both wilted as he saw them\n",
      "girding themselves in armor and brandishing long spears\n",
      "in their hands, and huge his task now appeared to him,\n",
      "and at once he addressed Tēlemachos with winged words, saying:\n",
      "150\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, it must be one of the women in the halls\n",
      "is backing this bad fight against us—or maybe Melanthios.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“I myself, father, made the mistake here—no one else\n",
      "is to blame! It was I who left the close-fitting door\n",
      "155\n",
      "of the storeroom ajar: they kept a sharper watch than I did!\n",
      "You go now, noble Eumaios, and shut that storeroom door,\n",
      "and see if it’s one of the women who’s behind this, or,\n",
      "as I suspect, Melanthios, Dolios’ son.”\n",
      "Such was\n",
      "the conversation between them, one to the other.\n",
      "160\n",
      "But Melanthios, herder of goats, went back to the storeroom\n",
      "to fetch more fine armor. The noble swineherd saw him,\n",
      "and at once addressed Odysseus, close by him, saying:\n",
      "“Scion of Zeus, Laërtēs’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\n",
      "there’s that dangerous busybody—the one we ourselves\n",
      "165\n",
      "suspect—off back to the storeroom! So tell me truthfully,\n",
      "am I to kill the man, if I prove the better fighter,\n",
      "or bring him here to you, to pay for the misdemeanors,\n",
      "all of them, that he’s committed here in your house?”\n",
      "To him\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying: “For sure,\n",
      "170\n",
      "I and Tēlemachos will hold off these haughty suitors,\n",
      "keep them shut in the hall here, however hard they struggle!\n",
      "You two should force both that man’s hands and feet\n",
      "behind his back, lash them to boards there, dump him\n",
      "into the storeroom, attach a braided rope to his body,\n",
      "175\n",
      "hoist him up the tall column until he’s near the roof beams:\n",
      "that way he’ll stay alive longest and suffer real agony.”\n",
      "So he spoke. They listened carefully and obeyed him.\n",
      "To the storeroom they went, unnoticed by the man inside,\n",
      "who was searching for armor far in the back. The two\n",
      "180\n",
      "lay in wait for him, standing on either side of the doorway.\n",
      "When Melanthios, herder of goats, was crossing the threshold—\n",
      "in one hand a splendid helmet, and in the other\n",
      "an old broad shield, that was all befouled with mildew\n",
      "and belonged to the hero Laërtēs, who’d carried it when young,\n",
      "185\n",
      "but it had long been laid up, the seams of its straps were rotted—\n",
      "the two sprang, seized him, dragged him in by his hair,\n",
      "flung him down, sore anguished at heart, on the ground.\n",
      "They lashed his hands and feet tight with agonizing bonds,\n",
      "forcing them right behind his back, exactly the way\n",
      "190\n",
      "that Laërtēs’ son, much-enduring noble Odysseus\n",
      "had told them to do. They attached a braided rope to his body,\n",
      "and hauled him up the tall column until he was near the roof beams.\n",
      "Then, swineherd Eumaios, you made mock of him, saying:\n",
      "“This way, Melanthios, you’ll keep watch the whole night,\n",
      "195\n",
      "lying there on the kind of soft bed that’s proper for you;\n",
      "nor shall Dawn, early risen, coming up from Ocean’s streams\n",
      "in gold-throned splendor escape your notice as you\n",
      "bring the suitors your she-goats to set up a feast in the hall.”\n",
      "So he was left there, stretched tight in his deadly bonds,\n",
      "200\n",
      "while the two put on their armor, closed the bright door,\n",
      "and made their way back to clever, subtle-minded Odysseus.\n",
      "There they stood on the threshold, breathing courage,\n",
      "four men against a crowd of good fighters in the feast hall.\n",
      "Then Zeus’ daughter Athēnē came up close to them,\n",
      "205\n",
      "assuming the likeness of Mentōr, in both voice and person.\n",
      "Odysseus rejoiced at the sight of her, and addressed her, saying:\n",
      "“Mentōr, defend us from harm, remember your dear comrade\n",
      "who used to do you good turns: you and I are the same age.”\n",
      "So he spoke: but he guessed it was Athēnē the host-rallier.\n",
      "210\n",
      "The suitors across from him made an uproar in the hall\n",
      "and the first to rebuke Athēnē was Damastōr’s son Agelaös:\n",
      "“Mentōr, don’t let Odysseus sidetrack you with his glib talk\n",
      "into fighting against the suitors and giving aid to him!\n",
      "For this is how I think our purpose will be accomplished:\n",
      "215\n",
      "when we kill these men, both father and son, you too\n",
      "will be slain along with them, for the deeds you’re so eager\n",
      "to perform in these halls: with your own head you’ll pay for them!\n",
      "And when with the bronze we’ve stripped you of your violence,\n",
      "all the possessions you have, whether indoor or outside,\n",
      "220\n",
      "we’ll add to those of Odysseus! We won’t let your sons live\n",
      "in your halls, nor grant your daughters or your good wife\n",
      "the right to move freely about Ithákē.”\n",
      "So he spoke,\n",
      "and Athēnē grew even more furious at heart,\n",
      "and upbraided Odysseus with angry words: “No longer\n",
      "225\n",
      "is your courage steadfast, Odysseus, nor that fine prowess\n",
      "you showed when over Helen—high-born, white-armed—\n",
      "for nine years you fought the Trojans unceasingly,\n",
      "and many fighters you killed in that dread conflict—\n",
      "it was your advice brought down Priam’s broad-wayed city!\n",
      "230\n",
      "Why then now, when you’re back to home and possessions,\n",
      "do you wail at the thought of facing up to the suitors?\n",
      "So come here, my friend, stand beside me, watch me at work,\n",
      "and see the way, when up against hostile fighters,\n",
      "that Alkimos’ son Mentōr repays your good services!”\n",
      "235\n",
      "She spoke, yet still did not give him enough strength to prevail\n",
      "in his battle, was still making trial of the might and valor\n",
      "both of Odysseus himself and of his illustrious son.\n",
      "And now she flew up to a roof beam of the smoky hall\n",
      "and perched there in plain view, in the likeness of a swallow.\n",
      "240\n",
      "Agelaös, Damastōr’s son, was now urging the suitors on,\n",
      "with Eurynomos, Amphimedōn, Dēmoptolemos,\n",
      "Peisandros, Polyktōr’s son, and skillful Polybos;\n",
      "for these were by far the most valiant of the suitors\n",
      "who were still alive and fighting for their survival: the pick\n",
      "245\n",
      "of the rest had already fallen to the bow and constant arrows.3\n",
      "Agelaös then spoke among them, addressing them all: “My friends,\n",
      "this man by now must surely hold up his invincible hands!\n",
      "After all those empty boasts his friend Mentōr’s deserted him,\n",
      "and they’re left by themselves there at the outer doorway!\n",
      "250\n",
      "So don’t now throw your long spears at them all together,\n",
      "but you six throw first, see whether Zeus will maybe\n",
      "grant that Odysseus be hit, and we win the glory—\n",
      "once he’s fallen, there’s no need to worry about the others.”\n",
      "So he spoke. They all threw their spears as he suggested,\n",
      "255\n",
      "with force; but Athēnē made all their efforts unsuccessful.\n",
      "One of them hit a doorpost of the well-built feast hall,\n",
      "a second the close-fitting door itself; another’s\n",
      "bronze-weighted ash spear ended up against the wall.\n",
      "So when the suitors’ spears had missed them, much-enduring\n",
      "260\n",
      "Odysseus at once addressed them, saying: “My friends,\n",
      "this, I’d say, is the moment for us too now to hurl\n",
      "our own spears into the thick of these suitors, who are so eager\n",
      "to kill and strip us, on top of their earlier misdemeanors.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and they all now threw their keen-edged spears\n",
      "265\n",
      "with careful aim. Odysseus hit Dēmoptolemos;\n",
      "Tēlemachos, Euryadēs; the swineherd, Elatos; while\n",
      "the cowherd who cared for the cattle killed Peisandros.\n",
      "These then all together bit the wide earth with their teeth,\n",
      "and the suitors retreated to the innermost part of the hall,\n",
      "270\n",
      "while the others rushed forward and pulled their spears from the dead.\n",
      "Then once more the suitors threw their keen-edged spears\n",
      "with force,4 but Athēnē made their efforts mostly unsuccessful.\n",
      "one of them hit a doorpost of the well-built feast hall,\n",
      "a second the close-fitting door itself; another’s\n",
      "275\n",
      "bronze-weighted ash spear ended up against the wall.\n",
      "but Amphimedōn hit Tēlemachos on the arm at his wrist,\n",
      "a glancing blow, the bronze scraping the surface of the skin,\n",
      "and Ktēsippos with his long spear grazed Eumaios’ shoulder\n",
      "above his shield, but the spear flew on, ended in the ground.\n",
      "280\n",
      "Then once more those with the sharp and subtle-minded Odysseus\n",
      "flung their own keen-edged spears into the thick of the suitors,\n",
      "and once more Odysseus, city-sacker, scored a hit,\n",
      "on Eurydamas; Tēlemachos on Amphimedōn; the swineherd\n",
      "on Polybos, while the herder of cattle struck Ktēsippos\n",
      "285\n",
      "square in the breast, and boasted over him, saying:\n",
      "“Polythersēs’ son, insult-fancier, nevermore, ever, again\n",
      "thoughtlessly talk big, but leave any kind of comment\n",
      "to the gods, since they are far mightier! Here is a guest-gift\n",
      "for you, a return for that ox hoof you lately presented\n",
      "290\n",
      "to godlike Odysseus, on his begging round in the house.”\n",
      "So spoke the crumple-horned cattle’s herder; but Odysseus\n",
      "now wounded Damastōr’s son with his long spear, close up,\n",
      "and Tēlemachos wounded Leōkritos, Euēnōr’s son,\n",
      "with a spear in the nether belly, drove the bronze through:\n",
      "295\n",
      "he fell prone, hitting the ground squarely with his forehead.\n",
      "Then Athēnē held up her aegis, the destroyer of mortals,\n",
      "from on high in the roof: the suitors were terrified,\n",
      "and stampeded through the hall like a herd of cows\n",
      "that the darting gadfly descends on and drives to distraction\n",
      "300\n",
      "in the season of spring, when the days are lengthening;\n",
      "and just as vultures, with crooked talons and hooked beaks,\n",
      "come out from the mountains and swoop down on other birds,\n",
      "that fly fast over the plain, and avoid the clouds, but still\n",
      "the vultures pounce and destroy them: they have no defense\n",
      "305\n",
      "or way of escape, and men enjoy watching the hunt—\n",
      "so now did they harry the suitors throughout the hall,\n",
      "striking them right and left, and hideous cries went up\n",
      "as their heads were cracked, and the whole floor ran with blood.\n",
      "Leiōdēs rushed forward and clasped Odysseus’ knees\n",
      "310\n",
      "and with winged words entreated him, saying: “I beg you\n",
      "by your knees, Odysseus, respect me and pity me! Never,\n",
      "I tell you, have I offended any woman here in your halls\n",
      "by improper word or deed: in fact I did my best\n",
      "to stop any other suitor who began to behave that way!\n",
      "315\n",
      "But they took no notice, wouldn’t restrain their hands from mischief,\n",
      "and through such wanton misconduct have met a ghastly fate.\n",
      "Yet I, their soothsayer, who have done no wrong, will die\n",
      "along with them: there’s no gratitude for benefits received!”\n",
      "With an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n",
      "320\n",
      "“If, as you claim, you in fact are their soothsayer, then surely\n",
      "many times you’ll have made a prayer in my halls that the end\n",
      "of a sweet homecoming might be kept far from me, that you\n",
      "might be the one with whom my dear wife went, bore children!\n",
      "For that you won’t escape a most bitter death.”\n",
      "325\n",
      "So saying,\n",
      "he seized in his sturdy hand a sword that lay nearby:\n",
      "Agelaös had dropped it at the moment when he was killed.\n",
      "With this sword Odysseus now slashed through Leiōdēs’ neck.\n",
      "The man was still speaking as his head rolled in the dust.\n",
      "Terpēs’ son too, the minstrel, was still trying to avoid black fate—\n",
      "330\n",
      "Phēmios, who was compelled to perform among the suitors.\n",
      "He now stood holding the clear-toned lyre in his hands,\n",
      "close to the postern door, uncertain in his mind\n",
      "whether to slip from the hall and sit at the well-built altar\n",
      "of Zeus of Enclosures, on which Laërtēs and Odysseus\n",
      "335\n",
      "had burnt in his honor so many thighs of oxen,\n",
      "or whether to run to Odysseus, entreat him at his knees.\n",
      "And as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\n",
      "to run up and clasp the knees of Laërtēs’ son Odysseus.\n",
      "So he laid down his hollow lyre upon the floor\n",
      "340\n",
      "between the mixing-bowl and his silver-studded chair,\n",
      "and himself ran forward and clasped Odysseus by the knees,\n",
      "and addressed him with winged words, saying: “By your knees\n",
      "I entreat you, Odysseus! Respect me and pity me! On you\n",
      "hereafter shall sorrow be laid, if you choose to kill a minstrel\n",
      "345\n",
      "such as I am, who performs for both gods and mankind!\n",
      "I am self-taught, but the god has planted in my heart\n",
      "lays of all kinds: I’m equipped to perform before you\n",
      "as I would for a god—so don’t be too ready to cut my throat!\n",
      "Tēlemachos too, your dear son, could testify to the fact\n",
      "350\n",
      "that it was against my will, with no desire on my part,\n",
      "that I came to your house to sing for the suitors at their feasts—\n",
      "they were stronger, and far more of them: they made me come.”\n",
      "So he spoke. Tēlemachos, princely in power, heard him,\n",
      "and at once he addressed his nearby father, saying:\n",
      "355\n",
      "“Whatever you do, don’t maim this innocent man with the bronze!\n",
      "Let’s also spare Medōn the herald, who used to look after me\n",
      "here in our house while I was still a child—that is,\n",
      "if Philoitios or the swineherd hasn’t already killed him,\n",
      "or he ran into you when you were storming through the house.”\n",
      "360\n",
      "So he spoke, and Medōn, sagacious at heart, overheard him.\n",
      "He’d ducked down under a chair, and wrapped himself in\n",
      "the fresh-flayed hide of an ox, trying to avoid black fate.\n",
      "At once he got up from the chair, quickly threw off the oxhide,\n",
      "rushed forward, clasped Tēlemachos by the knees,\n",
      "365\n",
      "and uttering winged words then entreated him, saying:\n",
      "“Friend, here I am, it is I! Stay your hand, speak to your father,\n",
      "lest in his great strength he hurt me with the sharp bronze\n",
      "while incensed against these men, the suitors, who wasted\n",
      "his goods here in his halls, and—the fools!—paid you no honor.”\n",
      "370\n",
      "But resourceful Odysseus smiled, and then addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Relax! Tēlemachos here has protected you and saved you,\n",
      "so you may know in your heart, and pass the word to others,\n",
      "how much better kind actions are than mean ones! But for now\n",
      "leave the feast hall, go sit down outside in the courtyard,\n",
      "375\n",
      "away from the slaughter, you and the lay-rich minstrel,\n",
      "until I’ve finished the work I need to do here indoors.”\n",
      "So he spoke. The two now went off, out of the feast hall,\n",
      "and sat themselves down by great Zeus’ altar, glancing\n",
      "in all directions, still half-expecting to be murdered.\n",
      "380\n",
      "Odysseus too looked around, in his domain, to see whether\n",
      "any man, still alive, was hiding, in an effort to dodge black fate.\n",
      "But what he saw was each one of them in the blood and dust—\n",
      "the whole crowd, fallen, dead, like fish that fishermen\n",
      "have drawn in their fine-meshed net up from the grey sea\n",
      "385\n",
      "onto some crescent beach, and they all are lying there\n",
      "heaped up on the sand, sorely missing the waves of the sea;\n",
      "but Hēlios, the bright sun, now heats the life out of them—\n",
      "just so the suitors all lay there, heaped up upon one another.\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus now addressed Tēlemachos, saying:\n",
      "390\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, go and summon the nurse Eurykleia to me:\n",
      "There’s something I have on my mind that I need to say to her.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and Tēlemachos, in obedience to his father,\n",
      "went and opened the door, and called to Eurykleia, saying:\n",
      "“Up with you now, old woman—you who are in charge\n",
      "395\n",
      "of all the serving women we have in our hall—come here!\n",
      "My father is calling for you, he wants to say something to you.”\n",
      "So he spoke. Her own word remained unwinged: she opened\n",
      "the doors of the well-built feast hall, and came out, Tēlemachos\n",
      "leading the way before her. She found Odysseus\n",
      "400\n",
      "standing amid the bodies of the men he had killed,\n",
      "bespattered with blood and gore, like a lion that’s come\n",
      "from the farmstead where it’s been feeding on an ox, and all\n",
      "its breast and its jowls on either side are beslobbered\n",
      "with blood, so that it is a terrible sight to behold—\n",
      "405\n",
      "just so was Odysseus bespattered, hands and feet alike.\n",
      "But she, on beholding the corpses and the widespread bloodshed,\n",
      "began a cry of triumph, for the mighty deed she saw;\n",
      "but Odysseus stopped her, cut short her enthusiasm,\n",
      "and uttering winged words, addressed her, saying:\n",
      "410\n",
      "“Keep your joy to yourself, old woman—don’t exult aloud!\n",
      "It’s not decent to vaunt over men that have been killed.\n",
      "These dead were destroyed by divine fate and their own\n",
      "dastardly acts: they honored no mortals on this earth,\n",
      "either high or low, of those that came among them,\n",
      "415\n",
      "and so through their wanton deeds they met a sorry end.\n",
      "Now tell me about the women in this household—both those\n",
      "whose conduct dishonors me, and those that are innocent.”\n",
      "Then his dear nurse Eurykleia responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Very well, my child: I’ll tell you the truth of the matter.\n",
      "420\n",
      "Fifty women there are that live here in your halls,\n",
      "handmaids we taught to perform their various tasks,\n",
      "carding the wool while enduring a lifetime of servitude:\n",
      "of these there are twelve who chose the path of shamelessness,\n",
      "showing no respect for me or Penelopē herself—\n",
      "425\n",
      "Tēlemachos, though, only lately came of age: his mother\n",
      "hasn’t allowed him control over the women servants.\n",
      "But now, please, let me go to that bright upper chamber\n",
      "and break the news to your wife, whom some god’s kept asleep.”\n",
      "To her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n",
      "430\n",
      "“No, don’t wake her yet. But go and tell those women\n",
      "who’ve been guilty of shameful behavior to come in here, to me.”\n",
      "So he spoke. The old woman went out through the hall\n",
      "to bring the women his message, and order them to come;\n",
      "while Odysseus summoned Tēlemachos, as well as the cowherd\n",
      "435\n",
      "and swineherd, and addressed them with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Start removing the corpses now. Get the women to help you.\n",
      "Then have them clean off these elegant chairs and tables,\n",
      "washing them down with water, using porous sponges.\n",
      "When you’ve put the whole hall in proper order, then\n",
      "440\n",
      "take these maidservants out of the well-built hall, to a spot\n",
      "midway between the round house and the courtyard’s flawless wall,\n",
      "and cut them up with your long sharp swords till you’ve taken\n",
      "the life from them all and they’ve forgotten their Aphrodisiac\n",
      "pleasures under the suitors, lying with them clandestinely.”\n",
      "445\n",
      "As he spoke, the women arrived in a body, all sobbing\n",
      "desperately, all shedding big tears. So first of all\n",
      "they bore out the bodies of the slain, and stacked them\n",
      "under the colonnade of the well-walled courtyard,\n",
      "propped up against one another, while Odysseus directed\n",
      "450\n",
      "their work himself, hurrying them. They were forced to carry\n",
      "the corpses. Then they cleaned off the elegant chairs and tables,\n",
      "washing them down with water, using porous sponges.\n",
      "Tēlemachos meanwhile, with the cowherd and the swineherd,\n",
      "scraped off the floor of the close-built house with shovels,\n",
      "455\n",
      "and the women collected the scrapings, deposited them outside.\n",
      "Then, when they’d put the whole hall in proper order,\n",
      "they took the maidservants out of that well-built hall, to a spot\n",
      "midway between the round house and the courtyard’s flawless wall,\n",
      "and shut them in a tight corner, with no possible escape.\n",
      "460\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos now spoke first to the others, saying:\n",
      "“A clean death isn’t the way by which I want to end\n",
      "these women’s lives: they poured insults on my own head\n",
      "and my mother’s too, all while they were sleeping with the suitors.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and taking the cable of a dark-prowed vessel,\n",
      "465\n",
      "hitched one end to a tall pillar, the other about the round house,\n",
      "stretching it high, so no woman could touch the ground with her feet.5\n",
      "As when long-winged thrushes or doves are caught in the snare\n",
      "that’s been set for them in a thicket, as they’re flying back\n",
      "to their roosts, and hateful the bed that now welcomes them,\n",
      "470\n",
      "these women’s heads bobbed in a line, and round their necks\n",
      "nooses were set for all, to give them most piteous deaths:\n",
      "they jerked with their feet a little, but not for long.\n",
      "Then they brought Melanthios out, through the forecourt and yard,\n",
      "and cut off his nose and ears with the pitiless bronze,\n",
      "475\n",
      "and ripped out his private parts for the dogs to eat raw,\n",
      "and in their fury chopped off his hands and his feet.\n",
      "That done, they washed their own hands and feet, and went\n",
      "into the house to Odysseus, and their work was over.\n",
      "But he now addressed his dear nurse Eurykleia, saying:\n",
      "480\n",
      "“Bring sulfur, old woman, that cleanses pollution, and bring me\n",
      "fire, to make fumes that will purge the hall; then tell\n",
      "Penelopē to come down now, she and her handmaids,\n",
      "and have all the women servants in the house assemble here.”\n",
      "Then his dear nurse Eurykleia responded to him, saying:\n",
      "485\n",
      "“Yes indeed, my child, all this you’ve requested is in order.\n",
      "But please, let me bring you a mantle and tunic to wear—\n",
      "don’t stand like that in your hall with your broad shoulders\n",
      "clad only in rags: that would be just cause for censure.”\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "490\n",
      "“First of all, see that a fire is lit for me in the hall.”\n",
      "So he spoke; and his dear nurse Eurykleia did not\n",
      "disregard him, but fetched fire and sulfur; and Odysseus\n",
      "thoroughly purified hall and house and courtyard. Then\n",
      "the old woman went back through Odysseus’ fine domain\n",
      "495\n",
      "to bring word to the women, and order them to assemble;\n",
      "and out they came from their quarters, torches in their hands,\n",
      "and crowded round Odysseus, and embraced him,\n",
      "and clasped and kissed his head and his hands and shoulders\n",
      "in affectionate greeting, and a sweet longing possessed him\n",
      "500\n",
      "for crying and tears: each one of them was familiar to him.\n",
      "Book 23\n",
      "Chuckling, the old woman ascended to the upper chamber,\n",
      "to bring her mistress the news that her dear husband was there,\n",
      "in the house: her feet hobbled, but her knees moved briskly,\n",
      "and she stood at Penelopē’s head, and addressed her, saying:\n",
      "“Wake up, Penelopē, dear child, so you may see\n",
      "5\n",
      "with your own eyes what you’ve longed for all this time!\n",
      "Odysseus is here, back at last, late though his return!\n",
      "He’s slaughtered the haughty suitors who were preying on\n",
      "his household, devouring his property, bullying his son!”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē responded to her, saying:\n",

      "a halfwit and set him well on the road to wisdom!\n",
      "It’s they who’ve crazed you—you, who were once so sensible!\n",
      "Why do you mock me thus, when my heart’s full of sorrow,\n",
      "15\n",
      "talking in that wild way, arousing me from sleep—\n",
      "sweet sleep, that bound me fast, enfolded my eyelids? Never\n",
      "have I slept so soundly since that day when Odysseus\n",
      "left to set eyes on ill Ilion—that unspeakable name!\n",
      "Off with you now, back down to the women’s quarters—\n",
      "20\n",
      "and if any other woman, of all those who belong to me,\n",
      "had come to me with this story, and woken me up, for sure\n",
      "I’d have quickly sent her packing, back downstairs,\n",
      "in a way she’d regret! But here your old age shall save you.”\n",
      "Eurykleia, loyal nurse, then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "25\n",
      "“Dear child, I’m not mocking you! What I said is the truth!\n",
      "Odysseus is here, back home, exactly as I informed you:\n",
      "the stranger that all the men were insulting in the feast hall—\n",
      "that’s him! Tēlemachos learned who he was a while back,\n",
      "but he was discreet, kept his father’s plans well hidden\n",
      "30\n",
      "till he could punish the violence of these overbearing men.”\n",
      "So she spoke. Rejoicing, Penelopē sprang from her bed,\n",
      "and hugged the old woman, shedding tears from her eyelids,\n",

      "to lay hands on this crowd of shameless suitors—alone,\n",
      "while they always stay together when they’re in this house.”\n",
      "Eurykleia, loyal nurse, then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“I neither saw nor was told of it. I only heard the groaning\n",
      "40\n",
      "of men being killed. We sat, terrified, at the back\n",
      "of our well-built quarters, behind the close-fitting doors,\n",
      "until your son came in from the hall and called us—\n",
      "his father had sent Tēlemachos over to fetch us out.\n",
      "I found Odysseus standing among the slaughtered corpses:\n",
      "45\n",
      "they lay all around him, filled the hard-trodden floor,\n",
      "heaped on each other. To see him would have warmed your heart—\n",
      "all bespattered with blood and gore, like a lion, he was!\n",
      "All the bodies are now collected at the gates of the courtyard,\n",
      "in one pile, and he’s purifying his fine home with sulfur,\n",
      "50\n",
      "after kindling a large fire. He’s sent me to summon you.\n",
      "So come, that the hearts of you both may enter upon\n",
      "true happiness, after all the troubles that you’ve endured!\n",
      "Now at long last what you hoped for has been fulfilled:\n",
      "he’s come back himself, alive, to his own hearth, and found\n",
      "55\n",
      "both you and his son in his halls. As for those who mistreated him,\n",
      "the suitors, he’s been revenged on all of them in his house!”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē responded to her, saying: “Dear granny,\n",

      "you know how welcome his appearance here in these halls\n",
      "60\n",
      "would be to us all, but most to me, and the son born to us.\n",

      "some immortal’s slaughtered the haughty suitors, in wrath\n",
      "at their heartbreaking wantonness and their wicked deeds;\n",
      "for they had no respect for any dwellers upon this earth\n",
      "65\n",
      "whether high or low, whoever might come among them;\n",
      "so they’ve come to grief through their own mad folly. But Odysseus\n",
      "has lost, far away, his return to Achaia—and his life.”\n",
      "Eurykleia, loyal nurse, then responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“My child, what’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth,\n",
      "70\n",
      "saying your husband—who’s here, by the hearth downstairs!—\n",
      "will never return home? Your heart’s always so mistrustful!\n",
      "Look, here’s another clear proof that I’ll now tell you: the scar\n",
      "from that wound the white tusk of a boar dealt him long ago:\n",
      "I saw it while washing his feet, and wanted to break the news\n",
      "75\n",
      "to you yourself, but he put his hand over my mouth\n",
      "and in his great shrewdness of mind wouldn’t let me tell you.\n",
      "So come with me now, and I’ll put my own life at hazard:\n",
      "if I’m deceiving you, kill me, in the most painful manner!”\n",
      "To her prudent Penelopē responded, saying: “Dear granny,\n",

      "it’s hard for you to fathom the thoughts of the gods\n",
      "eternal, however intelligent you may be. Even so,\n",
      "let’s go down and join my son, for me to see these men,\n",
      "the suitors, dead, and whoever it was that killed them.”\n",
      "So saying, she set off downstairs, debating in her heart\n",
      "85\n",
      "whether to keep at a distance from—her own dear husband?\n",
      "or rather go to him, clasp his head and hands and kiss them?\n",
      "But when she’d come in, passing over the stone threshold,\n",
      "she sat down facing Odysseus, in the light from the fire,\n",
      "by the opposite wall. He was sitting against a tall pillar,\n",
      "90\n",
      "looking down, and waiting to see if his comely bedfellow\n",
      "would make any comment when she’d had a good look at him.\n",
      "But she sat long in silence, heart possessed by wonder,\n",
      "now with her eyes scrutinizing his face intensely,\n",
      "then failing to recognize him in the mean rags he wore.\n",
      "95\n",
      "Tēlemachos took her to task, and addressed her, saying:\n",

      "beside him, interrogate him, ask him questions?\n",
      "No other woman would thus, with obdurate heart,\n",
      "100\n",
      "hold aloof from a husband who, much hardship suffered,\n",
      "had, in the twentieth year, come back to his own country;\n",

      "To him\n",
      "Prudent Penelopē now responded, saying: “My child,\n",

      "find words with which to address or question him,\n",
      "or look him straight in the face. But if in actual truth\n",
      "he’s Odysseus, come back home, then undoubtedly we two\n",

      "signs known only to us—no one else has access to them.”\n",
      "110\n",
      "So she spoke. Noble much-enduring Odysseus smiled,\n",
      "and at once addressed Tēlemachos with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, let your mother now make trial of me here,\n",
      "in my own domain: soon enough she’ll understand much better.\n",
      "But at present, because I’m filthy, and clad in mean clothing,\n",
      "115\n",
      "she treats me with disrespect, won’t yet say I am he.\n",
      "For now, we need to consider how best to settle matters.\n",
      "A man who’s killed only a single soul in his district,\n",
      "even one without many to avenge him when he’s gone,\n",
      "still flees into exile, abandoning kin and country;\n",
      "120\n",
      "but we’ve slain the city’s mainstay, the very noblest\n",
      "of the youths on Ithákē: this you need to bear in mind.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Look to it yourself, dear father: they say yours is the best\n",
      "counsel of all mankind, that there’s no other mortal,\n",
      "125\n",
      "not one living person, that could compete with you!\n",
      "As for us, we’ll follow you eagerly, and I don’t think\n",
      "we’ll fall short in prowess, insofar as we have the power.”\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“So, I shall tell you the best course as I see it.\n",
      "130\n",
      "First all go and wash yourselves, then put on tunics,\n",
      "and tell the maids in their quarters to choose their dresses,\n",
      "and let the godlike minstrel with his clear-toned lyre\n",
      "act as our leader in the pleasures of dancing,\n",
      "so that any person outside who hears the sounds—\n",
      "135\n",
      "a neighbor or passerby—will assume it’s a wedding-feast.\n",
      "That way the news of the slaughter of these suitors\n",
      "won’t spread abroad through the district before we’ve gone\n",
      "out to our wooded farmstead, where we can then\n",
      "establish whatever advantage the Olympian may grant us.”\n",
      "140\n",
      "So he spoke. They all were listening, and readily obeyed him.\n",
      "First they went and washed and put on their tunics,\n",
      "and the women decked themselves out, and the godlike minstrel\n",
      "took up his hollow lyre, and aroused a longing in them\n",
      "for the pleasures of song and fine dancing. So the great hall\n",
      "145\n",
      "resounded all about with the noise made by the feet\n",
      "of dancing men, and well-dressed women, and thus\n",
      "might a person outside the house who heard them declare:\n",
      "“For sure, someone must have married the much-wooed queen!\n",
      "Hard-hearted she was, had no stomach to keep her wedded\n",
      "150\n",
      "husband’s domain right through, until he returned.”\n",
      "So they’d say,\n",
      "but knew nothing of the events that had in fact taken place.\n",
      "So now great-hearted Odysseus was washed in his own house\n",
      "by his housekeeper, Eurynomē: she massaged him with oil,\n",
      "and dressed him in an elegant mantle and a tunic,\n",
      "155\n",
      "while over his body Athēnē shed an abundance of beauty,\n",
      "making him taller and sturdier, and from his pate\n",
      "she conjured hair, thick and curling, like the hyacinth blossom.\n",
      "As happens when some craftsman overlays silver with gold—\n",
      "an expert, to whom Hephaistos and Pallas Athēnē have taught\n",
      "160\n",
      "every kind of technique, to embellish the works he creates—\n",
      "so she now shed grace over his head and shoulders,\n",
      "and he came from the bath in appearance like the immortals,\n",
      "and sat down again on the chair from which he’d risen,\n",
      "facing his wife; and he then addressed her, saying:\n",
      "165\n",
      "“Strange lady, to you, beyond all womankind, those\n",
      "who make their home on Olympos have given a stubborn spirit!\n",
      "No other woman would thus, with obdurate heart\n",
      "hold aloof from the husband who, much hardship suffered,\n",
      "had, in the twentieth year, come back to his own country!\n",
      "170\n",
      "Well, granny, spread me a bed, so that I can settle down\n",
      "here by myself, for the heart in her breast is of iron.”\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Strange sir, I’m being neither haughty nor indifferent,\n",
      "nor am I oversurprised. I know well what you looked like\n",
      "175\n",
      "when you sailed from Ithákē in that long-oared ship of yours.\n",
      "Come then, Eurykleia, make up the solid bedstead for him,\n",
      "outside the well-built bedroom that he himself constructed!\n",
      "There set the solid bedstead, and put bedding on it—\n",
      "fleeces, blankets, bright coverlets.”\n",
      "So she spoke,\n",
      "180\n",
      "making trial of her husband. But Odysseus in response\n",
      "burst out in anger, and addressed his true wife, saying:\n",
      "“Woman, this word you’ve said embitters my heart!\n",
      "Who’s moved my bed elsewhere? A hard job that would be,\n",
      "even for a skilled worker, unless some god came down\n",
      "185\n",
      "in person, and chose to shift it: easy enough for him!\n",
      "But of mortals no man alive, however young and strong,\n",
      "could dislodge it, for a great token was embodied\n",
      "in the bed that I fashioned—I, and no other man! There was\n",
      "a small long-leafed olive-tree that grew there in the courtyard,\n",
      "190\n",
      "flourishing, in its prime. Its girth was like a pillar.\n",
      "Round this I built our chamber, till it was finished,\n",
      "with close-set stones, and a sound roof overhead,\n",
      "and dovetailed doors I added, made to fit closely; then\n",
      "I lopped off the foliage of the long-leafed olive, trimmed\n",
      "195\n",
      "the trunk from the root up, made it smooth it with a bronze\n",
      "adze, well and expertly, shaped it true to the line,\n",
      "making it into a bedpost, bored holes in it with my auger.\n",
      "Beginning with that, I worked till I’d finished the whole bed,\n",
      "adorned it with inlays—gold, silver, ivory—then latticed\n",
      "200\n",
      "the bed frame with thongs of oxhide, dyed bright purple.\n",
      "Thus I describe this token to you—though I’ve no idea\n",
      "if this bed of mine’s still in place, wife, or whether by now\n",
      "some man’s severed the olive’s trunk, and moved it elsewhere.”\n",
      "So he spoke. Her knees and heart were undone on the spot,\n",
      "205\n",
      "since well she knew the sure tokens that Odysseus had described.\n",
      "Then she ran straight to him in tears, and flung her arms\n",
      "about his neck, kissed his face, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Don’t be angry with me, Odysseus! In all other matters\n",
      "you’ve been the wisest of men—the gods it was brought us grief,\n",
      "210\n",
      "begrudging that we two should remain one with the other,\n",
      "enjoy our joint life together from youth to the brink of old age.\n",
      "But please don’t now get cross or take me to task because\n",
      "at first sight I didn’t, as now, give you a loving welcome!\n",
      "The heart in my breast was always terrified lest some man\n",
      "215\n",
      "might turn up here, beguile me with his specious story—\n",
      "many there are who scheme for their own low profit!\n",
      "Not even Argive Helen, Zeus’ progeny, would have coupled\n",
      "in love and bed with that foreigner had she but known\n",
      "the Achaians’ warlike sons were going to fetch her back\n",
      "220\n",
      "to her own home and country. In her case a god\n",
      "incited her to commit her improper act: not till then\n",
      "did she put in her mind that ghastly act of mad folly,\n",
      "that first brought such grief upon us as well. But now—\n",
      "since you’ve already recounted, clear and plain, the tokens\n",
      "225\n",
      "of this bed of ours, seen by no other living mortal\n",
      "except you and me alone, and one solitary handmaid,\n",
      "Aktōr’s daughter, a gift from my father, before I came here,\n",
      "the doorkeeper of our close-built bridal chamber now—\n",
      "you’ve convinced my heart, all too stubborn though it was.”\n",
      "230\n",
      "So she spoke, and stirred in his heart yet more the urge to cry,\n",
      "and he wept as he held in his arms his loyal beloved wife,\n",
      "and welcome as is the appearance of dry land to men swimming,\n",
      "men whose strong ship Poseidōn has wrecked out on the deep,\n",
      "as it’s driven on by the gale and the cresting waves,\n",
      "235\n",
      "and few have made it to land out of the grey salt sea\n",
      "by swimming, and thick is the brine that’s crusted on their bodies,\n",
      "and glad they are to have got ashore, and escaped disaster—\n",
      "so welcome to her was her husband as she looked upon him,\n",
      "never relaxing the hold of her white arms round his neck.\n",
      "240\n",
      "Indeed, rosy-fingered Dawn would have risen while they wept\n",
      "had the goddess, grey-eyed Athēnē, not planned things otherwise.\n",
      "The night’s last stage she prolonged, while holding up\n",
      "golden-throned Dawn at Ocean, and not permitting her\n",
      "to yoke up her swift-footed horses, bringing light to mankind—\n",
      "245\n",
      "Phaethōn and Lampos, the colts that draw Dawn’s chariot.\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus addressed his wife, saying: “Not yet\n",
      "have we reached the conclusion, my wife, of all our trials:\n",
      "there’s a measureless task still awaiting us in the future,\n",
      "both long and hard: I need to accomplish this in full.\n",
      "250\n",
      "That’s what the ghost of Teirēsias prophesied to me\n",
      "on the day I ventured down into the realm of Hadēs\n",
      "to enquire about my comrades’ homecoming, and my own.\n",
      "But come, my wife, let’s to bed, so that now, at last, soothed\n",
      "by sweet sleep, we may find our joy and comfort together.”\n",
      "255\n",
      "Then prudent Penelopē responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Your bed shall be ready for you whenever your heart\n",
      "is so inclined, now the gods have managed your return\n",
      "to your well-built home, and to your native country:\n",
      "but since you’ve thought of this, and a god’s put it in your mind,\n",
      "260\n",
      "tell me what this trial is—I fancy I’ll learn its nature\n",
      "soon enough: no bad thing to know of it in advance.”\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“Strange lady, why do you now so urgently want me\n",
      "to tell you this? Well, I’ll do so, I’ll keep nothing secret.\n",
      "265\n",
      "But your heart will get no joy of it, nor am I myself\n",
      "happy about it. Teirēsias said I must travel to numerous\n",
      "cities of men, while holding a well-shaped oar in my hands,\n",
      "until I come among men who know nothing of the sea,\n",
      "who eat their food without flavoring it with salt\n",
      "270\n",
      "and have never set eyes on ships with purple cheeks\n",
      "or on the well-shaped oars that serve as a ship’s wings;\n",
      "and he told me a manifest sign, one that wouldn’t escape me:\n",
      "when on the road I encounter another man who believes\n",
      "what I have on my sturdy shoulder is a winnowing-fan,\n",
      "275\n",
      "I’m to fix my well-shaped oar on end in the ground,\n",
      "and offer a lavish sacrifice to the lord Poseidōn—\n",
      "a ram, a bull, and a stud boar that mounts its sows.\n",
      "I then must come back home, make rich sacred offerings\n",
      "to the immortal gods who possess broad heaven,\n",
      "280\n",
      "in due order. Death will come to me from the sea,\n",
      "the gentlest of ends, that will take me only when\n",
      "I’ve worn out a sleek old age, with my people round me\n",
      "prospering. All of this, he told me, would come to pass.”\n",
      "Prudent Penelopē then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "285\n",
      "“If indeed the gods are allowing you a better old age,\n",
      "then there’s hope that we’ll get a chance to escape our troubles.”\n",
      "Such was the conversation between them. All this while\n",
      "the nurse and Eurynomē were making up their bed\n",
      "with soft bedclothes, under the light of flaming torches;\n",
      "290\n",
      "and when they’d hastily readied the solid bedstead,\n",
      "the old nurse went off to sleep in her own quarters,\n",
      "while Eurynomē, maid of the bedchamber, conducted them\n",
      "on their way to bed, holding a torch on her hand.\n",
      "After escorting them there she too retired, while they\n",
      "295\n",
      "happily rediscovered the world of their old-time bed.\n",
      "Tēlemachos and the cowherd and the swineherd now\n",
      "stopped their feet from dancing, stopped the women too,\n",
      "and lay down to sleep themselves, in the shadowy halls.\n",
      "When the couple had had their fill of passionate lovemaking,\n",
      "300\n",
      "they got pleasure from conversation, chatting to one another.\n",
      "She, bright among women, told of all she’d borne in the halls,\n",
      "having to watch the destructive crowd of suitors, those who,\n",
      "with her as excuse, had slaughtered many cattle and fat sheep,\n",
      "while too much wine was drawn from the storage jars; while he,\n",
      "305\n",
      "Zeus-born Odysseus, recounted all the woes he’d inflicted\n",
      "on others, and all he’d endured with pain himself;\n",
      "and she heard him out with delight, and sweet sleep never\n",
      "was shed on her eyelids until his whole tale was told.\n",
      "He began with how he’d first overcome the Kikones,\n",
      "310\n",
      "then came to the rich terrain of the lotus-eating men;\n",
      "and all that the Kyklōps did, and the price he made him pay\n",
      "for those of his sturdy comrades he’d pitilessly devoured;\n",
      "and then how he came to Aiolos, who readily welcomed him,\n",
      "and gave him conveyance—but he was not yet fated to reach\n",
      "315\n",
      "his own land: once again the storm wind snatched him up\n",
      "and bore him, heavily groaning, over the fish-rich deep;\n",
      "then how he’d come to Tēlepylos, where the Laistrygonians\n",
      "destroyed his ships and all his well-greaved comrades,\n",
      "Odysseus alone escaping in his black ship. He next\n",
      "320\n",
      "recounted all of Kirkē’s deceits and contrivances,\n",
      "how he’d gone in his many-oared ship to Hadēs’ dank domain,\n",
      "to consult the spirit of Theban Teirēsias; and how\n",
      "there he’d seen every one of his former companions,\n",
      "besides the mother who bore him, and nursed him as a child;\n",
      "325\n",
      "how he’d heard the voice of the Sirens, unceasing singers;\n",
      "how he’d come to the Wandering Rocks, and to dread Charybdis\n",
      "and Skyllē, from whom till then no man had escaped unscathed;\n",
      "and how his comrades had slaughtered the cattle of Hēlios;\n",
      "and how his swift ship had been struck by a smoldering bolt\n",
      "330\n",
      "from high-thundering Zeus, and his fine comrades died together,\n",
      "all of them: he alone got clear of the grim death spirits;\n",
      "how he came to the isle of Ōgygia and the nymph Kalypsō,\n",
      "who kept him there, longing to have him as her husband,\n",
      "in her hollow caves, and looked after him, and declared\n",
      "335\n",
      "she would make him immortal and ageless all his days,\n",
      "yet never could win over the heart in his breast; and how\n",
      "after many hardships endured he reached the Phaiakians,\n",
      "who treated him with high honor, as though he were a god,\n",
      "and conveyed him home in a ship to his native country\n",
      "340\n",
      "with presents of bronze and gold and apparel. This concluded\n",
      "the tale as he told it and was when sweet limb-loosening\n",
      "sleep sprang on him, dissolving his heart’s anxieties.\n",
      "The grey-eyed goddess Athēnē now had another idea.\n",
      "When she figured Odysseus had had his fill of pleasure\n",
      "345\n",
      "from bedding his wife and sleeping, she at once aroused\n",
      "from Ocean the Dawn, early risen and golden-throned,\n",
      "to bring light to mankind; and now Odysseus arose\n",
      "from his soft bed, and gave a charge to Penelopē, saying:\n",
      "“My wife, by now we’ve had a surfeit of endless trials,\n",
      "350\n",
      "both of us, you here weeping over my troubled homecoming,\n",
      "while Zeus and the other deities hobbled me with hardships\n",
      "far from my own country, though I longed to be back!\n",
      "But now we’ve come at last to the marriage bed we yearned for,\n",
      "you’ll care for such possessions as I have here in the halls;\n",
      "355\n",
      "and as for the flocks that these haughty suitors have wasted,\n",
      "I’ll get a good many by raiding, and others that the Achaians\n",
      "will give me, until we’ve replenished every last empty stall!\n",
      "My first task now is to visit my wooded farmstead and see\n",
      "my sturdy old father, who’s so distressed on my account.\n",
      "360\n",
      "And on you, wife, I lay this charge, as a sensible woman:\n",
      "Beginning at sunrise the word will very soon get around\n",
      "concerning these men, the suitors, whom I slew in our halls;\n",
      "so both you and your women servants must go upstairs\n",
      "to your chamber and sit there: no peeping, don’t ask questions.”\n",
      "365\n",
      "That said, he arranged his fine armor about his shoulders,\n",
      "woke up Tēlemachos and the cowherd and the swineherd,\n",
      "and ordered them all to lay hands on their war gear. They\n",
      "did not disregard him, but donned their bronze body armor,\n",
      "and opened the doors and went out, with Odysseus leading.\n",
      "370\n",
      "Light already was over the earth, but Athēnē concealed them\n",
      "in darkness, and led them out quickly from the city.\n",
      "Book 24\n",
      "Hermēs, god of Kyllēnē, now summoned forth the ghosts\n",
      "of the men who’d been suitors: he held the staff in his hands—\n",
      "exquisite, golden—with which he bemuses the eyes\n",
      "of those he wishes, while others he conjures out of their sleep.\n",
      "This he used to herd and to lead them: they followed him, squeaking.\n",
      "5\n",
      "As in the furthest recesses of some vast cave the bats\n",
      "flit about squeaking when one of them falls down the rock face\n",
      "from the chain they form, clinging closely one to another,\n",
      "so these went along with him, squeaking. Hermēs the healer\n",
      "conducted them down dank and moldering pathways:\n",
      "10\n",
      "by the streams of Ocean they went, and the White Rock,\n",
      "they went by the gates of the sun and the region of dreams,\n",
      "and quickly they now arrived at the meadow of asphodels,\n",
      "where ghosts dwell, the shades of those whose toils are over.\n",
      "There they found the ghost of Pēleus’ son Achillēs,\n",
      "15\n",
      "and those of Patroklos and of peerless Antilochos,\n",
      "and of Aias, unmatched for handsomeness and stature\n",
      "among all the Danaäns, save for Pēleus’ peerless son.\n",
      "So these gathered round Achillēs. Close to them now\n",
      "there came the ghost of Atreus’ son Agamemnōn,\n",
      "20\n",
      "grieving; and round him clustered the ghosts of all those\n",
      "who’d died and met their fate with him in Aigisthos’ house;\n",
      "and the first ghost to address him was the son of Pēleus, saying:\n",
      "“Son of Atreus, we had this belief that Zeus, the hurler of bolts,\n",
      "loved you above other heroes, for all your days, because\n",
      "25\n",
      "you were lord over many brave men out there in the land\n",
      "of the Trojans, where we Achaians suffered much hardship.\n",
      "Yet on you as well there was fated to come too early\n",
      "that deadly destiny which no mortal born can avoid—\n",
      "Would that, while still enjoying your royal power,\n",
      "30\n",
      "you’d encountered your death and fate in Trojan country!\n",
      "“Then all the Achaians would have made you a burial mound,\n",
      "and great glory would have been yours, and your son’s, hereafter,\n",
      "whereas now you’ve been doomed to suffer a most piteous death.”\n",
      "Then the ghost of the son of Atreus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "35\n",
      "“Ah, fortunate son of Peleus, godlike Achilles: you died\n",
      "out at Troy, far from Argos, and around you others were slain,\n",
      "the finest sons of the Trojans and the Achaians,\n",
      "fighting over your body; amid the swirling dust\n",
      "great in your greatness you lay, your horsemanship forgotten.\n",
      "40\n",
      "That whole day we battled; we’d never have quit fighting\n",
      "had Zeus not unleashed a hurricane, and stopped us.\n",
      "But when we’d carried you out of the battle to the ships,\n",
      "we laid you on a litter, and cleansed your splendid body\n",
      "with warm water and unguents, and the Danaäns shed\n",
      "45\n",
      "many warm tears over you, cut off locks of their hair.\n",
      "Your mother came up from the sea with her immortal sea nymphs\n",
      "when she heard the news: a cry echoed over the deep,\n",
      "a strange cry, and panic now seized on all the Achaians:\n",
      "they’d have taken off and run for it, back to the hollow ships,\n",
      "50\n",
      "had they not been checked by a man versed in ancient wisdom—\n",
      "Nestōr: even before this his counsel had seemed the best.\n",
      "He with friendly intent now addressed the assembly, saying:\n",
      "‘Stop this, you Argives! Don’t flee, you Achaian youths!\n",
      "It’s his mother, come from the sea with her immortal sea nymphs\n",
      "55\n",
      "in her concern for the death of her own son.’\n",
      "“So he spoke,\n",
      "and the great-hearted Achaians abandoned their panic flight.\n",
      "Round you gathered the daughters of the Old Man of the Sea1\n",
      "lamenting piteously, wrapped you in ambrosial clothing;\n",
      "all the Nine Muses with their sweet antiphonal voices\n",
      "60\n",
      "now led the dirge—there wasn’t a single tearless Argive\n",
      "to be seen, so deeply did the clear-toned Muse affect them.\n",
      "So for seventeen days, by night as well as by day,\n",
      "we mourned you, immortal gods and mortal men together;\n",
      "then on the eighteenth we surrendered you to the fire,\n",
      "65\n",
      "and many fat sheep and crumple-horned oxen we slaughtered\n",
      "around you; you were burned in the gods’ own clothing\n",
      "with a wealth of sweet honey and unguents: many Achaian heroes\n",
      "footed it round the pyre in their war gear while you burned,\n",
      "foot soldiers and horsemen both: a great clamor arose.\n",
      "70\n",
      "But when Hephaistos’ flames had finished their work,\n",
      "at dawn we collected your white bones, Achilles,\n",
      "in unmixed wine and fine oil. Your mother had given us\n",
      "a golden two-handled jar: a present from Dionysos,\n",
      "she said, and the work of renowned Hephaistos. In this\n",
      "75\n",
      "your white bones now lie, illustrious Achilles,\n",
      "mingled with those of dead Patroklos, Menoitios’ son;\n",
      "separate are those of Antilochos, whom you honored\n",
      "above all your comrades, save only dead Patroklos. Over them\n",
      "we heaped up a huge and matchless burial mound—\n",
      "80\n",
      "we, the sacred army of Argive spearmen—on\n",
      "a prominent headland by the broad Hellespont,2\n",
      "to be visible far out at sea both to men now living\n",
      "and those yet unborn hereafter. And your mother\n",
      "sought and obtained from the gods most exquisite prizes\n",
      "85\n",
      "and set them in mid-arena to be won by the best Achaians.\n",
      "Before now you’ve been present at the funeral games of many\n",
      "heroes, when on the occasion of a king’s demise\n",
      "young men gird themselves up and prepare to compete\n",
      "for prizes; had you seen these ones you’d have been astounded\n",
      "90\n",
      "by the sheer beauty of the prizes the goddess, silver-footed\n",
      "Thetis, set up in your honor: most dear to the gods you were!\n",
      "So not even in death did you lose your name, but forever\n",
      "your noble renown, Achilles, shall be known to all mankind.\n",
      "But what pleasure had I from this—that I wound up the war?\n",
      "95\n",
      "For on my return Zeus contrived me a most miserable end,\n",
      "at the hands of Aigisthos and my accursed wife.”\n",
      "Such was the conversation between them, one to the other.\n",
      "The Escort, the slayer of Argos, now approached them,\n",
      "leading down the ghosts of those suitors whom Odysseus had killed;\n",
      "100\n",
      "The two, amazed by the sight, went straight to meet them.\n",
      "The ghost of Agamemnōn, Atreus’ son, recognized\n",
      "Melaneus’ dear son, far-famed Amphimedōn, who\n",
      "had his home on Ithákē, and whose guest-friend he’d once been.\n",
      "Atreus’ son was the first to speak, and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "105\n",
      "“Amphimedōn, what befell you, all picked men of like age,\n",
      "to bring you here, down below the dark earth? Not otherwise\n",
      "would one make one’s list if selecting the best men in the city!\n",
      "Was it Poseidōn destroyed you aboard your vessels\n",
      "by stirring up the dread blast of hard-blowing gales?\n",
      "110\n",
      "Or did hostile men work your destruction on dry land\n",
      "when you were lifting their cattle and fine fleecy sheep\n",
      "or fighting them for their city and for their women?\n",
      "Answer my question! I declare that I’m your guest-friend—\n",
      "Don’t you recall the time I came there to your house\n",
      "115\n",
      "with godlike Menelaös, to persuade Odysseus\n",
      "to accompany us to Ilion on the well-benched ships?3\n",
      "A whole month the journey took us, crossing the broad deep,\n",
      "for hard it was to persuade Odysseus the city-sacker.”\n",
      "Then the ghost of Amphimedōn responded to him, saying:\n",
      "120\n",
      "“Most glorious son of Atreus, Agamemnōn, king of men,\n",
      "I recall these events, Zeus’ nursling, just as you recount them;\n",
      "and now I in turn shall tell you, truthfully and in full,\n",
      "what led to our nasty death, how the whole thing happened.\n",
      "We were courting the wife of the long-absent Odysseus:\n",
      "125\n",
      "she neither rejected nor made this marriage that she hated,\n",
      "but—while planning death and black fate for us—\n",
      "privately conceived this other trick in her mind.\n",
      "In her halls she set up a great loom, and started weaving—\n",
      "very broad was the web, fine of thread—and said to us then:\n",
      "130\n",
      "‘You young men, my suitors now noble Odysseus is dead,\n",
      "be patient, though eager to wed me, until I finish\n",
      "this web: I should not want my woven work to be wasted—\n",
      "a shroud for the hero Laërtēs, against that day\n",
      "when the grim fate of pitiless death shall overtake him:\n",
      "135\n",
      "then the local Achaian women won’t be able to blame me\n",
      "for a man who’d won so much being left with no winding-sheet.’\n",
      "“So she spoke; our proud hearts assented to what she said.\n",
      "From then on, day after day, she’d be weaving at the great loom,\n",
      "but at night she’d have torches set up, and undo her work.\n",
      "140\n",
      "Thus for three years she beguiled and persuaded the Achaians;\n",
      "but when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round,\n",
      "and the months wore away, and day after day passed by,\n",
      "then one of her women, who knew the truth, informed us,\n",
      "and we caught her undoing her work at that splendid loom.\n",
      "145\n",
      "So she finished it off perforce, though against her will,\n",
      "and showed it to us when she’d woven it on the great web\n",
      "and washed it: it shone like the sun or the moon. It was then\n",
      "that some evil spirit brought Odysseus from who knows where\n",
      "to the border of his estate, where the swineherd lived.\n",
      "150\n",
      "Thither too there came the dear son of godlike Odysseus,\n",
      "on his way back in his black ship from sandy Pylos;\n",
      "and the two of them, after planning a nasty death for the suitors,\n",
      "returned to the famous town, Odysseus later,\n",
      "but Tēlemachos going on ahead of him. Now the swineherd\n",
      "155\n",
      "brought in Odysseus, meanly garbed, and made\n",
      "to look like a miserable beggar, of a great age\n",
      "and propped on a staff. The clothes he wore were ragged.\n",
      "No man among us, not even the older ones, when he\n",
      "appeared out of nowhere could tell who he really was:\n",
      "160\n",
      "we all assailed him with insults, threw things at him.\n",
      "He for a while, set firm in his purpose, put up\n",
      "with being pelted and taunted there his own domain;\n",
      "but when the intent of Zeus of the aegis stirred him,\n",
      "with Tēlemachos’ help he removed all the first-class war gear,\n",
      "165\n",
      "stowed it away in a storeroom and bolted the door.\n",
      "Then, in his crafty planning, he instructed his wife to set\n",
      "before the suitors his bow and the grey iron, as a contest—\n",
      "and the beginning of death—for us ill-fated men.\n",
      "Not one of us was able to draw and notch the string\n",
      "170\n",
      "of his powerful bow: we all fell far short of that.\n",
      "But when the great bow was passed into Odysseus’ hands,\n",
      "then we all of us made a great outcry, shouted aloud\n",
      "not to give him the bow, whatever he might say.\n",
      "Only Tēlemachos urged him on, and told him to try it.\n",
      "175\n",
      "So the noble much-enduring Odysseus grasped the bow,\n",
      "and easily strung it, and sent an arrow through the iron.\n",
      "Then he went and stood on the threshold, and emptied out\n",
      "his swift shafts, glancing round fiercely, and shot the prince\n",
      "Antinoös, then let fly at the others his hurtful arrows,\n",
      "180\n",
      "taking sure aim. The men fell thick and fast, and now\n",
      "it became very clear that some god was his helper,\n",
      "for suddenly sallying forth they raged from room to room\n",
      "killing men on all sides, and a ghastly clamor went up\n",
      "as heads were stove in, and the whole floor ran with blood.\n",
      "185\n",
      "So we all died, Agamemnōn; and even now our bodies\n",
      "are still lying there, uncared-for, in the halls of Odysseus,\n",
      "since the dear ones in each man’s home as yet know nothing of it—\n",
      "those who’d wash the black gore away from our wounds,\n",
      "and lay us out, keening: the proper privilege of the dead.”\n",
      "190\n",
      "Then the ghost of the son of Atreus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Ah, fortunate son of Laërtēs, resourceful Odysseus!\n",
      "Truly endowed with great virtue was the bedfellow you won!\n",
      "How excellent was the mind-set of Ikarios’ daughter,\n",
      "blameless Penelopē, how well she remembered Odysseus,\n",
      "195\n",
      "her wedded husband! And so the renown of her great virtue\n",
      "shall never perish, because the immortals shall make a charming\n",
      "song for men here on earth, about constant Penelopē!\n",
      "Not such was Tyndareus’ daughter, who did a wicked deed,\n",
      "killing her wedded husband: loathsome the song about her\n",
      "200\n",
      "left to posterity, and vile the repute she bequeathed\n",
      "to all womankind, even those who conduct was virtuous.”\n",
      "Such was the conversation they had with one another,\n",
      "standing in Hadēs’ domain, deep down below the earth.\n",
      "The others now, leaving the city, soon arrived at Laërtēs’\n",
      "205\n",
      "farmstead, fine and well-cultivated, which he’d acquired\n",
      "long ago, and heavy the labor that he’d expended on it.\n",
      "This was his home. All round it ran the outhouses in which\n",
      "there ate, sat, and slept those who were his servants\n",
      "out of necessity, working at whatever he wanted. Inside\n",
      "210\n",
      "the house lived an old Sikel4 woman, who took good care\n",
      "of the old man himself, on his farmstead, far from the city.\n",
      "Odysseus addressed his servants and son, saying: “You go now\n",
      "into his well-built house, and quickly choose and slaughter\n",
      "for dinner the very best of the hogs; but as for me,\n",
      "215\n",
      "I mean to make trial of my father, find out whether he\n",
      "will recognize me, know who I am when he sees me,\n",
      "or fail to know me, since I’ve been away so long.”\n",
      "So saying, he handed over his war gear to his servants.\n",
      "They then hastened into the house, but Odysseus\n",
      "220\n",
      "went off to the flourishing vineyard to carry out his test.\n",
      "As he entered the large orchard he did not find Dolios,\n",
      "or any of his slaves or his sons: they’d all gone off\n",
      "collecting stones to make a wall for the vineyard,\n",
      "with the old man leading the way. Instead he found\n",
      "225\n",
      "his father alone in the well-constructed vineyard,\n",
      "digging around a plant, in a filthy tunic,\n",
      "patched and shabby, and round his shins he’d fastened\n",
      "stitched leggings of oxhide, to stop him getting scratched,\n",
      "with gloves on his hands against the thorns, and above them\n",
      "230\n",
      "on his head a goatskin cap—all fostering his sorrow.\n",
      "When much-enduring noble Odysseus saw him thus,\n",
      "worn out by old age, and with great grief in his heart,\n",
      "standing below a tall pear tree he shed tears, as he\n",
      "debated in mind and heart what it was he should do next:\n",
      "235\n",
      "should he kiss and embrace his father, tell him all\n",
      "about how he’d returned, come back to his own country;\n",
      "or should he first ask him questions, test him on details?\n",
      "And as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\n",
      "to make trial of him to begin with, use bantering language.\n",
      "240\n",
      "With this in mind noble Odysseus went directly to him.\n",
      "Laërtēs, head down, was still digging around the plant:\n",
      "his illustrious son came up and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Old man, you’ve no lack of skill, the way you tend this orchard!\n",
      "You take good care of it all, there isn’t one thing here—\n",
      "245\n",
      "plant or fig tree, vine, pear tree, olive, or even\n",
      "the vegetable plot—that lacks proper cultivation!\n",
      "But I do have to tell you, and please don’t take offense:\n",
      "your person is not well cared for: you endure a wretched\n",
      "old age, you’re unpleasantly filthy, you wear foul clothes.\n",
      "250\n",
      "Why doesn’t your master look after you? Not, clearly, because\n",
      "you’re idle! There’s nothing slavish about your appearance,\n",
      "in bearing or stature: you’re like a man who’s a king—\n",
      "the kind of person who, when he’s bathed and eaten,\n",
      "should sleep soft. And that’s the proper way for the old!\n",
      "255\n",
      "Now come, tell me this, and answer me truthfully:\n",
      "What man’s servant are you? Whose orchard is this you tend?\n",
      "And tell me this truly also, so I may be certain:\n",
      "Is this really Ithákē I’ve come to, as a man informed me\n",
      "whom I encountered just now as I made my way here?\n",
      "260\n",
      "He wasn’t very clear-headed: he didn’t manage to tell me\n",
      "any particulars, or listen to what I said when I asked him\n",
      "about a guest-friend of mine: does he still live, exist?\n",
      "Or is he dead already, and in Hādēs’ domain? I shall\n",
      "speak plainly to you: pay attention and hear me out!\n",
      "265\n",
      "I once, in my own country, entertained a man\n",
      "who’d come to our house, and no other mortal yet\n",
      "of all remote-dwelling strangers was more welcome there.\n",
      "By descent he was, he said, from Ithákē: he told me\n",
      "his own father was Laërtēs, the son of Arkeisios.\n",
      "270\n",
      "I escorted him to our house, and welcomed him properly\n",
      "with full entertainment from our rich household store;\n",
      "and I offered him gifts of guest-friendship, such as are fitting—\n",
      "of fine-wrought gold I bestowed on him seven talents,\n",
      "and a mixing-bowl all of silver, adorned with flowers,\n",
      "275\n",
      "a dozen plain cloaks, the same number of rugs and blankets,\n",
      "and as many beautiful mantles, with matching tunics;\n",
      "women I also gave him, skilled in fine handiwork,\n",
      "four of them, very attractive, the ones he fancied himself.”\n",
      "Then his father responded to him, shedding tears:\n",
      "280\n",
      "“Stranger, indeed you’ve come to the land about which you ask;\n",
      "but outrageous and reckless men are now masters of it,\n",
      "and these countless gifts you bestowed were given in vain,\n",
      "for if you’d found him alive in this land of Ithákē\n",
      "he’d have sent you on your way with ample gifts in exchange,\n",
      "285\n",
      "after generous entertainment, the due right of the one\n",
      "who began it. Come, tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\n",
      "How many years is it now since you entertained that guest,\n",
      "your unfortunate guest—my son, if he ever existed,\n",
      "my ill-fated son! Far from friends and homeland, either\n",
      "290\n",
      "fish have doubtless devoured him out in the deep, or else\n",
      "he’s fallen prey on land to wild beasts and birds. Neither\n",
      "his mother nor I, his parents, mourned and enshrouded him;\n",
      "nor did prudent Penelopē, his well-dowered wife,\n",
      "keen over her own husband, as was fitting, on his bier\n",
      "295\n",
      "after closing his eyes—the proper entitlement of the dead.\n",
      "And tell me this truly also, so I may be certain:\n",
      "Who are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\n",
      "Where is the swift ship moored that brought you hither\n",
      "with your godlike comrades? Or did you pay your passage\n",
      "300\n",
      "aboard another’s vessel, so they put you off, and sailed on?”\n",
      "Then resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“I will give you a full and truthful account of these things.\n",
      "I come from Alybas, where I live in a well-known house,\n",
      "and I’m the son of Apheidas, Lord Polypēmōn’s son:\n",
      "305\n",
      "my own name is Epēritos. Some god drove me off course\n",
      "from Sikaníē,5 landed me here against my will. My ship’s\n",
      "out there, beached off farmland, far distant from the city.\n",
      "But as for Odysseus, this is now the fifth year since\n",
      "he departed from there and left my native country—\n",
      "310\n",
      "ill-fated man! Yet he had good omens on setting out—\n",
      "birds on the right: I was glad of them as I sent him on his way,\n",
      "and he was glad at departure. We both had high hopes\n",
      "of meeting again as guest-friends, and exchanging splendid gifts.”\n",
      "So he spoke. A black cloud of grief now covered Laërtēs:\n",
      "315\n",
      "with both hands he gathered up the dark grimy dust,\n",
      "poured it over his grizzled head, ceaselessly groaning.\n",
      "Odysseus’ heart was stirred, and up through his nostrils\n",
      "rose a strong sharp pang as he looked at his dear father.\n",
      "He sprang forward, embraced and kissed him, exclaiming: “Father,\n",
      "320\n",
      "I myself, here, am the man about whom you ask,\n",
      "come back in the twentieth year to my own country!\n",
      "So stop your weeping and tearful lamentation,\n",
      "for I’ll explain everything. But we urgently need to hurry—\n",
      "I’ve killed the suitors who were occupying our house,\n",
      "325\n",
      "in revenge for their outrageous conduct and wicked acts.”\n",
      "Then Laërtēs responded to him, saying: “If it’s true\n",
      "that you who’ve come here are indeed my son, Odysseus,\n",
      "then give me some certain proof that will convince me.”\n",
      "To him resourceful Odysseus responded, saying: “Firstly,\n",
      "330\n",
      "take a close look at this scar, from a wound I was dealt\n",
      "by the white tusk of a boar out up on Parnassos, when\n",
      "I went there because you sent me, you and my lady mother,\n",
      "to my mother’s father Autolykos, to collect the gifts\n",
      "he’d agreed and promised to give me when he came here.\n",
      "335\n",
      "Look, I’ll also tell you the trees that you once gave me\n",
      "in our well-laid-out orchard: I asked for each one as I\n",
      "accompanied you through the garden—I was still a child.\n",
      "It was these very trees we passed by, and you named them for me,\n",
      "and told me about each one. Thirteen pear trees you gave me,\n",
      "340\n",
      "ten apple trees, forty fig trees. Rows of vines too you named,\n",
      "and promised me fifty of these, to ripen at different times,\n",
      "with clusters of grapes upon them at every stage, depending\n",
      "on when Zeus’ seasons brought them to their heaviest weight.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and his father’s knees and heart gave way\n",
      "345\n",
      "as he recognized the sure signs that Odysseus had given him.\n",
      "He embraced his dear son; but then noble much-enduring\n",
      "Odysseus caught and held him close as he fainted. But when\n",
      "he came round again, and the spirit revived in his breast,\n",
      "he responded once more, and spoke, saying: “Zeus, Father,\n",
      "350\n",
      "you gods indeed still exist on high Olympos, if it’s true\n",
      "that the suitors have paid the price for their wanton violence!\n",
      "But now I’m terribly scared at heart that very soon all\n",
      "the men of Ithákē will come here against us, and send\n",
      "urgent messages out to the Kephallēnian cities.”\n",
      "355\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus now responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“Never fear, don’t let these matters disturb your mind!\n",
      "And now let’s go to your house near the orchard, for I sent\n",
      "Tēlemachos on ahead, with the cowherd and swineherd,\n",
      "to quickly prepare a meal there.”\n",
      "So the two of them spoke,\n",
      "360\n",
      "and now made their way to Laërtēs’ fine house; and when\n",
      "they reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, there they found\n",
      "Tēlemachos and the cowherd and the swineherd\n",
      "carving plentiful meat up and mixing the bright wine.\n",
      "Now great-hearted Laërtēs was bathed there in his house\n",
      "365\n",
      "by the Sikel servant. She rubbed him down with oil,\n",
      "and dressed him in a fine mantle; and Athēnē stood close,\n",
      "and filled out the limbs of the shepherd of the people\n",
      "and made him of greater stature and sturdier to behold.\n",
      "Out of the bath he came, and his dear son was astonished\n",
      "370\n",
      "to see him look so like the immortal gods; and he spoke,\n",
      "and addressed him with winged words, saying: “My father,\n",
      "it must be that one of the gods who are forever\n",
      "has improved your looks, made you taller and more handsome!”\n",
      "Then sagacious Laërtēs responded to him, saying:\n",
      "375\n",
      "“How I wish, by Zeus the Father, by Athēnē and Apollō,\n",
      "that—as strong as I was when, as lord of the Kephallēnians,\n",
      "I took Nērikos’ well-built citadel, on the mainland cape—\n",
      "in our domain yesterday, my armor about my shoulders,\n",
      "standing beside you I’d helped to beat back those men,\n",
      "380\n",
      "the suitors! Then indeed I’d have unstrung the knees of many\n",
      "there in your halls: the sight would have gladdened your heart.”\n",
      "Such was the conversation between them, When the others\n",
      "had finished their work, and the meal was made and ready,\n",
      "they sat down in order on the benches and chairs. As they\n",
      "385\n",
      "were reaching their hands to the food, there now came in\n",
      "the elderly Dolios, and with him the old man’s sons,\n",
      "all tired from their field work: their mother, old Sikel servant,\n",
      "had gone out and called them in, she who’d brought them up,\n",
      "and took good care of Laërtēs, now great age was on him.\n",
      "390\n",
      "They, when they saw Odysseus, and realized who he was,\n",
      "stood still, in dumbstruck amazement. But Odysseus\n",
      "in conciliatory language now addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Old man, sit you down to dinner, and you others, give over\n",
      "your wonder—we wanted to start on the food, but we’ve\n",
      "395\n",
      "been waiting a while, expecting you any moment.”\n",
      "So he spoke; but Dolios made straight for him, with both\n",
      "arms outstretched, caught and kissed Odysseus’ hand at the wrist,\n",
      "then addressed him with winged words, saying: “Dear master,\n",
      "you’re back! We missed you so much, we never thought\n",
      "400\n",
      "we’d see you again! The gods themselves brought you here!\n",
      "Good health to you, a warm welcome, may the gods bless you!\n",
      "Oh, and tell me this truly, I want to be quite certain:\n",
      "Does prudent Penelopē already know for sure\n",
      "that you’re back home, or shall we send her a messenger?”\n",
      "405\n",
      "Resourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n",
      "“She already knows, old man: what need for you to do this?”\n",
      "So he spoke. Dolios sat down again6 on his polished chair.\n",
      "In the same way, his sons now gathered round famous Odysseus\n",
      "made him welcoming speeches and clasped his hands in theirs,\n",
      "410\n",
      "and then sat down in order beside their father, Dolios.\n",
      "While they busied themselves with dinner, there in the hall,\n",
      "Rumor the messenger sped through the city’s every quarter,\n",
      "reporting the hideous death and fate of the suitors. Those\n",
      "who heard it now hurriedly gathered from all directions,\n",
      "415\n",
      "sobbing and wailing, there in front of Odysseus’ domain.\n",
      "Out from it each of them fetched their own dead for burial,\n",
      "and all those from other cities they now sent homeward,\n",
      "in the charge of seamen aboard swift ships; they themselves\n",
      "went, grieving at heart, in a body to the place of assembly.\n",
      "420\n",
      "Then, when they were all assembled and met together,\n",
      "Eupeithēs stood up and addressed them, incurable sorrow\n",
      "a great weight on his heart on account of his own son,\n",
      "Antinoös, the first man that noble Odysseus had slain.\n",
      "Shedding tears for him, he now addressed the assembly, saying:\n",
      "425\n",
      "“A foul act it was, my friends, that this man committed\n",
      "against the Achaians! Many fine men he took in his ships,\n",
      "and the hollow ships he lost, and the men all perished;\n",
      "and others, the best of the Kephallēnians, he slaughtered\n",
      "on his return. So come, before he runs away to Pylos\n",
      "430\n",
      "or sacred Ēlis, where the Epeians hold sway,\n",
      "let’s get going, or hereafter we shall be disgraced forever:\n",
      "this matter will be a reproach for men yet unborn to hear of\n",
      "unless we’re revenged on the killers of our sons and brothers!\n",
      "For me there would certainly be no pleasure in clinging\n",
      "435\n",
      "to life—I’d rather die now, join the departed shades!\n",
      "So lets get going, before they cross the sea and escape us.”\n",
      "So he spoke, shedding tears. Pity seized on all the Achaians.\n",
      "Then they were joined by Medōn and the godlike minstrel\n",
      "from Odysseus’ domain, for sleep had now let them go.\n",
      "440\n",
      "They stood there among them: amazement gripped every man.\n",
      "Then Medōn, thoughtful and sensible, addressed them, saying:\n",
      "“Hear me out now, men of Ithákē! Odysseus did not\n",
      "perform these deeds without the immortal gods’ support!\n",
      "I myself saw a deathless god, who stood beside him,\n",
      "445\n",
      "in all ways resembling Mentōr, yet as an immortal\n",
      "god he appeared there, in front of Odysseus, now\n",
      "encouraging him; now again, alarming the suitors\n",
      "he’d storm through the hall, and they fell thick and fast.”\n",
      "So he spoke, and pale fear now seized upon them all.\n",
      "450\n",
      "Then among them there spoke the aged hero Halithersēs,\n",
      "son of Mastōr: he alone saw both before and after.\n",
      "He with friendly intent now addressed the assembly, saying:\n",
      "“Give a hearing, you men of Ithákē, to what I shall tell you!\n",
      "It’s your own fault, my friends, that all these actions happened!\n",
      "455\n",
      "You wouldn’t listen to me or to Mentōr, the people’s shepherd,\n",
      "and make your sons give over their mindless stupidity!\n",
      "In their criminal folly they perpetrated a monstrous wrong,\n",
      "squandering the possessions and insulting the bedfellow\n",
      "of a most noble man, saying he would never return.\n",
      "460\n",
      "Let it be this way, then, and do as I tell you: we should not\n",
      "strike back—he that does might bring trouble upon himself.”\n",
      "So he spoke. More than half of them now sprang to their feet\n",
      "in a great uproar—the rest stayed together where they were,—\n",
      "for this speech aroused their displeasure, they were convinced\n",
      "465\n",
      "by Eupeithēs, so that now they rushed off for their armor,\n",
      "and when they’d clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze,\n",
      "they assembled then in a body in front of the spacious town,\n",
      "with Eupeithēs in his folly leading them: he imagined\n",
      "he was going to avenge his son’s murder. He was not destined\n",
      "470\n",
      "to come back himself, but rather to meet his fate there.\n",
      "Athēnē now spoke to Zeus, the son of Kronos, saying:\n",
      "“Son of Kronos, our Father, supreme above all rulers,\n",
      "will you answer my questions? What’s your mind now hiding?\n",
      "Will you promote further warfare and the vile din of battle,\n",
      "475\n",
      "or rather make friendship between the opposing sides?”\n",
      "Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer responded to her, saying:\n",
      "“My child, why ask me questions about these matters?\n",
      "Was it not you yourself who thought up this whole plan,\n",
      "for Odysseus to come home and be revenged on these men?\n",
      "480\n",
      "So, do as you please—but I’ll tell you what’s fitting. Now\n",
      "that noble Odysseus has worked his vengeance on the suitors,\n",
      "they must swear a solemn oath: let him be king for life,\n",
      "while as to the killing of their sons and brothers, let us\n",
      "enforce a forgetting of it. Let them, as previously,\n",
      "485\n",
      "be friends with each other; let wealth and peace abound.”\n",
      "So saying, he roused Athēnē, who was eager already, and she\n",
      "went on her way, darting down from Olympos’ heights.\n",
      "When his group had assuaged their desire for mind-honeying food,\n",
      "much-enduring noble Odysseus quickly spoke to them, saying:\n",
      "490\n",
      "“Someone has to go out and see how near they’re getting.”\n",
      "So he spoke. One of Dolios’ sons now went out, as he ordered,\n",
      "stood at the threshold and saw them, all close at hand,\n",
      "and at once addressed Odysseus with winged words, saying:\n",
      "“It’s them, they’re close! We need to arm ourselves at once!”\n",
      "495\n",
      "So he spoke; they stood up and donned their armor. Odysseus\n",
      "and his men were four, with the six sons of Dolios, while\n",
      "Laërtēs, and Dolios too, both armed themselves as well,\n",
      "grey-haired though they were, now forced to be warriors.\n",
      "Then, when they’d clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze,\n",
      "500\n",
      "they opened the doors and went out. Odysseus led them.\n",
      "Athēnē, daughter of Zeus, now joined their company,\n",
      "likening herself to Mentōr in both voice and appearance.\n",
      "Much-enduring noble Odysseus rejoiced at he sight of her,\n",
      "and at once he addressed his dear son Tēlemachos, saying:\n",
      "505\n",
      "“Tēlemachos, you’ll now learn for yourself—having come\n",
      "where battle picks out the truly best men fighting—\n",
      "not in any way to disgrace your fathers’ ancestors, who\n",
      "long ago excelled the world over in manly strength and valor.”\n",
      "Sagacious Tēlemachos responded to him, saying:\n",
      "510\n",
      "“You’ll see me, if you so wish, dear father—such is my spirit—\n",
      "in no way, as you say, disgracing your ancestry.”\n",
      "So he spoke. Laërtēs was glad, and made this declaration:\n",
      "“What a great day for me, you kind gods! I’ve joy past measure!\n",
      "Here are my son and my grandson contending over valor!”\n",
      "515\n",
      "Grey-eyed Athēnē now came up and addressed him, saying:\n",
      "“Ah, son of Arkeisios, of all my friends the dearest,\n",
      "pray first to the grey-eyed maiden and to Zeus her father,\n",
      "then at once whirl up your far-shadowing spear and throw it!”\n",
      "So spoke Pallas Athēnē, and breathed great strength into him.\n",
      "520\n",
      "He made his prayer to Pallas Athēnē, and at once\n",
      "whirled up his far-shadowing spear, and threw it, and struck\n",
      "Eupeithēs through the bronze cheek piece of his helmet,\n",
      "which did not hold up the spear: the bronze passed through,\n",
      "and he fell with a thud, and his war gear clattered on him.\n",
      "525\n",
      "Then on their front rank fell Odysseus and his illustrious son,\n",
      "striking at them with swords and twin-edged spears.\n",
      "And now they’d have killed them all, cut them off from home,\n",
      "had not Athēnē, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus,\n",
      "shouted aloud, and stopped dead all the combatants, saying:\n",
      "530\n",
      "“Cease this disastrous warfare, you men of Ithákē,\n",
      "so you may part the sooner, and without bloodshed.”\n",
      "So spoke Athēnē, and pale fear now seized upon them.\n",
      "In their abject terror the arms now flew from their hands\n",
      "and dropped to the ground as the goddess uttered these words,\n",
      "535\n",
      "and they turned toward the city, longing to save their lives.\n",
      "Much-enduring noble Odysseus now gave a fearsome shout,\n",
      "and gathered himself and swooped like some high-flying eagle;\n",
      "but then Kronos’ son flung down a smoldering bolt, which landed\n",
      "right in front of the grey-eyed child of the mighty Father. At this\n",
      "540\n",
      "she, grey-eyed Athēnē, addressed Odysseus, saying:\n",
      "“Scion of Zeus, Laërtēs’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\n",

      "or Kronos’ son, far-seeing Zeus, may get angry with you.”\n",

      "545\n",
      "treaty for time to come was now made between both sides\n",
