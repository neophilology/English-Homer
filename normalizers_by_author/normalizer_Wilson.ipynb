       "'Tell me about a complicated man.\\nMuse, tell me how he wandered and was lost\\nwhen he had wrecked the holy town of Troy,\\nand where he went, and who he met, the pain\\nhe suﬀered in the storms at sea, and how\\nhe worked to save his life and bring his men\\nback home. He failed to keep them safe; poor fools,\\nthey ate the Sun God’s cattle, and the god\\nkept them from home. Now goddess, child of Zeus,\\ntell the old story for our modern times. \\nFind the beginning.\\nAll the other Greeks\\nwho had survived the brutal sack of Troy\\nsailed safely home to their own wives—except\\nthis man alone. Calypso, a great goddess,\\nhad trapped him in her cave; she wanted him\\nto be her husband. When the year rolled round\\nin which the gods decreed he should go home\\nto Ithaca, his troubles still went on.\\nThe man was friendless. All the gods took pity,\\nexcept Poseidon’s anger never ended \\nuntil Odysseus was back at home.\\nBut now the distant Ethiopians,\\nwho live between the sunset and the dawn,\\nwere worshipping the Sea God with a feast,\\na hundred cattle and a hundred rams.\\nThere sat the god, delighting in his banquet.\\nThe other gods were gathered on Olympus,\\nin Father Zeus’ palace. He was thinking\\nof fine, well-born Aegisthus, who was killed\\nby Agamemnon’s famous son Orestes. \\nHe told the deathless gods,\\n“This is absurd,\\nthat mortals blame the gods! They say we cause\\ntheir suﬀering, but they themselves increase it\\nby folly. So Aegisthus overstepped:\\nhe took the legal wife of Agamemnon,\\nthen killed the husband when he came back home,\\nalthough he knew that it would doom them all.\\nWe gods had warned Aegisthus; we sent down\\nperceptive Hermes, who flashed into sight\\nand told him not to murder Agamemnon \\nor court his wife, Orestes would grow up\\nand come back to his home to take revenge.\\nAegisthus would not hear that good advice.\\nBut now his death has paid all debts.”\\nAthena\\nlooked at him steadily and answered, “Father,\\nhe did deserve to die. Bring death to all\\nwho act like him! But I am agonizing\\nabout Odysseus and his bad luck.\\nFor too long he has suﬀered, with no friends,\\nsea all around him, sea on every side, \\nout on an island where a goddess lives,\\ndaughter of fearful Atlas, who holds up\\nthe pillars of the sea, and knows its depths—\\nthose pillars keep the heaven and earth apart.\\nHis daughter holds that poor unhappy man,\\nand tries beguiling him with gentle words\\nto cease all thoughts of Ithaca; but he\\nlongs to see even just the smoke that rises\\nfrom his own homeland, and he wants to die.\\nYou do not even care, Olympian! \\nRemember how he sacrificed to you\\non the broad plain of Troy beside his ships?\\nSo why do you dismiss Odysseus?”\\n“Daughter!” the Cloud God said, “You must be joking,\\nsince how could I forget Odysseus?\\nHe is more sensible than other humans,\\nand makes more sacrifices to the gods.\\nBut Lord Poseidon rages, unrelenting,\\nbecause Odysseus destroyed the eye\\nof godlike Polyphemus, his own son, \\nthe strongest of the Cyclopes—whose mother,\\nThoosa, is a sea-nymph, child of Phorcys,\\nthe sea king; and she lay beside Poseidon\\ninside a hollow cave. So now Poseidon\\nprevents Odysseus from reaching home\\nbut does not kill him. Come then, we must plan:\\nhow can he get back home? Poseidon must\\ngive up his anger, since he cannot fight\\nalone against the will of all the gods.”\\nAthena’s eyes lit up and she replied, \\n“Great Father, if the blessed gods at last\\nwill let Odysseus return back home,\\nthen hurry, we must send our messenger,\\nHermes the giant-slayer. He must swoop\\ndown to Ogygia right away and tell\\nthe beautiful Calypso we have formed\\na firm decision that Odysseus\\nhas waited long enough. He must go home.\\nAnd I will go to Ithaca to rouse\\nthe courage of his son, and make him call \\na meeting, and speak out against the suitors\\nwho kill his flocks of sheep and longhorn cattle\\nunstoppably. Then I will send him oﬀ\\nto Pylos and to Sparta, to seek news\\nabout his father’s journey home, and gain\\na noble reputation for himself.”\\nWith that, she tied her sandals on her feet,\\nthe marvelous golden sandals that she wears\\nto travel sea and land, as fast as wind.\\nShe took the heavy bronze-tipped spear she uses \\nto tame the ranks of warriors with whom\\nshe is enraged. Then from the mountain down\\nshe sped to Ithaca, and stopped outside\\nOdysseus’ court, bronze spear in hand.\\nShe looked like Mentes now, the Taphian leader,\\na guest-friend. There she found the lordly suitors\\nsitting on hides—they killed the cows themselves—\\nand playing checkers. Quick, attentive house slaves\\nwere waiting on them. Some were mixing wine\\nwith water in the bowls, and others brought \\nthe tables out and wiped them oﬀ with sponges,\\nand others carved up heaping plates of meat.\\nTelemachus was sitting with them, feeling\\ndejected. In his mind he saw his father\\ncoming from somewhere, scattering the suitors,\\nand gaining back his honor, and control\\nof all his property. With this in mind,\\nhe was the first to see Athena there.\\nHe disapproved of leaving strangers stranded,\\nso he went straight to meet her at the gate, \\nand shook her hand, and took her spear of bronze,\\nand let his words fly out to her.\\n“Good evening,\\nstranger, and welcome. Be our guest, come share\\nour dinner, and then tell us what you need.”\\nHe led her in, and Pallas followed him.\\nInside the high-roofed hall, he set her spear\\nbeside a pillar in a polished stand,\\nin which Odysseus kept stores of weapons.\\nAnd then he led her to a chair and spread\\na smooth embroidered cloth across the seat, \\nand pulled a footstool up to it. He sat\\nbeside her on a chair of inlaid wood,\\na distance from the suitors, so their shouting\\nwould not upset the stranger during dinner;\\nalso to ask about his absent father.\\nA girl brought washing water in a jug\\nof gold, and poured it on their hands and into\\na silver bowl, and set a table by them.\\nA deferential slave brought bread and laid\\na wide array of food, a generous spread. \\nThe carver set beside them plates of meat\\nof every kind, and gave them golden cups.\\nThe cup boy kept on topping up the wine.\\nThe suitors sauntered in and sat on chairs,\\nobserving proper order, and the slaves\\npoured water on their hands. The house girls brought\\nbaskets of bread and heaped it up beside them,\\nand house boys filled their wine-bowls up with drink.\\nThey reached to take the good things set before them.\\nOnce they were satisfied with food and drink, \\nthe suitors turned their minds to other things—\\nsinging and dancing, glories of the feast.\\nA slave brought out a well-tuned lyre and gave it\\nto Phemius, the man the suitors forced\\nto sing for them. He struck the chords to start\\nhis lovely song.\\nTelemachus leaned in\\nclose to Athena, so they would not hear,\\nand said,\\n“Dear guest—excuse my saying this—\\nthese men are only interested in music—\\na life of ease. They make no contribution. \\nThis food belongs to someone else, a man\\nwhose white bones may be lying in the rain\\nor sunk beneath the waves. If they saw him\\nreturn to Ithaca, they would all pray\\nfor faster feet, instead of wealth and gold\\nand fancy clothes. In fact, he must have died.\\nWe have no hope. He will not come back home.\\nIf someone says so, we do not believe it.\\nBut come now, tell me this and tell the truth.\\nWho are you? From what city, and what parents? \\nWhat kind of ship did you here arrive on?\\nWhat sailors brought you here, and by what route?\\nYou surely did not travel here on foot!\\nHere is the thing I really want to know:\\nhave you been here before? Are you a friend\\nwho visited my father? Many men\\ncame to his house. He traveled many places.”\\nAthena’s clear bright eyes met his. She said,\\n“Yes, I will tell you everything. I am\\nMentes, the son of wise Anchialus, \\nlord of the Taphians, who love the oar.\\nI traveled with my ship and my companions\\nover the wine-dark sea to foreign lands,\\nwith iron that I hope to trade for copper\\nin Temese. My ship is in the harbor\\nfar from the town, beneath the woody hill.\\nAnd you and I are guest-friends through our fathers,\\nfrom long ago—Laertes can confirm it.\\nI hear that fine old man no longer comes\\nto town, but lives out in the countryside, \\nstricken by grief, with only one old slave,\\nwho gives him food and drink when he trails back\\nleg-weary from his orchard, rich in vines.\\nI came because they told me that your father\\nwas here—but now it seems that gods have blocked\\nhis path back home. But I am sure that he\\nis not yet dead. The wide sea keeps him trapped\\nupon some island, captured by fierce men\\nwho will not let him go. Now I will make\\na prophecy the gods have given me, \\nand I think it will all come true, although\\nI am no prophet. He will not be gone\\nmuch longer from his own dear native land,\\neven if chains of iron hold him fast.\\nHe will devise a means of getting home.\\nHe is resourceful. Tell me now—are you\\nOdysseus’ son? You are so tall!\\nYour handsome face and eyes resemble his.\\nWe often met and knew each other well,\\nbefore he went to Troy, where all the best \\nleaders of Argos sailed in hollow ships.\\nFrom that time on, we have not seen each other.”\\nTelemachus was careful as he answered.\\n“Dear guest, I will be frank with you. My mother\\nsays that I am his son, but I cannot\\nbe sure, since no one knows his own begetting.\\nI wish I were the son of someone lucky,\\nwho could grow old at home with all his wealth.\\nInstead, the most unlucky man alive\\nis said to be my father—since you ask.” \\nAthena looked at him with sparkling eyes.\\n“Son of Penelope, you and your sons\\nwill make a name in history, since you are\\nso clever. But now tell me this. Who are\\nthese banqueters? And what is the occasion?\\nA drinking party, or a wedding feast?\\nThey look so arrogant and self-indulgent,\\nmaking themselves at home. A wise observer\\nwould surely disapprove of how they act.”\\nTelemachus said moodily, “My friend, \\nsince you have raised the subject, there was once\\na time when this house here was doing well,\\nour future bright, when he was still at home.\\nBut now the gods have changed their plans and cursed\\nus,\\nand cast my father into utter darkness.\\nIf he had died it would not be this bad—\\nif he had fallen with his friends at Troy,\\nor in his loved ones’ arms, when he had wound\\nthe threads of war to end. The Greeks would then\\nhave built a tomb for him; he would have won \\nfame for his son. But now, the winds have seized him,\\nand he is nameless and unknown. He left\\nnothing but tears for me. I do not weep\\nonly for him. The gods have given me\\nso many other troubles. All the chiefs\\nof Same, Zacynthus, Dulichium,\\nand local lords, from rocky Ithaca,\\nare courting Mother, wasting our whole house.\\nShe does not turn these awful suitors down,\\nnor can she end the courting. They keep eating, \\nspoiling my house—and soon, they will kill me!”\\nAthena said in outrage, “This is monstrous!\\nYou need Odysseus to come back home\\nand lay his hands on all those shameless suitors!\\nIf only he would come here now and stand\\nright at the gates, with two spears in his hands,\\nin shield and helmet, as when I first saw him!\\nOdysseus was visiting our house,\\ndrinking and having fun on his way back\\nfrom sailing in swift ships to Ephyra \\nto visit Ilus. He had gone there looking\\nfor deadly poison to anoint his arrows.\\nIlus refused, because he feared the gods.\\nMy father gave Odysseus the poison,\\nloving him blindly. May Odysseus\\ncome meet the suitors with that urge to kill!\\nA bitter courtship and short life for them!\\nBut whether he comes home to take revenge,\\nor not, is with the gods. You must consider\\nhow best to drive these suitors from your house. \\nCome, listen carefully to what I say.\\nTomorrow call the Achaean chiefs to meeting,\\nand tell the suitors—let the gods be witness—\\n‘All of you, go away! To your own homes!’\\nAs for your mother, if she wants to marry,\\nlet her return to her great father’s home.\\nThey will make her a wedding and prepare\\nabundant gifts to show her father’s love.\\nNow here is some advice from me for you.\\nFit out a ship with twenty oars, the best, \\nand go find out about your long-lost father.\\nSomeone may tell you news, or you may hear\\na voice from Zeus, best source of information.\\nFirst go to Pylos, question godlike Nestor;\\nfrom there, to Sparta; visit Menelaus.\\nHe came home last of all the Achaean heroes.\\nIf you should hear that he is still alive\\nand coming home, put up with this abuse\\nfor one more year. But if you hear that he\\nis dead, go home, and build a tomb for him, \\nand hold a lavish funeral to show\\nthe honor he deserves, and give your mother\\nin marriage to a man. When this is done,\\nconsider deeply how you might be able\\nto kill the suitors in your halls—by tricks\\nor openly. You must not stick to childhood;\\nyou are no longer just a little boy.\\nYou surely heard how everybody praised\\nOrestes when he killed the man who killed\\nhis famous father—devious Aegisthus? \\nDear boy, I see how big and tall you are.\\nBe brave, and win yourself a lasting name.\\nBut I must go now, on my speedy ship;\\nmy friends are getting tired of waiting for me.\\nRemember what I said and heed my words.”\\nTelemachus was brooding on her words,\\nand said, “Dear guest, you were so kind to give me\\nthis fatherly advice. I will remember.\\nI know that you are eager to be oﬀ,\\nbut please enjoy a bath before you go, \\nand take a gift with you. I want to give you\\na precious, pretty treasure as a keepsake\\nto mark our special friendship.”\\nBut the goddess\\nAthena met his gaze and said, “Do not\\nhold me back now. I must be on my way.\\nAs for the gift you feel inspired to give me,\\nsave it for when I come on my way home\\nand let me give you presents then as well\\nin fair exchange.”\\nWith that, the owl-eyed goddess\\nflew away like a bird, up through the smoke. \\nShe left him feeling braver, more determined,\\nand with his father even more in mind.\\nWatching her go, he was amazed and saw\\nshe was a god. Then godlike, he went oﬀ\\nto meet the suitors.\\nThey were sitting calmly,\\nlistening to the poet, who sang how\\nAthena cursed the journey of the Greeks\\nas they were sailing home from Troy. Upstairs,\\nPenelope had heard the marvelous song.\\nShe clambered down the steep steps of her house, \\nnot by herself—two slave girls came with her.\\nShe reached the suitors looking like a goddess,\\nthen stopped and stood beside a sturdy pillar,\\nholding a gauzy veil before her face.\\nHer slave girls stood, one on each side of her.\\nIn tears, she told the holy singer,\\n“Stop,\\nplease Phemius! You know so many songs,\\nenchanting tales of things that gods and men\\nhave done, the deeds that singers publicize.\\nSing something else, and let them drink in peace. \\nStop this upsetting song that always breaks\\nmy heart, so I can hardly bear my grief.\\nI miss him all the time—that man, my husband,\\nwhose story is so famous throughout Greece.”\\nSullen Telemachus said, “Mother, no,\\nyou must not criticize the loyal bard\\nfor singing as it pleases him to sing.\\nPoets are not to blame for how things are;\\nZeus is; he gives to each as is his will.\\nDo not blame Phemius because he told \\nabout the Greek disasters. You must know\\nthe newest song is always praised the most.\\nSo steel your heart and listen to the song.\\nOdysseus was not the only one\\nwho did not come back home again from Troy.\\nMany were lost. Go in and do your work.\\nStick to the loom and distaﬀ. Tell your slaves\\nto do their chores as well. It is for men\\nto talk, especially me. I am the master.”\\nThat startled her. She went back to her room, \\nand took her son’s uneasy words to heart.\\nShe went upstairs, along with both her slaves,\\nand wept there for her dear Odysseus,\\nuntil Athena gave her eyes sweet sleep.\\nThroughout the shadowy hall the suitors clamored,\\npraying to lie beside her in her bed.\\nTelemachus inhaled, then started speaking.\\n“You suitors, you are taking this too far.\\nLet us enjoy the feast in peace. It is\\na lovely thing to listen to a bard, \\nespecially one with such a godlike voice.\\nAt dawn, let us assemble in the square.\\nI have to tell you this—it is an order.\\nYou have to leave my halls. Go dine elsewhere!\\nEat your own food, or share between your houses.\\nOr if you think it easier and better\\nto ruin one man’s wealth, and if you think\\nthat you can get away with it—go on!\\nI call upon the gods; Zeus will grant vengeance.\\nYou will be punished and destroyed, right here!” \\nHe spoke, and they began to bite their lips,\\nshocked that Telemachus would dare to speak\\nso boldly. But Antinous replied,\\n“Telemachus, the gods themselves have taught you\\nsuch pride, to talk so big and brash in public!\\nMay Zeus the son of Cronus never grant you\\nyour true inheritance, which is the throne\\nof Ithaca.”\\nHis mind alert and focused,\\nTelemachus replied, “Antinous,\\nyou will not like this, but I have to say, \\nI hope Zeus does give me the throne. Do you\\ndeny it is an honorable thing\\nto be a king? It brings the household wealth,\\nand honor to the man. But there are many\\nother great chiefs in sea-girt Ithaca,\\nboth old and young. I know that. One of them\\nmay seize the throne, now that Odysseus\\nhas died. But I shall be at least the lord\\nof my own house and of the slaves that he\\nseized for my benefit.”\\nEurymachus \\nreplied, “Telemachus, the gods must choose\\nwhich of us will be king of Ithaca.\\nBut still, I hope you keep your own possessions,\\nand rule your house. May no man drive you out,\\nand seize your wealth, while Ithaca survives.\\nNow, friend, I want to ask about the stranger.\\nWhere was he from, what country? Did he say?\\nWhere is his place of birth, his native soil?\\nDoes he bring news your father will come home?\\nOr did he come here for some other purpose? \\nHow suddenly he darted oﬀ, not waiting\\nfor us to meet him. Yet he looked important.”\\nThe boy said soberly, “Eurymachus,\\nmy father is not ever coming home.\\nI do not listen now to any gossip,\\nor forecasts from the psychics whom my mother\\ninvites to visit us. The stranger was\\nmy father’s guest-friend Mentes, son of wise\\nAnchialus, who rules the Taphians,\\nthe people of the oar.”\\nThose were his words, \\nbut in his mind he knew she was a god.\\nThey danced to music and enjoyed themselves\\ntill evening, then they went back home to sleep.\\nTelemachus’ bedroom had been built\\nabove the courtyard, so it had a view.\\nHe went upstairs, preoccupied by thought.\\nA loyal slave went with him, Eurycleia,\\ndaughter of Ops; she brought the burning torches.\\nLaertes bought her many years before\\nwhen she was very young, for twenty oxen. \\nHe gave her status in the household, equal\\nto his own wife, but never slept with her,\\navoiding bitter feelings in his marriage.\\nShe brought the torches now; she was the slave\\nwho loved him most, since she had cared for him\\nwhen he was tiny. Entering the room,\\nhe sat down on the bed, took oﬀ his tunic,\\nand gave it to the vigilant old woman.\\nShe smoothed it out and folded it, then hung it\\nup on a hook beside his wooden bed, \\nand left the room. She used the silver latch\\nto close the door; the strap pulled tight the bolt.\\nHe slept the night there, wrapped in woolen blankets,\\nplanning the journey told him by Athena.\\nBOOK \\nA Dangerous Journey\\nThe early Dawn was born; her fingers bloomed.\\nOdysseus’ well-beloved son\\njumped up, put on his clothes, and strapped his sword\\nacross his back, and tied his handsome sandals\\nonto his well-oiled feet. He left the room\\nlooking just like a god.\\nHe quickly told\\nthe clear-voiced heralds they must call the Greeks\\nto council. Soon the men, their long hair flowing,\\nwere gathered all together in the square.\\nTelemachus arrived, bronze sword in hand, \\nnot by himself—two swift dogs came with him.\\nAthena poured a heavenly grace upon him.\\nThe elders let him join them, and he sat\\nupon his father’s throne. The first to speak\\nwas wise Aegyptius, a bent old soldier.\\nHis darling son, the spear-man Antiphus,\\nhad sailed with Lord Odysseus to Troy;\\nthe Cyclops killed him in his cave and made him\\nhis final course at dinner. This old father\\nhad three sons left. One teamed up with the suitors— \\nEurynomus. The others spent their time\\nworking the farm. But still the father mourned\\nthe son whom he had lost. He spoke in tears.\\n“People of Ithaca, now hear my words.\\nWe have not met in council since the day\\nOdysseus departed with his ships.\\nWho called us? Someone old or young? And why?\\nHas he found out an army is approaching?\\nOr does he have some other piece of news\\nwhich he would like to share with all of us? \\nI think he is a helpful, decent man.\\nI hope that Zeus rewards his good intentions!”\\nOdysseus’ loving son felt glad,\\nand eagerly got up to speak and stood\\namong them, in the center of the group.\\nThe competent oﬃcial, named Pisenor,\\npassed him the speaking-stick; he held it up,\\nand first addressed Aegyptius.\\n“Here, sir!\\nNow look no further for the man you seek.\\nI called the meeting. I am in deep trouble. \\nI have no information of an army\\nthat might attack us, nor do I have news\\nof any other danger to our people.\\nI need help for myself. My family\\nhas suﬀered two disasters. First I lost\\nmy father, who was kind to you as if\\nyou also were his sons. Now, even worse,\\nmy house is being ripped apart; my wealth\\nwill soon be gone! The sons of all the nobles\\nhave shoved inside my house to court my mother, \\nagainst her wishes. They should go and ask\\nIcarius her father to provide\\na dowry, and choose who should be her husband.\\nThey are too scared. Instead, they haunt our house\\nday after day, and kill our cows and pigs\\nand good fat goats. They feast and drink red wine,\\nnot caring if they waste it all. There is\\nno man to save the house—no man like him,\\nOdysseus. I cannot fight against them;\\nI would be useless. I have had no training. \\nBut if I had the power, I would do it!\\nIt is unbearable, what they have done!\\nThey ruined my whole house! It is not fair!\\nYou suitors all should feel ashamed! Consider\\nwhat others in the neighborhood will think!\\nAnd also be afraid! The angry gods\\nwill turn on you in rage; they will be shocked\\nat all this criminal behavior!\\nI beg you, by Olympian Zeus, and by\\nthe goddess who presides in human meetings: \\nJustice! But never mind. Friends, leave me be,\\nand let me cry and suﬀer by myself.\\nOr did Odysseus, my warlike father,\\ndeliberately do harm to our own side?\\nIs that why you seem set on hurting me,\\nencouraging these suitors? Oh, if only\\nyou Ithacans would eat my stock yourselves!\\nIf you did that, I soon would get revenge;\\nI would come through the town and keep demanding,\\nuntil it all got given back. But now, \\nyou make me so unhappy! This is pointless!”\\nHe stopped, frustrated, flung the scepter down,\\nand burst out crying. Everyone was seized\\nby pity. No one spoke; they hesitated\\nto answer him unkindly. Then at last\\nAntinous began.\\n“Telemachus,\\nyou stuck-up, wilful little boy! How dare you\\ntry to embarrass us and put the blame\\non us? We suitors have not done you wrong.\\nGo blame your precious mother! She is cunning. \\nIt is the third year, soon it will be four,\\nthat she has cheated us of what we want.\\nShe oﬀers hope to all, sends notes to each,\\nbut all the while her mind moves somewhere else.\\nShe came up with a special trick: she fixed\\na mighty loom inside the palace hall.\\nWeaving her fine long cloth, she said to us,\\n‘Young men, you are my suitors. Since my husband,\\nthe brave Odysseus, is dead, I know\\nyou want to marry me. You must be patient; \\nI have worked hard to weave this winding-sheet\\nto bury good Laertes when he dies.\\nHe gained such wealth, the women would reproach me\\nif he were buried with no shroud. Please let me\\nfinish it!’ And her words made sense to us.\\nSo every day she wove the mighty cloth,\\nand then at night by torchlight, she unwove it.\\nFor three long years her trick beguiled the Greeks.\\nBut when the fourth year’s seasons rolled around,\\na woman slave who knew the truth told us. \\nWe caught her there, unraveling the cloth,\\nand made her finish it. This is our answer,\\nso you and all the Greeks may understand.\\nDismiss your mother, let her father tell her\\nto marry anyone his heart desires.\\nAthena blessed her with intelligence,\\ngreat artistry and skill, a finer mind\\nthan anyone has ever had before,\\neven the braided girls of ancient Greece,\\nTyro, Alcmene, garlanded Mycene— \\nnone of them had Penelope’s understanding.\\nBut if she wants to go on hurting us,\\nher plans are contrary to destiny.\\nWe suitors will keep eating up your wealth,\\nand livelihood, as long as she pursues\\nthis plan the gods have put inside her heart.\\nFor her it may be glory, but for you,\\npure loss. We will not go back to our farms\\nor anywhere, until she picks a husband.”\\nTelemachus insisted, breathing hard, \\n“Antinous, I cannot force my mother\\nout of the house. She gave me birth and raised me.\\nMy father is elsewhere—alive or dead.\\nIf I insist my mother has to leave,\\nIcarius will make me pay the price,\\nand gods will send more trouble; if she goes,\\nMother will rouse up Furies full of hate\\nto take revenge, and everyone will curse me.\\nI will not. If you feel upset, you go!\\nOut of my house! Stop eating all my food! \\nDevour each other’s property, not mine!\\nOr do you really think it right to waste\\none person’s means of life, and go scot-free?\\nThen try it! I will call the deathless gods!\\nMay Zeus give recompense some day for this!\\nYou will die here, and nobody will care!”\\nThen Zeus, whose voice resounds around the world,\\nsent down two eagles from the mountain peak.\\nAt first they hovered on the breath of wind,\\nclose by each other, balanced on their wings. \\nReaching the noisy middle of the crowd,\\nthey wheeled and whirred and flapped their mighty\\nwings,\\nswooping at each man’s head with eyes like death,\\nand with their talons ripped each face and neck.\\nThen to the right they flew, across the town.\\nEveryone was astonished at the sight;\\nthey wondered in their hearts what this could mean.\\nOld Halitherses, son of Mastor, spoke.\\nMore than the other elders, this old leader\\nexcelled at prophecy and knew the birds. \\nHe gave them good advice.\\n“Now Ithacans,\\nlisten! I speak especially for the suitors.\\nDisaster rolls their way! Odysseus\\nwill not be absent from his friends for long;\\nalready he is near and sows the seeds\\nof death for all of them, and more disaster\\nfor many others in bright Ithaca.\\nWe have to form a plan to make them stop.\\nThat would be best for them as well by far.\\nI am experienced at prophecy; \\nmy words came true for him, that mastermind,\\nOdysseus. I told him when he left\\nfor Troy with all the Argives, he would suﬀer\\nmost terribly, and all his men would die,\\nbut in the twentieth year he would come home,\\nunrecognized. Now it is coming true.”\\nEurymachus, the son of Polybus,\\nreplied, “Old man, be oﬀ! Go home and spout\\nyour portents to your children, or it will\\nbe worse for them. But I can read these omens \\nbetter than you can. Many birds go flying\\nin sunlight, and not all are meaningful.\\nOdysseus is dead, away from home.\\nI wish that you had died with him, to stop\\nyour forecasts! You are making this boy angry,\\nhoping that he will give your household gifts.\\nBut let me tell you this, which will come true.\\nYou may know many ancient forms of wisdom,\\nbut if you tease this boy and make him angry,\\nhe will be hurt, and never get to act \\non any of these prophecies of yours.\\nAnd, old man, we will make you pay so much\\nyour heart will break, your pain will cut so deep.\\nI will advise Telemachus myself,\\nin front of everyone, to send his mother\\nback to her father’s family, to fix\\nher wedding, and the gifts a well-loved daughter\\nshould have. Unless he does that, we will never\\ncease from this torturous courtship. We are not\\nafraid of anyone, much less this boy \\nwith his long speeches, nor your pointless portents.\\nThey will not come to pass and they will make you\\nhated. His house will be devoured, and payback\\nwill never come, as long as she frustrates\\nour hopes of marriage. Meanwhile, we will wait\\nin daily hope, competing for the prize,\\nnot seeking other women as our wives.”\\nTelemachus, his mind made up, replied,\\n“All right, Eurymachus, and all of you.\\nI will not talk about this anymore. \\nThe gods and all of you already know.\\nJust let me have a ship and twenty men\\nto make a journey with me, out and back,\\nto Sparta and to sandy Pylos, seeking\\nnews about when my father may come home.\\nI may hear it from somebody, or from\\na voice from Zeus—it often happens so.\\nIf I find out my father is alive\\nand coming home, I will endure this pain\\nfor one more year. But if I hear that he \\nis dead, I will come home to my own land,\\nand build a tomb and hold the funeral rites\\nas he deserves, and I will give my mother\\nto a new husband.”\\nHe sat down, and up\\nstood Mentor. When Odysseus sailed oﬀ,\\nthis was the friend he asked to guard his house\\nand told the slaves to look to him as master.\\nMentor addressed the crowd.\\n“Now Ithacans!\\nListen! This changes everything! Now kings\\nshould never try to judge with righteousness \\nor rule their people gently. Kings should always\\nbe cruel, since the people whom he ruled\\nas kindly as a father, have forgotten\\ntheir King Odysseus. I do not blame\\nthe suitors’ overconfidence, rough ways\\nand violence, in eating up his household;\\nthey risk their lives, supposing that the master\\nwill never come back home. But I do blame\\nyou others, sitting passive, never speaking\\nagainst them, though you far outnumber them.” \\nLeocritus, Euenor’s son, replied,\\n“Mentor, for shame! You must have lost your mind!\\nFool, telling us to stop our banqueting!\\nYou could not fight us; we outnumber you.\\nEven if Ithacan Odysseus\\ncame back and found us feasting in his house,\\nand tried to drive us out, his wife would get\\nno joy of his return, no matter how\\nshe misses him. If he tried fighting solo\\nagainst us, he would die a cruel death. \\nSo what you said was nonsense. Anyway,\\nwe must disperse, and everyone get busy.\\nMentor and Halitherses, since you are\\nold comrades of his father, you can guide\\nTelemachus’ journey. I suspect\\nhe will not manage to go anywhere;\\nhe will just wait in Ithaca for news.”\\nThe crowd broke up; the Ithacans went home;\\nthe suitors, to Odysseus’ house.\\nTelemachus slipped out and at the beach \\nhe dipped his hands in salty gray seawater,\\nand asked Athena,\\n“Goddess, hear my prayer!\\nJust yesterday you came and ordered me\\nto sail the hazy sea and find out news\\nof my long-absent father’s journey home.\\nThe Greeks are wasting everything, especially\\nthese bullying, mean suitors.”\\nThen Athena\\ncame near him with the voice and guise of Mentor,\\nand spoke to him with words that flew like birds.\\n“Telemachus, you will be brave and thoughtful, \\nif your own father’s forcefulness runs through you.\\nHow capable he was, in word and deed!\\nYour journey will succeed, if you are his.\\nIf you are not his son, his true-born son,\\nI doubt you can achieve what you desire.\\nAnd it is rare for sons to be like fathers;\\nonly a few are better, most are worse.\\nBut you will be no coward and no fool.\\nYou do possess your father’s cunning mind,\\nso there is hope you will do all these things. \\nForget about those foolish suitors’ plans.\\nThey have no brains and no morality.\\nThey do not know black doom will kill them all,\\nand some day soon: their death is near at hand.\\nYou will achieve the journey that you seek,\\nsince I will go with you, just like a father.\\nI will equip a good swift ship for you.\\nNow go back home to where those suitors are,\\nand get provisions. Pack them in containers:\\nsome wine in jars, and grain, the strength of men, \\nin sturdy skins. And I will go through town,\\ncalling for volunteers to come with us.\\nThere are a lot of ships in Ithaca,\\nboth new and old. I will select the best one;\\nwe will equip her quickly and sail fast,\\nfar oﬀ across the sea.”\\nSo spoke the goddess,\\ndaughter of Zeus. Telemachus obeyed.\\nHis heart was troubled as he went back home.\\nHe found the arrogant suitors in the hall,\\nskinning some goats and charring hogs for dinner. \\nAntinous began to laugh. He called him,\\nand seized his hand and spoke these words to him.\\n“Telemachus, you are being so pigheaded!\\nWhy not put all your troubles from your heart?\\nCome eat and drink with me, just as before.\\nYou know the Greeks will fix it all for you.\\nThey will select a ship and crew, and soon\\nyou will reach Pylos, where you hope to hear\\nword of your father.”\\nBut the boy was wary,\\nand said, “Antinous, I cannot eat; \\nI have no peace or joy when I am with\\nyou selfish suitors. Is it not enough\\nthat you destroyed my rich inheritance\\nwhen I was just a little boy? But now\\nI have grown bigger, and I got advice\\nfrom other people, and my heart wells up\\nwith courage. I will try to bring down doom\\non your heads here at home or when I go\\nto Pylos. Yes, I really will go there,\\nas passenger, although I do not own \\na ship or have a crew—because of you!”\\nHe snatched his hand away. But as they feasted,\\nthe suitors started mocking him and jeering.\\nWith sneers they said,\\n“Oh no! Telemachus\\nis going to kill us! He will bring supporters\\nfrom Pylos or from Sparta—he is quite\\ndetermined! Or indeed he may be fetching\\nsome lethal poisons from the fertile fields\\nof Ephyra, to mix up in our wine-bowl\\nand kill us all!”\\nAnother proud young man \\nsaid, “Well, who knows, perhaps he will get lost\\nin that curved ship, and die, so far away\\nfrom all his family—just like his father.\\nAnd what a pity that would be for us!\\nThen we would have to share out all his wealth,\\nand give away the house itself to her—\\nhis mother, and the man who marries her.”\\nThe boy went downstairs, to his father’s storeroom,\\nwide and high-roofed, piled high with gold and bronze\\nand clothes in chests and fragrant olive oil. \\nDown there the jars of vintage wine were stored,\\nwhich held the sweet, unmixed and godlike drink,\\nlined in a row against the wall, in case\\nweary Odysseus came home at last.\\nThe double doors were locked and closely fitted.\\nA woman checked the contents, night and day,\\nguarding it all with great intelligence,\\nand that was Eurycleia, child of Ops.\\nHe called her to the chamber and addressed her.\\n“Nanny, please pour sweet wine in jugs for me, \\nthe second best one, not the one you keep\\nfor when the poor unlucky king escapes\\nfrom evil fate and death, and comes back home.\\nFill up twelve jugs with wine for me, and pour me\\nsome twenty pounds of fine-milled barley-groats,\\nall packed in sturdy leather bags. Load up\\nall these provisions secretly. At nightfall,\\nI will come here and get them, when my mother\\nhas gone upstairs to go to sleep. I am\\nleaving for Sparta and for sandy Pylos, \\nto learn about my father’s journey home.”\\nAt that his loving nurse began to wail,\\nand sobbed,\\n“Sweet child! What gave you this idea?\\nWhy do you want to go so far? You are\\nan only child, and dearly loved! The king,\\nOdysseus, is gone, lost, far from home,\\nand they will plot against you when you leave,\\nscheming to murder you and share this wealth.\\nStay with us, we who love you! Do not go\\nsearching for danger out on restless seas!” \\nTelemachus decisively replied,\\n“Nanny, you need not worry. Gods have blessed\\nthis plan. But promise me you will not tell\\nMother, until she notices me gone.\\nSay nothing for twelve days, so she will not\\nstart crying; it would spoil her pretty skin.”\\nAt that the old nurse swore a mighty oath\\nby all the gods that she would keep the secret,\\nand then she drew the wine for him in jars,\\nand poured the barley-groats in well-stitched bags. \\nTelemachus returned to see the suitors.\\nMeanwhile, bright-eyed Athena had a plan.\\nResembling Telemachus, she went\\nall through the city, standing by each man,\\nand urged them to assemble by the ship\\nat night, and asked the son of Phronius,\\nNoemon, for his speedy ship; he promised\\nto give it gladly. Then the sun went down\\nand all the streets grew dark. The goddess dragged\\nthe ship into the water, and she loaded \\nthe necessary tackle for a journey.\\nRight at the beach’s farthest end the goddess\\nstood and assembled good strong men as crew;\\nshe coached each one. Then, eyes ablaze with plans,\\nshe went back to Odysseus’ house,\\nand poured sweet sleep upon the drunken suitors.\\nShe struck them and their cups fell from their hands.\\nDisguised as Mentor both in looks and voice,\\nshe called the boy out from the mighty hall,\\nand looked intently in his face, and said, \\n“Telemachus, your crew of armored men\\nis ready at the oar for your departure.\\nCome on! No time to waste! We must be gone!”\\nSo speaking, Pallas quickly led the boy;\\nhe followed in the footsteps of the goddess.\\nThey went down to the seashore and the ship,\\nand found the long-haired sailors on the beach.\\nInspired and confident, Telemachus\\ncalled out,\\n“My friends! Come on, let us go fetch\\nthe rations; they are ready in the hall. \\nBut quietly—my mother does not know,\\nnor do the other women, except one.”\\nAnd so he led them, and they followed him.\\nThey loaded everything upon the decks;\\nOdysseus’ son instructed them,\\nand then embarked—Athena led the way.\\nShe sat down in the stern, and next to her\\nTelemachus was sitting. Then the crew\\nreleased the ropes and boarded, each at oar.\\nAthena called a favorable wind, \\npure Zephyr whistling on wine-dark sea.\\nTelemachus commanded his companions\\nto seize the rigging; so they did, and raised\\nthe pine-wood mast inside the rounded block,\\nand bound it down with forestays round about,\\nand raised the bright white sails with leather ropes.\\nWind blew the middle sail; the purple wave\\nwas splashing loudly round the moving keel.\\nThe goddess rode the waves and smoothed the way.\\nThe quick black ship held steady, so they fastened \\nthe tackle down, and filled their cups with wine.\\nThey poured libations to the deathless gods,\\nespecially to the bright-eyed child of Zeus.\\nAll through the night till dawn the ship sailed on.\\nBOOK \\nAn Old King Remembers\\nLeaving the Ocean’s streams, the Sun leapt up\\ninto the sky of bronze, to shine his light\\nfor gods and mortals on the fertile earth.\\nTelemachus arrived in Pylos, where\\nthe Pylians were bringing to the beach\\nblack bulls for blue Poseidon, Lord of Earthquakes.\\nThere were nine benches, fifty men on each,\\nand each group had nine bulls to sacrifice.\\nThey burned the thigh-bones for the god, and ate\\nthe innards. Then the Ithacans arrived, \\ntook down their sails, dropped anchor and alighted.\\nThe goddess with the flashing eyes, Athena,\\nfirst led Telemachus onshore, then spoke.\\n“Do not be shy, Telemachus. You sailed\\nover the sea to ask about your father,\\nwhere the earth hides him, what his fate might be.\\nSo hurry now to Nestor, lord of horses.\\nLearn what advice he has in mind for you.\\nSupplicate him yourself, and he will tell you\\nthe truth; he is not one to tell a lie.” \\nTelemachus replied, “But Mentor, how\\ncan I approach and talk to him? I am\\nquite inexperienced at making speeches,\\nand as a young man, I feel awkward talking\\nto elders.”\\nShe looked straight into his eyes,\\nand answered, “You will work out what to do,\\nthrough your own wits and with divine assistance.\\nThe gods have blessed you in your life so far.”\\nSo Pallas spoke and quickly led him on;\\nhe followed in the footsteps of the goddess. \\nThey reached the center of the town, where Nestor\\nwas sitting with his sons and his companions,\\nputting the meat on spits and roasting it\\nfor dinner. When they saw the strangers coming,\\nthey all stood up with open arms to greet them,\\ninviting them to join them. Nestor’s son,\\nPisistratus, shook hands and sat them down,\\nspreading soft fleeces on the sand beside\\nhis father and his brother, Thrasymedes.\\nHe served them giblets and he poured some wine \\ninto a golden cup, and raised a toast\\nto Pallas, child of Zeus the Aegis-Lord.\\n“Now guest, give prayers of thanks to Lord Poseidon,\\nand pour libations for the god. This feast\\nis in his honor; pay him proper dues.\\nThen give the boy the cup of honeyed wine,\\nso he can oﬀer to the deathless gods\\nlibations. Everybody needs the gods.\\nI give the golden chalice to you first,\\nbecause the boy is younger, more my age.” \\nHe put the cup of sweet wine in her hand.\\nAthena was impressed with his good manners,\\nbecause he rightly gave it first to her.\\nAt once she made a heartfelt prayer.\\n“Poseidon!\\nO Shaker of the Earth, do not refuse\\nto grant our prayer; may all these things come true.\\nBring fame to Nestor and his sons, and grant\\ngifts to the Pylians, as recompense\\nfor this fine sacrifice. And may the quest\\nfor which we sailed here in our swift black ship \\nsucceed, and may we come home safe again.”\\nShe made her prayer come true all by herself.\\nShe gave Telemachus the splendid cup\\nwith double handle, and his prayer matched hers.\\nAnd then they cooked the outer parts of meat,\\nand helped themselves to pieces, sharing round\\nthe glorious feast, till they could eat no more.\\nThen first Gerenian Nestor, horse-lord, spoke.\\n“Now that our guests are satisfied with food,\\ntime now to talk to them and ask them questions. \\nStrangers, who are you? Where did you sail from?\\nAre you on business, or just scouting round\\nlike pirates on the sea, who risk their lives\\nto ravage foreign homes?”\\nTelemachus\\nwas thoughtful but not shy. Athena gave him\\nthe confidence deep in his heart to ask\\nabout his absent father, and to gain\\na noble reputation for himself.\\n“Great Nestor, son of Neleus,” he said,\\n“You ask where I am from. I will be frank. \\nI come from Ithaca, beneath Mount Neion,\\nand I am here on private, family business.\\nI came to gather news about my father,\\nlong-suﬀering Odysseus. They say\\nhe fought with you to sack the town of Troy.\\nWe know the place where all the other men\\nwho battled with the Trojans lost their lives.\\nBut Zeus still keeps Odysseus’ fate\\nin darkness; no one knows where he was lost.\\nMaybe some hostile men killed him on land, \\nor he was drowned in Amphitrite’s waves.\\nI beg you, tell me, did you see him die\\nwith your own eyes? Or have you any news\\nabout where he may be? He must be lost.\\nHis mother surely bore him for misfortune.\\nYou need not sweeten what you say, in pity\\nor from embarrassment. Just tell me straight\\nwhat your eyes saw of him, my noble father.\\nIf ever he made promises to you\\nand kept his word at Troy, in times of trouble, \\nremember those times now. Tell me the truth!”\\nGerenian Nestor, horse-lord, answered him,\\n“Dear boy, you call to mind how much we suﬀered,\\nwith strong, unyielding hearts, in distant lands\\nwhen we were sailing over misty seas,\\nled by Achilles on a hunt for spoils,\\nand when we fought around the mighty city\\nof Priam. Our best warriors were killed.\\nAjax lies dead there, and there lies Achilles;\\nthere lies his godlike friend and guide, Patroclus; \\nmy own strong, matchless son lies dead there too,\\nAntilochus, who fought and ran so well.\\nMore pain, more grief—our suﬀerings increased.\\nWho could recount so many, many losses?\\nIf you stayed here five years and kept on asking\\nhow many things the fighters suﬀered there,\\nyou would get bored and go back home again\\nbefore the story ended. Nine long years\\nwe schemed to bring them down, and finally\\nZeus made our plots succeed. Odysseus, \\nyour father, if you really are his son—\\nwell, no one dared to try to equal him\\nin cleverness. That man was always best\\nat every kind of trick. And seeing you,\\nI am amazed at how you talk like him.\\nOne would not think so young a man could do it.\\nWell, back in Troy, Odysseus and I\\nalways agreed in councils, with one mind.\\nWe gave the Argives all the best advice.\\nAfter we conquered Priam’s lofty town, \\na god dispersed the ships of the Achaeans.\\nZeus planned a bitter journey home for us,\\nsince some of us had neither sense nor morals.\\nGray-eyed Athena, daughter of the Thunder,\\nbecame enraged and brought about disaster.\\nShe set the sons of Atreus to fight\\neach other. Hastily, they called the people\\nat sunset, not observing proper norms.\\nThe men arrived already drunk on wine;\\nthe brothers told them why they called the meeting. \\nThen Menelaus said that it was time\\nto sail back home across the open sea.\\nBut Agamemnon disagreed entirely.\\nHe wanted them to stay and sacrifice\\nto heal the sickness of Athena’s wrath—\\npointless! He did not know she would not yield.\\nThe minds of the immortals rarely change.\\nSo those two stood and argued angrily,\\nand with a dreadful clash of arms the Greeks\\nleapt up on two opposing sides. We slept \\nthat eerie night with hearts intent on hatred\\nagainst each other—since Zeus meant us harm.\\nAt dawn one group of us dragged down our ships\\ninto the sea piled high with loot and women,\\nwhile half the army still remained there, stationed\\nwith Agamemnon, shepherd of the people.\\nMy friends and I set sail with all good speed—\\na god had made the choppy sea lie calm.\\nWe came to Tenedos and sacrificed,\\npraying to get back home—but Zeus refused; \\nthe cruel god roused yet more strife among us.\\nYour father’s plans were always flexible:\\nhis men turned round their prows and sailed right back\\nto make their peace again with Agamemnon.\\nBut I assembled all my fleet, and fled—\\nI understood some god must mean us harm.\\nThen Diomedes roused his men to come,\\nand ruddy Menelaus quickly sailed\\nto meet with us on Lesbos, and we pondered\\nour long sea journey. Should we travel north, \\ngo past the rocks of Chios to our left,\\nto Psyria, or under Chios, passing\\nblustery Mimas? So we prayed for signs.\\nThe god told us to cross the open sea\\ntowards Euboea, to escape disaster.\\nA fair wind whistled and our ships sped on\\nacross the journey-ways of fish, and landed\\nat nightfall in Geraestus. To Poseidon\\nwe oﬀered many bulls, since we had crossed\\nsafely across wide waters. The fourth day \\nthe men of Diomedes moored their ships\\nat Argos; I kept going on, to Pylos.\\nThe wind the god had sent kept holding strong\\nthe whole way home. So, my dear boy, I have\\nno news about what happened next. I do not\\nknow which of them has died and who is safe.\\nBut I can tell you what I heard while sitting\\nhere in my halls. You ought to know. They say\\nAchilles’ son led home the Myrmidons,\\nand Philoctetes came back home with glory. \\nAnd Idomeneus led back his crew\\nto Crete; no man of his who had survived\\nthe war was lost at sea. And Agamemnon?\\nYou must have heard, though you live far away.\\nAegisthus murdered him! But he has paid\\na bitter price. How fortunate the dead man\\nhad left a son to take revenge upon\\nthe wicked, scheming killer, that Aegisthus,\\nwho killed Orestes’ father. My dear boy,\\nI see that you are tall and strong. Be brave, \\nso you will be remembered.”\\nThoughtfully\\nTelemachus replied, “Your Majesty,\\nKing Nestor, yes. Orestes took revenge.\\nThe Greeks will make him famous through the world\\nand into future times. I wish the gods\\nwould grant me that much power against those men\\nwho threaten and insult me—those cruel suitors!\\nThe gods have not yet granted us this blessing,\\nmy father and myself. We must endure.”\\nGerenian Nestor, lord of horses, answered, \\n“Dear boy, since you have brought the subject up,\\nI have been told about your mother’s suitors,\\nhow badly they are treating you at home.\\nBut do you willingly submit to it?\\nOr has a god’s voice led the townspeople\\nto hate you? Well, who knows, perhaps one day\\nhe will come home and take revenge, alone,\\nor with an army of the Greeks. If only\\nAthena loved you, as she used to care\\nfor glorious Odysseus at Troy \\nwhen we were doing badly. I have never\\nseen gods display such favor as she gave\\nwhen she stood by your father. If she helped you\\nwith that much love, the suitors would forget\\ntheir hopes for marriage.”\\nThen Telemachus\\nreplied, “My lord, I doubt that this will happen.\\nI am surprised you have such confidence.\\nI would not be so hopeful, even if\\nthe gods were willing.”\\nThen the goddess spoke.\\n“Telemachus, what do you mean? A god \\ncan easily save anyone, at will,\\nno matter what the distance. I would rather\\nsuﬀer immensely, but then get home safe,\\nthan die on my return like Agamemnon,\\nmurdered by his own wife, and by Aegisthus.\\nBut death is universal. Even gods\\ncannot protect the people that they love,\\nwhen fate and cruel death catch up with them.”\\nTelemachus said apprehensively,\\n“Mentor, this is upsetting. Change the subject. \\nHe has no real chance now of getting home.\\nThe gods have fenced him round with death and\\ndarkness.\\nLet me ask Nestor something else—he is\\nwiser and more informed than anyone.\\nThey say he ruled for three whole generations.\\nHe looks to me like some immortal god.\\nSo Nestor, son of Neleus, tell me truly,\\nhow did the great King Agamemnon die?\\nAnd where was Menelaus? Was he lost,\\naway from Greece, when that Aegisthus dared \\nto kill a king, a better man than him?\\nHow did that wicked trickster’s plot succeed?”\\nGerenian Nestor, lord of horses, answered,\\n“I will tell everything—though you can guess\\nwhat would have happened if fair Menelaus\\nhad found Aegisthus living in his halls\\non his return. And even when he died,\\nno one would bury him; he lay upon\\nthe open plain without a tomb and far\\nfrom town for birds and dogs to eat. No Greek \\nwould mourn that monster. While we fought and labored\\nat Troy, this layabout sat safe in Argos,\\nseducing Clytemnestra, noble wife\\nof Agamemnon. For a while, she scorned\\nhis foul suggestions, since her heart was good.\\nMoreover, when her husband went to Troy,\\nhe left a poet, ordered to protect her.\\nBut finally Fate forced the queen to yield.\\nAegisthus left the poet to be eaten\\nby birds, abandoned on a desert island. \\nHe led the woman back to his own house\\nby mutual desire, and then he made\\nnumerous oﬀerings on holy altars\\nof animals and lovely gold and cloth:\\nhe had succeeded far beyond his hopes.\\nAnd meanwhile, I left Troy with Menelaus;\\nwe sailed together, best of friends. We reached\\nthe holy cape of Athens, Sounion.\\nThere Phoebus with his gentle arrows shot\\nand killed the pilot, Phrontis, as he held \\nthe ship’s helm as she sped along. No man\\nknew better how to steer through any storm,\\nso Menelaus stopped to bury him\\nwith proper rites. At last he sailed again\\nacross the wine-dark sea; but as his ships\\nrushed round the craggy heights of Malea,\\nfar-seeing Zeus sent curses on his journey,\\npouring out screaming winds and giant waves\\nthe size of mountains—splitting up the fleet.\\nSome ships were hurled to Crete, to River Jardan, \\nwhere the Cydonian people have their homes.\\nThere steep rock rises sheer above the sea\\nnear Gortyn in the misty deep; south winds\\ndrive mighty waves towards the left-hand crag,\\nand push them west to Phaestus; one small rock\\nrestrains the massive currents. All the ships\\nwere smashed by waves against those rocks. The men\\nwere almost drowned. Five other dark-prowed ships\\nwere blown by wind and sea away to Egypt.\\nThere Menelaus gathered wealth and gold \\nand drifted with his ships through foreign lands.\\nMeanwhile at home, Aegisthus had been plotting.\\nHe killed the son of Atreus and seized\\ncontrol of rich Mycenae, where he reigned\\nfor seven years. But in the eighth, Orestes\\ncame to destroy him. He returned from Athens,\\nand killed his father’s murderer, then called\\nthe Argives to a funeral, a feast\\nfor clever, scheming, cowardly Aegisthus\\nwhom he had killed, and his own hated mother. \\nThat very day, rambunctious Menelaus\\narrived with all his ships crammed full of treasure.\\nThe moral is, you must not stay away\\ntoo long, dear boy, when those proud suitors lurk\\ninside your house. They may divide your wealth\\namong themselves and make your journey useless.\\nBut I suggest you go to Menelaus.\\nHe recently returned from lands so distant\\nno one would even hope to get home safe\\nonce driven by the winds so far oﬀ course, \\nover such dangerous, enormous seas.\\nBirds migrate there and take a year or more\\nto travel back. Go visit him by ship\\nwith your own crew. Or if you would prefer,\\nyou can go there by land—here is a carriage.\\nMy sons can guide you all the way to Sparta,\\nto Menelaus. Ask him for the truth.\\nHe will not lie; he is an honest man.”\\nThe sun went down and darkness fell. The goddess,\\nbright-eyed Athena, spoke to them.\\n“King Nestor, \\nyour speech was good and your advice was sound.\\nBut now slice up the tongues and pour the wine\\nfor Lord Poseidon and the other gods\\nbefore we rest—time now to go to bed.\\nThe light is fading and it is not right\\nto linger at a banquet in the dark.”\\nThe people listened to Athena’s words.\\nThe house slaves poured fresh water on their hands,\\nand boys filled up the mixing bowls with wine,\\nand poured it into cups, and first prepared \\nthe sacrifice. They threw tongues on the fire,\\nthen sprinkled wine, then each man drank his fill.\\nThen Zeus’ daughter and the godlike boy\\nboth rose to go together to their ship.\\nBut Nestor called to stop them.\\n“Zeus forbids it!\\nAnd all the other gods who live forever!\\nYou cannot leave my house for your swift ship\\nas if I were a poor and ragged man\\nwith so few beds and blankets in his home\\nthat neither he nor guests can sleep in comfort. \\nI have soft quilts and blankets in abundance.\\nThe darling son of great Odysseus\\nmust not sleep on the ship’s deck, while I live!\\nNot while my sons remain here in my house,\\nready to welcome anyone who visits.”\\nThe bright-eyed goddess answered him, “Old friend,\\nyou are quite right. Telemachus should do\\njust as you say. That is a better plan.\\nHe will stay here tonight and go to sleep\\nin your fine palace. But I must go back \\nto tell the crew the news and keep them strong.\\nYou see, I am the oldest in our party.\\nThe rest are younger men, close friends together,\\nthe same age as our brave Telemachus.\\nI will sleep there beside the hollow ship.\\nAt dawn I have important obligations:\\nto visit with the great Cauconians.\\nThe boy can be your guest. Then send him oﬀ\\nescorted by your son. Give him a carriage,\\ndrawn by your strongest and most nimble horses.” \\nBright-eyed Athena flew away, transformed\\ninto an ossifrage. Astonishment\\nseized all the people watching, even Nestor.\\nHe seized Telemachus’ hand and said,\\n“Dear boy, I am now sure that you will be\\na hero, since the gods are on your side\\nat your young age. This was a god, none other\\nthan great Athena, true-born child of Zeus,\\nwho also glorified your noble father.\\nGoddess, be kind to us as well, and grant \\nhonor to me, my good wife, and our sons.\\nNow I will sacrifice a yearling heifer,\\nbroad-browed and still unyoked, and gild her horns\\nwith gold to bless your journey.”\\nSo he spoke,\\nand Pallas heard his prayer. Gerenian Nestor\\nled them and led his sons and sons-in-law\\ninside his own magnificent great hall.\\nWhen they were all inside, he seated them\\non benches and on chairs arranged in order,\\nand he himself mixed up the bowl for them \\nof sweet delicious wine. He had preserved it\\neleven years. The slave girl opened it,\\npulling the lid oﬀ. As the old man mixed,\\nhe prayed and poured libations for Athena.\\nThey all poured also, then they drank their fill,\\nthen each went home to sleep in his own chamber.\\nNestor the horseman made a special bed\\nright there for his dear friend, the warrior’s son:\\na camp bed on the echoing portico,\\nbeside Pisistratus, the only son \\nnot living with a wife but still at home.\\nNestor himself slept by his wife, the queen,\\nin a secluded corner of the palace.\\nWhen newborn Dawn appeared with rosy fingers,\\nthe horse-lord Nestor jumped up out of bed,\\nand hurried down towards the polished stones\\nthat stood outside his palace, bright with oil.\\nThere Neleus used to give godlike advice,\\nuntil Fate took him and he went to Hades,\\nand Nestor, guardian of the Greeks, took over \\nthe scepter. From their rooms his sons arrived\\nto throng around him: Echephron and Stratius,\\nAretus, Perseus, great Thrasymedes,\\nand strong Pisistratus the sixth. They brought\\ngodlike Telemachus to sit with them.\\nNestor spoke first.\\n“Dear sons, now hurry up,\\nfulfill my wishes. First we must appease\\nAthena, who revealed herself to me\\nduring the holy feast. Now one of you\\nmust run down to the fields to choose a cow; \\nlet herdsmen drive her back here. And another,\\ngo to Telemachus’ ship and bring\\nthe men—leave only two behind. Another\\nmust bring Laerces here, who pours the gold,\\nso he can gild the heifer’s horns. You others,\\nstay here together. Tell the girls inside\\nto cook a royal feast, and set out seats,\\nput wood around the altar, and clear water.”\\nAt that, the sons all got to work. The cow\\nwas brought up from the field. The crew arrived \\nfrom the swift, solid ship. The goldsmith came\\nwith all the bronze tools useful for his trade—\\nhammer and anvil and well-crafted tongs—\\nand worked the gold. Athena came to take\\nthe sacrifice. King Nestor gave the gold;\\nthe craftsman poured it on the horns, to make\\na lovely oﬀering to please the goddess.\\nStratius and Echephron together led\\nthe heifer by the horns. Aretes came\\nand brought a water bowl adorned with flowers, \\nand in his other hand, a box of grain.\\nStrong Thrasymedes stood nearby and held\\na sharpened axe, prepared to strike the cow.\\nPerseus held the blood-bowl. Nestor started\\nto sprinkle barley-groats and ritual water,\\nand as he threw the hairs into the fire\\nhe said prayers to Athena. When the rites\\nwere finished, mighty Thrasymedes struck.\\nThe axe sliced through the sinews of the neck.\\nThe cow was paralyzed. Then Nestor’s daughters \\nand his sons’ wives, and his own loyal queen,\\nEurydice, began to chant. The men\\nhoisted the body, and Pisistratus\\nsliced through her throat. Black blood poured out. The\\nlife\\nwas gone. They butchered her, cut out the thighs,\\nall in the proper place, and covered them\\nwith double fat and placed raw flesh upon them.\\nThe old king burned the pieces on the logs,\\nand poured the bright red wine. The young men came\\nto stand beside him holding five-pronged forks. \\nThey burned the thigh-bones thoroughly and tasted\\nthe entrails, then carved up the rest and skewered\\nthe meat on pointed spits, and roasted it.\\nMeanwhile, Telemachus was being washed\\nby Nestor’s eldest daughter, Polycaste.\\nWhen she had washed and rubbed his skin with oil\\nshe dressed him in a tunic and fine cloak\\nand he emerged; his looks were like a god’s.\\nHe sat by Nestor, shepherd of the people.\\nThe meat was roasted and drawn oﬀ the spits. \\nThey sat to eat, while trained slaves served the food,\\npouring the wine for them in golden cups.\\nAfter their hunger and their thirst were gone,\\nGerenian Nestor, horse-lord, started talking.\\n“My sons, now bring two horses with fine manes\\nand yoke them to the carriage, so our guest\\ncan start his journey.”\\nThey obeyed at once,\\nand quickly latched swift horses to the carriage.\\nOne of the house girls brought out food and wine\\nand delicacies fit to feed a king. \\nTelemachus got in the lovely carriage;\\nPisistratus, the son of Nestor, followed,\\nand sat beside him, taking up the reins,\\nand whipped the horses. Eagerly they flew\\noﬀ for the open plain, and left the town.\\nAll day they ran and made the harness rattle.\\nAt sunset when the streets grew dark, they came\\nto Pherae, to the home of Diocles,\\nson of Ortilochus; Alpheus was\\nhis grandfather. They spent the night as guests. \\nWhen rosy-fingered Dawn came bright and early,\\nthey yoked the horses to the painted carriage,\\nand drove out from the gate and echoing porch.\\nAt a light touch of whip, the horses flew.\\nSwiftly they drew towards their journey’s end,\\non through the fields of wheat, until the sun\\nbegan to set and shadows filled the streets.\\nBOOK \\nWhat the Sea God Said\\nThey came to Sparta, land of caves and valleys,\\nand drove to Menelaus’ house. They found him\\nhosting a wedding feast for many guests\\nto celebrate his children’s marriages.\\nIn Troy he had declared that he would give\\nhis daughter to Achilles’ son, who ruled\\nthe Myrmidons. Now he was sending her,\\nwith dowry gifts of horse-drawn chariots;\\nthe gods had made the marriage come to pass.\\nAnd he was welcoming a Spartan bride, \\nAlector’s daughter, for his well-loved son,\\nstrong Megapenthes, mothered by a slave.\\nThe gods had given Helen no more children\\nafter the beautiful Hermione,\\nimage of Aphrodite all in gold.\\nNeighbors and family were feasting gladly\\nunder the king’s high roof. The bard was singing\\nand strumming, and two acrobats were spinning\\nand leading them in dance. Telemachus\\nand Nestor’s son stopped by the palace doors \\nand held their horses. Menelaus’ guard,\\nEteoneus, ran out and saw them there,\\nand then hurried back inside to tell his master.\\n“Your Majesty, there are two men outside,\\nstrangers who seem like sons of Zeus. Please tell me,\\nshould we take oﬀ the harness from their horses?\\nOr send them oﬀ to find another host?”\\nFlushed Menelaus shouted angrily,\\n“You used to have some brains!\\nNow you are talking like a silly child. \\nWe two were fed by many diﬀerent hosts\\nbefore returning home. As we may hope\\nfor Zeus to keep us safe in future times,\\nuntack their horses! Lead them in to dine!”\\nSo Eteoneus rushed out from the palace,\\nand ordered other slaves to follow him.\\nThey freed the sweating horses from their yoke\\nand tied them by the manger, which they filled\\nwith emmer that they mixed with bright white barley.\\nThey leaned the carriage up against the wall \\nand led their guests inside the godlike house.\\nThe boys looked round the palace in amazement:\\nthe lofty halls of famous Menelaus\\nshone like the dazzling light of sun or moon.\\nWhen they had satisfied their eyes with staring,\\nthey went to take a bath in polished tubs.\\nThe slave girls helped them wash and rubbed them down\\nin olive oil, then dressed them in wool cloaks\\nand tunics, and then seated them beside\\nthe son of Atreus, King Menelaus. \\nA house girl brought a basin made of silver,\\nand water in a golden jug. She poured it\\nover their hands to wash, then set a table\\nof polished wood beside them, and a humble\\nslave girl brought bread and many canapes,\\na lavish spread. The carver carried platters\\nwith every kind of meat, and set before them\\ncups made of gold. Then ruddy Menelaus\\nwelcomed them both and told them,\\n“Help yourselves!\\nEnjoy the food! When you have shared our meal, \\nwe will begin to ask you who you are.\\nYour fathers must be scepter-bearing kings;\\nthe sons of peasants do not look like you.”\\nWith that, he took the dish of rich roast meat,\\ncut from the back, which was his special meal,\\nand oﬀered it to them. They reached their hands\\nto take the food set out in front of them.\\nAfter their thirst and hunger had been sated,\\nTelemachus turned round to Nestor’s son,\\nducking his head so no one else could hear. \\n“Pisistratus! Dear friend, do you see how\\nthese echoing halls are shining bright with bronze,\\nand silver, gold and ivory and amber?\\nIt is as full of riches as the palace\\nof Zeus on Mount Olympus! I am struck\\nwith awe.” When Menelaus heard his words,\\nhe spoke to them in turn—his words flew out.\\n“No mortal, my dear boys, can rival Zeus.\\nHis halls and home and property are deathless.\\nSome man may match my wealth; or maybe not. \\nI suﬀered for it. I was lost, adrift\\nat sea for eight long years. I traipsed through Cyprus,\\nPhoenicia, Egypt, Ethiopia,\\nSidon and Araby, and Libya,\\nwhere lambs are born with horns—their ewes give birth\\nthree times a year. The master and his slave\\nhave milk and cheese and meat; the flock provides\\nsweet milk year round. But while I wandered there\\naccumulating wealth, someone crept in\\nand killed my brother; his own scheming wife \\nbetrayed him. I can take no joy in all\\nmy wealth. Whoever they may be, your fathers\\nhave surely told you how much I have suﬀered!\\nI lost my lovely home, and I was parted\\nfor many years from all my splendid riches.\\nI wish I had stayed here, with just a third\\nof all the treasure I have now acquired,\\nif those who died at Troy, so far away\\nfrom Argive pastures, were alive and well.\\nI sit here in my palace, mourning all \\nwho died, and often weeping. Sometimes tears\\nbring comfort to my heart, but not for long;\\ncold grief grows sickening. I miss them all,\\nbut one man most. When I remember him,\\nI cannot eat or sleep, since no one labored\\nlike him—Odysseus. His destiny\\nwas suﬀering, and mine the endless pain\\nof missing him. We do not even know\\nif he is still alive—he has been gone\\nso long. His faithful wife and old Laertes \\nmust grieve for him, and young Telemachus,\\nwho was a newborn when he went away.”\\nThese words roused in the boy a desperate need\\nto mourn his father. Tears rolled down his face\\nand splashed down on the ground. He lifted up\\nhis cloak to hide his eyes. But Menelaus\\nnoticed and wondered whether he should wait\\nuntil the boy first spoke about his father,\\nor ask. As he was hesitating, Helen\\nemerged from her high-ceilinged, fragrant bedroom, \\nlike Artemis, who carries golden arrows.\\nAdraste set a special chair for her,\\nAlcippe spread upon it soft wool blankets,\\nand Phylo brought a silver sewing basket,\\ngiven to her by Alcandre, the wife\\nof Polybus, who lived in Thebes, in Egypt,\\nwhere people have extraordinary wealth.\\nHe gave two silver tubs to Menelaus,\\na pair of tripods and ten pounds of gold.\\nHis wife gave other lovely gifts for Helen: \\na golden spindle and this silver basket\\non wheels; the rims were finished oﬀ with gold.\\nPhylo, her girl, brought out that basket now,\\npacked full of yarn she had already spun.\\nA spindle wound around with purple wool\\nwas laid across it. She sat down and put\\nher feet upon a stool, and asked her husband,\\n“Do we know who these men are, Menelaus,\\nwho have arrived here in our house? Shall I\\nconceal my thoughts or speak? I feel compelled \\nto say, the sight of them amazes me.\\nI never saw two people so alike\\nas this boy and Telemachus, the son\\nof spirited Odysseus, the child\\nhe left behind, a little newborn baby,\\nthe day the Greeks marched oﬀ to Troy, their minds\\nfixated on the war and violence.\\nThey made my face the cause that hounded them.”\\nHigh-colored Menelaus answered, “Wife,\\nI saw the likeness too. Odysseus \\nhad hands like those, those legs, that hair, that head,\\nthat glancing gaze. And when I spoke just now\\nabout Odysseus and all the things\\nhe suﬀered for my sake, the boy grimaced,\\nand floods of tears were rolling down his cheeks;\\nhe raised his purple cloak to hide his eyes.”\\nPisistratus, the son of Nestor, spoke.\\n“King Menelaus, you are right. This is\\nthat warrior’s true-born son, just as you said.\\nBut he is shy and feels he should not speak \\ntoo boldly in your presence right away.\\nYour voice is like a god’s to us. Lord Nestor\\nsent me to guide him here. He longed to see you\\nto get some news from you or some advice.\\nA son whose father is away will suﬀer\\nintensely, if he has no man at home\\nto help him. In the absence of his father,\\nTelemachus has no one to protect him.”\\nThen Menelaus answered, “So the son\\nof my dear friend, who worked so hard for me, \\nhas come here to my house! I always thought\\nthat I would greet that friend with warmth beyond\\nall other Argives, if Zeus let us sail\\nhome with all speed across the sea. I would have\\nbrought him from Ithaca, with all his wealth,\\nhis son and people, and bestowed on him\\na town in Argos, driving out the natives\\nfrom somewhere hereabouts under my rule.\\nWe would have constantly spent time together.\\nNothing would have divided us in love \\nand joy, till death’s dark cloud surrounded us.\\nBut I suppose the god begrudged our friendship,\\nand kept that poor, unlucky man from home.”\\nHis words made everybody want to cry.\\nHelen was weeping, as was Menelaus.\\nPisistratus’ eyes were full of tears\\nfor irreplaceable Antilochus,\\nkilled by the noble son of shining Dawn.\\nMindful of him, he spoke with words like wings.\\n“King Menelaus, when we spoke of you \\nback home in our own halls, my father Nestor\\nalways declared you are exceptional\\nfor common sense. So listen now to me.\\nI disapprove of crying during dinner.\\nDawn will soon come; weep then. There is no harm\\nin mourning when a person dies; it is\\nthe only honor we can pay the dead—\\nto cut our hair and drench our cheeks with tears.\\nI had a brother named Antilochus,\\none of the bravest fighters in the army, \\na sprinter and a warrior. He died.\\nI never got to meet him or to see him.\\nPerhaps you did?”\\nKing Menelaus answered,\\n“My friend, you speak just as a wise man should,\\nlike somebody much older than yourself.\\nYou show your father’s wisdom in your speech.\\nA lineage is easy to discern\\nwhen Zeus spins out a life of happiness,\\nin marriage and in oﬀspring. So he gave\\ngood luck to Nestor all his life; he aged \\nat home in comfort, and his sons are wise\\nand skillful spear-men. Yes, we will stop crying\\nand turn our minds to dinner once again.\\nLet them pour water on our hands. At dawn,\\nTelemachus and I can talk at length.”\\nAt that Asphalion, the nimble house slave\\nof mighty Menelaus, poured the water\\nover their hands. They helped themselves to food\\nfrom laden tables. Then the child of Zeus,\\nHelen, decided she would mix the wine \\nwith drugs to take all pain and rage away,\\nto bring forgetfulness of every evil.\\nWhoever drinks this mixture from the bowl\\nwill shed no tears that day, not even if\\nher mother or her father die, nor even\\nif soldiers kill her brother or her darling\\nson with bronze spears before her very eyes.\\nHelen had these powerful magic drugs\\nfrom Polydamna, wife of Thon, from Egypt,\\nwhere fertile fields produce the most narcotics: \\nsome good, some dangerous. The people there\\nare skillful doctors. They are the Healer’s people.\\nShe mixed the wine and told the slave to pour it,\\nand then she spoke again.\\n“Now Menelaus,\\nand you two noble sons of noble men,\\nZeus gives us good and bad at diﬀerent times;\\nhe has the power. Sit here then and eat,\\nand I will entertain you with a story.\\nEnjoy it; it is fitting to the times.\\nI cannot tell of all the challenges \\nsteadfast Odysseus has undergone.\\nBut I will tell you what that brave man did\\nat Troy, when the Achaeans were in trouble.\\nHe beat himself and bruised his body badly\\nand put a ragged cloak on, like a slave,\\nthen shuﬄed through the enemy city streets.\\nIn his disguise he seemed a poor old beggar,\\nhardly a man to sail with the Achaeans.\\nHe crept through Troy like that, and no one knew him\\nexcept for me. I saw through his disguise \\nand questioned him. He was too smart to talk,\\nacting evasive. But I washed and scrubbed him\\nwith oil and dressed him, and I swore an oath\\nthat I would not reveal him to the Trojans\\nbefore he had got back to his own camp.\\nHe told me all the things the Greeks were planning.\\nOn his way back, he used his long bronze sword\\nto slaughter many Trojans, and he brought\\nuseful intelligence to tell the Greeks.\\nThe Trojan women keened in grief, but I \\nwas glad—by then I wanted to go home.\\nI wished that Aphrodite had not made me\\ngo crazy, when she took me from my country,\\nand made me leave my daughter and the bed\\nI shared with my fine, handsome, clever husband.”\\nAnd Menelaus said,\\n“Yes, wife, quite right.\\nI have been round the world, and I have met\\nmany heroic men and known their minds.\\nI never saw a man so resolute\\nas that Odysseus. How tough he was! \\nAnd what impressive fortitude he showed\\ninside the Wooden Horse! We fighters lurked\\ninside, to bring destruction to the Trojans.\\nYou came there too. Some spirit who desired\\nto glorify the Trojans urged you on.\\nGodlike Deiphobus was following you.\\nThree times you went around the hollow belly,\\ntouching the hiding place, and calling on\\nus Greeks by name; you put on diﬀerent voices\\nfor each man’s wife. Then I and Diomedes \\nand good Odysseus, inside the horse,\\nheard you call out to us, and we two wanted\\nto go out, or to answer from in there.\\nOdysseus prevented us from going.\\nThen all the other sons of the Achaeans\\nwere quiet; Anticlus still wished to answer.\\nOdysseus’ hands clamped shut his mouth\\nand saved us all. He held him there like that,\\nuntil Athena led you far away.”\\nWeighing these words, Telemachus replied, \\n“But Menelaus, all this makes it worse!\\nMy father’s courage could not save his life,\\neven if he had had a heart of iron.\\nSo now, show us to bed. We need the comfort\\nof being lulled into a sweet deep sleep.”\\nThen Argive Helen told her girls to spread\\nbeds on the porch and pile on them fine rugs\\nof purple, and lay blankets over them,\\nwith woolly covers on the very top.\\nThe girls went out with torches in their hands \\nand made the beds. A slave led out the guests.\\nTelemachus and Nestor’s handsome son\\nslept in the front room; Menelaus slept\\nfar back inside the lofty house. Beside him\\nlay marvelous Helen, in her flowing gown.\\nSoon Dawn was born, her fingers bright with roses.\\nGruﬀ Menelaus jumped up out of bed,\\ngot dressed and strapped his sharp sword to his\\nshoulder,\\nthen tied his sandals on his well-oiled feet.\\nHe went out of his bedroom like a god, \\napproached Telemachus, and spoke to him.\\n“What need has brought you here, Telemachus,\\nto Sparta, over such expanse of sea?\\nPrivate or public business? Tell me truly!”\\nTelemachus inhaled and then replied,\\n“King Menelaus, son of Atreus,\\nI came in search of news about my father.\\nMy house is being eaten up; our wealth\\nis ruined. My whole home is full of men\\nwho mean me harm—my mother’s loutish suitors. \\nEach day they kill more sheep, more longhorn cattle.\\nSo I am begging you, here on my knees,\\ntell me the dreadful news, if he is dead!\\nPerhaps you saw it with your eyes, or heard\\ntales of his travels. He was surely born\\nto suﬀer in extraordinary ways.\\nPlease do not try to sweeten bitter news\\nfrom pity; tell me truly if you saw him,\\nand how he was. If my heroic father\\never helped you at Troy when things were bad, \\nkeep that in mind right now, and tell the truth.”\\nFlushed, Menelaus shouted out in anger,\\n“Damn them! Those cowards want to steal the bed\\nof one whose heart is braver than their own.\\nAs when a deer lays down two newborn fawns,\\nstill sucklings, in the lair of some strong lion,\\nand goes to look for pasture, over slopes\\nand grassy valleys; when the lion comes back\\nto his own bed, he brings down doom on them—\\nso will Odysseus upon those men. \\nO Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo,\\nI pray he is as strong as when he stood\\nto wrestle Philomeleides, on Lesbos,\\nand hurled him to the ground, and we all cheered.\\nSo may Odysseus attack the suitors.\\nMay all their lives be brief, their weddings cursed!\\nAs for your questions, I will not deceive you.\\nI will not hide a single word I heard\\nfrom that old Sea God Proteus. Although\\nI longed to come back home, away from Egypt, \\nthe gods prevented me, since I had failed\\nto oﬀer perfect hecatombs. They always\\ndesire obedience. There is an island\\nout in the sea beside the coast of Egypt,\\nnamed Pharos. If a clear wind blows your ship,\\nit takes all day to travel to that island.\\nIts harbor has good anchorage, and there\\nmen draw dark water up, and then launch oﬀ\\nto sea. But I was held for twenty days\\nby gods. No winds appeared to guide my ships \\nacross the water’s back. All our supplies\\nwould have been gone, and all our hope; but then\\na goddess, Eidothea, pitied me—\\nthe child of Proteus, the old sea god.\\nShe met me pacing sadly all alone.\\nMy men were oﬀ around the island, fishing\\nwith hooks, as usual—hunger pinched their bellies.\\nShe stood beside me and she spoke to me.\\n‘Stranger, are you so foolish that you choose\\nto give up, and take pleasure in your pain? \\nThere is no end in sight; you have been stuck\\nhere on this island for so long. Your men\\ngrow weak at heart.’ I answered her and said,\\n‘Whoever you may be—for sure a goddess—\\nI tell you I am trapped against my will.\\nI must have sinned against the deathless gods\\nwho live in heaven. Please explain which spirit\\nis blocking me from going home across\\nthe teeming sea. Gods must know everything.’\\nThat shining goddess answered me at once, \\n‘Stranger, I will be frank with you. A deathless\\nold sea god haunts this place, named Proteus\\nof Egypt, who can speak infallibly,\\nwho knows the depths of seas, and serves Poseidon.\\nThey say he is the one who fathered me.\\nIf you can somehow lie in wait and catch him,\\nhe will explain how you can get back home,\\nplotting your path where fish leap through the waters.\\nAnd if you wish it, prince, he will explain\\nwhat happened in your home, both good and bad, \\nwhile you were gone on this long, painful journey.’\\nThose were her words. I answered, ‘Tell me, please,\\nhow I can trap this ancient god, so he\\nwill not see me too soon, and get away.\\nIt is not easy for a man to catch\\na god.’ The goddess answered me at once,\\n‘Stranger, I will instruct you thoroughly.\\nWhen the sun hits the midpoint of the sky,\\nthe old god bobs above the salty water;\\nthe breath of Zephyr hides him in dark shade. \\nHe goes to take his nap inside the caves.\\nAround him sleep the clustering seals, the daughters\\nof lovely Lady Brine. Their breath smells sour\\nfrom gray seawater, pungent salty depths.\\nSelect the three best men you have on board,\\nand when dawn breaks, I will take all of you\\ndown to the shore, and set you in a line.\\nLet me explain the old god’s tricks. He will\\nfirst count the seals and walk around among them.\\nWhen he has counted them and checked them all, \\nhe lies down in the middle, like a shepherd\\namong his flock of sheep. When you observe\\nhim sleeping, gather all your force and strength,\\nand hold him there, despite his desperate struggles.\\nIn trying to escape, he will change shape\\nto every animal on earth, and then\\nwater and holy fire. You must hold fast\\nunshaken, and press harder; keep him down.\\nAt last he will assume again the form\\nin which he went to sleep, and he will speak \\nand question you. Then, warrior, release\\nyour forceful hold on that old god, and ask him\\nwhich god is angry with you, and the way\\nto cross the fish-filled waters and go home.’\\nWith that she sank beneath the deep sea waves.\\nI went down to the ships upon the sand.\\nMy heart was surging in me as I walked.\\nArriving at the ships and at the shore,\\nwe made our meal. Then came immortal night;\\nwe went to sleep beside the water’s edge. \\nWhen Dawn appeared, her fingers bright with flowers,\\nI walked beside the spreading sea, along\\nthe dunes, and prayed intensely to the gods.\\nThen I chose out my three most trusted men.\\nThe goddess dove down deep inside the sea\\nand brought four sealskins up from underwater,\\nnew-flayed—to help her plot against her father.\\nShe scooped out hiding places in the sand,\\nand sat to wait. We came right up to her.\\nShe laid us in a row, and put a skin \\non each. It would have been a dismal hideout,\\nstinking of salt-bred seals. Who would lie down\\nto rest beside a creature from the sea?\\nBut she brought sweet ambrosia to save us.\\nShe very kindly put it in our nostrils,\\nto take away the stench of seal. We waited\\nall morning, apprehensively. And then\\nout of the sea there rose a pod of seals;\\nthey lay along the shore. At noon the god\\nemerged above the waves. He went among \\nhis fatted seals and counted out their number.\\nHe counted us among the first of them,\\nsuspecting nothing. Then he lay down too.\\nWith a great shout we pounced on him and grabbed him.\\nThe old god still remembered all his tricks,\\nand first became a lion with a mane,\\nthen snake, then leopard, then a mighty boar,\\nthen flowing water, then a leafy tree.\\nBut we kept holding on: our hearts stood firm.\\nAt last that ancient sorcerer grew tired, \\nand then he asked me, ‘Son of Atreus!\\nWhat god devised this plan with you and taught you\\nto lurk and capture me against my will?\\nWhat do you want from me?’ And I replied,\\n‘Old god, why do you want to throw me oﬀ?\\nYou know I have been trapped here on this island\\nfor far too long, with no way out; my heart\\ngrows faint. So tell me—gods know everything—\\nwhat spirit stops my journey? And how can I\\nget home across the watery shoals of fish?’ \\nAt once he answered me and told me this:\\n‘You should have given Zeus and other gods\\nfine oﬀerings, to speed your journey home\\nacross the wine-dark sea. It is your fate\\nnot to go home or see the ones you love\\nuntil you go again to Egypt’s river,\\nwatered by Zeus, and kill a hundred cows,\\nto please the deathless gods who live in heaven.\\nThen they will let you travel where you wish.’\\nI felt heartbroken that I had to cross \\nthe misty sea and go again to Egypt:\\na long and bitter journey! But I answered,\\n‘Sir, I will do exactly as you say.\\nBut come now, tell me this, and tell me truly,\\ndid all the Greeks sail safely home by ship,\\nwhom Nestor and myself left there in Troy?\\nDid any meet a dreadful death at sea,\\non his own ship, or in familiar arms,\\nafter the war wound up?’ When I said this,\\nat once he answered me and said these words. \\n‘O son of Atreus! Why ask me this?\\nYou have no need to know or learn my mind.\\nWhen I have told you, you will not be long\\nable to hold back tears. So many men\\nwere killed, and many left behind at Troy.\\nJust two of all the bronze-clad captains died\\nwhile traveling back home; one more perhaps\\nmay be alive, trapped somewhere out at sea.\\nAjax was drowned; his ships were sunk. Poseidon\\nfirst drove him to the rocks of Gyrae, then \\nrescued him from the sea; he would have lived,\\ndespite Athena’s hatred, but he made\\na crazy boast—that he survived the waves\\nagainst the wishes of the gods. Poseidon\\nheard his rash words. At once, he seized his trident\\nin mighty hands, and hit the Gyran rock.\\nOne half remained; the other, on which Ajax\\nsat as he boasted, cracked right oﬀ and fell\\ninto the sea, and carried him deep down.\\nThe boundless waves washed over him; he drank \\nthe salty brine, and died. But Agamemnon\\nsurvived—the goddess Hera saved his fleet.\\nWhen he had almost reached the craggy mountain\\nof Malea, a gust of wind took hold\\nand bore him over waves where fish were jumping,\\nacross the rumbling depths to where all farms\\nare finished, where Thyestes used to live,\\nand now his son Aegisthus. After that,\\nthe route was clear: the gods made all winds fair.\\nThen joyfully he stepped foot in his country, \\nand touched and kissed the earth of his dear home.\\nHe wept hot floods of tears, from happiness.\\nBut from the lookout post the watchman saw him.\\nScheming Aegisthus paid that man two talents\\nof gold to watch all year, so Agamemnon\\ncould not slip past unseen, or summon up\\nhis will to fight. The spy rushed oﬀ to tell\\nthe King. Aegisthus formed a plan at once.\\nHe chose the twenty best men in the land\\nto lurk in ambush, and he told the house slaves \\nto cook a feast. He rode out on his carriage,\\nand summoned Agamemnon, who suspected\\nnothing. Aegisthus killed him over dinner,\\njust as a person kills an ox at manger.\\nAll of the men who came with him were killed,\\nand all those of Aegisthus; all were killed.’\\nHis story broke my heart, and I sat down\\nupon the sands and wept. I did not want\\nto go on living or to see the sun.\\nI thrashed around and wailed. When I was done, \\nthe old Sea God spoke words of truth to me.\\n‘Now, son of Atreus, your endless weeping\\nhas gone on long enough. It does no good.\\nQuickly, go home. You may still find Aegisthus\\nalive, or else Orestes may have come\\nand killed him; you can join his funeral.’\\nThose words made me a man again: my heart\\nwas warmed inside, despite my grief. My words\\ntook wings. I said, ‘I know now of those two;\\nbut name the third who may be still alive, \\ntrapped somewhere in the wide expanse of sea,\\nor may be dead. I know the news may hurt,\\nbut still I want to hear it.’ And he answered,\\n‘It is Laertes’ son, the Ithacan.\\nI saw him crying, shedding floods of tears\\nupon Calypso’s island, in her chambers.\\nShe traps him there; he cannot go back home.\\nHe has no boats with oars or crew to row him\\nacross the sea’s broad back to his own land.\\nBut Menelaus, it is not your fate \\nto die in Argos. Gods will carry you\\noﬀ to the world’s end, to Elysium.\\nThose fields are ruled by tawny Rhadamanthus\\nand life is there the easiest for humans.\\nThere is no snow, no heavy storms or rain,\\nbut Ocean always sends up gentle breezes\\nof Zephyr to refresh the people there.\\nYou gain these blessings as the son-in-law\\nof Zeus through Helen.’ Then the old god sank\\nbeneath the waves. I went back to my ships \\nand godlike men, and as I walked my mind\\nswirled with my many thoughts. Beside the fleet\\nwe cooked and ate our meal, then holy night\\ncame down; we slept beside the surging water.\\nWhen early Dawn appeared and touched the sky\\nwith blossom, first we launched the balanced ships\\ninto the salty sea, put up the masts\\nand fixed the sails, and then the men embarked\\nand sat on benches neatly, in their lines.\\nAnd then at once they struck the sea with oars. \\nWe soon reached Egypt’s holy rain-fed river.\\nWe docked the ships and sacrificed the oxen.\\nWhen I had quenched the anger of the gods,\\nI built a mound to honor Agamemnon,\\nfor his immortal fame. The gods at last\\ngave me fair wind, and sent me quickly home.\\nBut come now, stay with me here in my palace,\\nuntil eleven days or twelve have passed.\\nThen I will send you oﬀ with precious gifts,\\nthree horses and a gleaming chariot. \\nAlso a lovely cup so you can pour\\ngifts to the gods, and always think of me.”\\nThen tactfully Telemachus replied,\\n“Please do not keep me here so long, my lord.\\nIndeed, I would be glad to stay a year;\\nI would not even miss my home or parents—\\nI get such pleasure listening to you.\\nBut my poor friends are surely tired of waiting\\nin Pylos. You have made me stay too long.\\nAnd for a gift, please only give me treasure. \\nYou keep your lovely horses here; I cannot\\ntransport them all the way to Ithaca.\\nYou rule these open meadows, rich in clover,\\nwhite barley in wide rows, and wheat and grass.\\nIn Ithaca, there are no fields or racetracks.\\nThough it is only fit for goats, we love it\\nmore than horse pasture. Islands out at sea\\nhave no good grazing—ours the least of all.”\\nThen Menelaus smiled and clasped his hand,\\nand spoke to him in his loud booming voice. \\n“My boy, your words are proof of your good blood.\\nI will give diﬀerent gifts, just as you ask.\\nI will give you the finest piece of treasure\\nof all the hoard I have piled up at home:\\na finely crafted bowl, of purest silver,\\nwith gold around the rim. Hephaestus made it,\\nand Phaedimus the king of Sidon gave it\\nto me, when I was visiting his house\\nas I was traveling home. You can have that.”\\nSuch was their conversation. Then the guests \\nentered the palace, bringing lamb and wine\\nthat gives one confidence. The girls, all dressed\\nin pretty scarves, brought bread for them. So went\\nthe feasting in the house of Menelaus.\\nMeanwhile, outside Odysseus’ house,\\nthe suitors were as arrogant as usual,\\nenjoying throwing discuses and spears\\nout on the playing field. The two chief suitors,\\nwere sitting there: Antinous and godlike\\nEurymachus. Just then Noemon, son \\nof Phronius, approached and asked a question.\\n“So do we know, Antinous, or not,\\nwhether Telemachus is coming back\\nfrom sandy Pylos? He left with my ship.\\nI need it, to cross over to the fields\\nof Elis, where I have twelve mares with mules\\nsuckling their teats and not yet broken in.\\nI want to take and train one.”\\nThey were all\\nastonished, since they had not thought the boy\\nwas gone to Pylos, but was somewhere near, \\nout with the sheep or pigs. Antinous\\nsaid,\\n“Tell me true, when did he go? And who\\nwent with him? Did he choose some Ithacans,\\nor slaves and laborers? It could be either.\\nAnd tell me also, did he steal the ship\\nfrom you by force, or did you give it to him\\nfreely, because he asked?”\\nNoemon, son\\nof Phronius, replied, “I gave it freely.\\nWhat could I do, when someone so upset\\nwas asking me? A noble boy like that? \\nIt would have been ungracious to refuse.\\nThe young men who were with him were high class,\\nthe best in town except ourselves. I saw\\nMentor embark as captain—or perhaps\\nnot Mentor but a god who looked like him.\\nThis puzzles me, that yesterday at dawn\\nI saw great Mentor here, though he had gone\\nto Pylos in the ship.”\\nWith that, Noemon\\ndeparted for his father’s house. Those leaders\\nwere furious. At once they made the suitors \\nstop playing games and sit. Antinous\\nspoke up with eyes bright as fire, his mind\\ndarkened with anger.\\n“Damn! That stuck-up boy\\nsucceeded in his stupid trip. We thought\\nhe would not manage it. Telemachus\\nhas launched a ship and picked an ideal crew,\\ndespite us all! This is the start of worse.\\nMay Zeus destroy his strength before he reaches\\nmanhood. Give me a ship and twenty men,\\nso I may watch and catch him in the strait \\nin between Ithaca and craggy Same.\\nA sad end to this journey for his father!”\\nAll of them praised his words, endorsed his plan,\\nand went inside Odysseus’ palace.\\nPenelope was soon aware of all\\nthe suitors’ secret plots. The house boy Medon\\ntold her, since he had been outside the courtyard\\nand he had heard the plans they were devising.\\nHe rushed to tell her. As he stepped inside,\\nacross the threshold, she came up and asked him, \\n“Well, boy, why have those lordly suitors sent you?\\nTo tell godlike Odysseus’ girls\\nto stop their work and make a feast for them?\\nI hope this is their final meal! I hope\\nthey never gather elsewhere to go courting!\\nYou suitors who come crowding here are wasting\\nTelemachus’ wealth! When you were younger\\nyou never paid attention to your fathers\\nwho told you of Odysseus’ greatness.\\nHe never spoke or acted without justice, \\namong the people. Lords are mostly biased;\\nthey favor one person and hate another.\\nBut he did not. He did no wrong at all.\\nNow you! Your wicked deeds and plans are clear.\\nNo gratitude for favors from the past!”\\nThen knowledgeable Medon answered her,\\n“My Queen, I wish this were the worst of it.\\nNow they are plotting even greater ruin.\\nMay Zeus ensure it never comes to pass!\\nThe suitors want to kill Telemachus \\nwith sharp bronze weapons on his journey home.\\nHe went to sandy Pylos and to Sparta\\nfor word about his father.”\\nAt the news,\\nher legs grew weak; her heart sank; she was struck\\ndumb for a time, her voice blocked as her eyes\\nfilled up with tears. At last she answered him,\\n“But why did my son go away? There was\\nno need to go on those swift ships that gallop\\nlike horses over miles of salty water.\\nDid he intend to lose his name as well, \\nand be unknown?”\\nAnd Medon said, “Perhaps\\nsome god or his own heart nudged him to go\\nto Pylos to find out about his father,\\nif he will come back home, or if he has\\nalready met his fate.” With that, he left her.\\nGrief wrapped around her, eating at her heart.\\nThe house was full of chairs but she could not\\nbear to sit upright. In her bedroom doorway,\\ncollapsing on the floor, she wept and cried.\\nAround her all her women, young and old, \\nwere whimpering. Voice thick with tears, she sobbed,\\n“Friends, listen! Zeus has cursed me more than all\\nthe women of my family. Already\\nI lost my noble, lionhearted husband,\\nmost talented and brave of all the Greeks,\\nwhose fame is spread through Greece. And now the\\nwinds\\nhave taken my dear son, and no one told me\\nthat he was setting out. Shame on you all!\\nYou knew that he was leaving in that ship!\\nNot one of you came here to wake me up! \\nIf only I had known about his journey,\\nhe would have stayed—no matter how he wanted\\nto leave—or else have left me dead right here.\\nNow call old Dolius, my gardener,\\nthe slave who cares for all my trees. My father\\ngave him to me when I came here. Tell him\\nto hurry oﬀ and sit beside Laertes,\\nand tell him everything; he may decide\\nto go in tears to plead with those who want\\nto kill godlike Odysseus’ son, \\nhis grandson.”\\nThen the loyal Eurycleia\\nsaid, “Lady, sweetheart, even if you take\\na sword and kill me, I will tell the truth.\\nI knew all this. I gave him what he asked for,\\nbread and sweet wine. He made me swear an oath\\nnot to inform you, till twelve days had passed,\\nor till you heard about it, and you missed him,\\nso that you would not cry and spoil your beauty.\\nNow have a bath, get changed into clean clothes,\\ngo with your slave girls upstairs to your room. \\nPray to Athena, child of Zeus the King.\\nShe may save him from death. And do not bother\\npoor old Laertes; he has pain enough.\\nI do not think the blessed gods despise\\nthis family; I trust that there will always\\nbe one to rule this house and rich estate.”\\nThis soothed Penelope. She dried her tears,\\nand took her bath and got dressed in clean clothes,\\nthen went up to her bedroom with her girls.\\nShe put some barley on a tray and prayed. \\n“Hear me, Athena, tireless child of Zeus,\\nif my quick-minded husband ever gave you\\nfat thighs of beef or lamb here in our halls,\\nremember now and save the son I love.\\nProtect him from the abuses of those suitors!”\\nShe wailed aloud; the goddess heard her prayer.\\nThe suitors made a racket that resounded\\nall through the palace shadows. They were boasting,\\n“This queen whom all of us have come here courting\\nis ready now to marry one of us, \\nand does not even know her son will die!”\\nThey spoke not knowing how things really stood.\\nAntinous declared to them,\\n“My lords,\\nyou have to stop this bragging! Quiet down,\\nor those inside will hear it. Now get up\\nin silence. We must go and follow through\\nthe plan we all agreed on in our hearts.”\\nWith that, he picked the twenty strongest men.\\nThey went down to the seashore; first of all\\nthey launched the swift black ship in deep saltwater, \\nset up the mast and raised the sails and fit\\nthe oars in proper order in the straps\\nof leather, then spread out the bright white sails.\\nWith confidence their slaves dealt out the weapons.\\nThey moored high up the stream and disembarked.\\nThey ate there, while they waited for the evening.\\nPenelope lay upstairs in her bedroom,\\nrefusing food and drink, consuming nothing.\\nShe wondered if her fine son would escape\\nfrom death, or be brought down by those proud suitors. \\nHer mind was like a lion, caught by humans,\\nwhen they are clustering round him in a circle,\\ntrying to trap him; so sweet drowsiness\\nsubdued her and she slept, her limbs relaxed.\\nAthena, bright-eyed goddess, had a plan.\\nShe made a phantom looking like a woman,\\nIphthime, child of great Icarius,\\nthe wife of Eumelus who lived in Pherae.\\nShe sent it to Odysseus’ house,\\nto make Penelope feel less distressed \\nand stop her tears of grief. It traveled through\\nthe latch’s thong, and in her bedroom stood\\nabove her head, and asked,\\n“Penelope,\\nAre you asleep? And are you still upset?\\nThe gods who live at ease have no desire\\nfor you to weep or worry. Know, your son\\nis coming home. He has not wronged the gods.”\\nIntelligent Penelope, still sleeping\\nsweetly inside the gates of dreams, replied,\\n“Sister, why have you come? Your house is far, \\nand you have never visited before.\\nYou tell me to stop grieving and not feel\\nthe many pains that prickle at my heart.\\nBut long ago I lost my lionhearted\\nhusband, a man more talented than any,\\nfamous throughout all Greece. Now my dear son\\nhas sailed oﬀ in a ship, though he knows nothing\\nof hardship and the world; he is a child.\\nI worry for him more than for his father.\\nI shudder, I am scared of what may happen, \\nat sea, or in the country that he went to.\\nHe has so many enemies; they plan\\nto murder him before he reaches home.”\\nThe misty phantom answered her, “Have courage.\\nLet not your heart be troubled or afraid.\\nHe has a goddess as his guide—Athena,\\na helper many men have prayed to have.\\nShe has great power. Pitying your grief,\\nshe sent me here to tell you all of this.”\\nCareful Penelope replied, “If you \\nare actually a god, with news from gods,\\ntell me about my husband too, poor man!\\nTell if he is alive and sees the sun,\\nor dead already in the house of Hades!”\\nThe spirit said, “I cannot tell you whether\\nhe is alive or dead. It is not good\\nto speak of things intangible as wind.”\\nWith that, the phantom floated through the air\\ninto the breeze. And then Penelope\\nwoke up from sleep, and she was glad at heart, \\nbecause she dreamed so clearly in the night.\\nThe suitors got on board and sailed across\\nthe water, set on murdering the boy.\\nThere is a rocky island out at sea,\\nin between Ithaca and craggy Same,\\ncalled Asteris—quite small but with a harbor\\nto shelter ships, and there they lurked in ambush.\\nBOOK \\nFrom the Goddess to the Storm\\nThen Dawn rose up from bed with Lord Tithonus,\\nto bring the light to deathless gods and mortals.\\nThe gods sat down for council, with the great\\nThunderlord Zeus. Athena was concerned\\nabout Odysseus’ many troubles,\\ntrapped by the nymph Calypso in her house.\\n“Father, and all immortal gods,” she said,\\n“No longer let a sceptered king be kind,\\nor gentle, or pay heed to right and wrong.\\nLet every king be cruel, his acts unjust! \\nOdysseus ruled gently, like a father,\\nbut no one even thinks about him now.\\nThe wretched man is stranded on an island;\\nCalypso forces him to stay with her.\\nHe cannot make his way back to his country.\\nHe has no ships, no oars, and no companions\\nto help him sail across the wide-backed sea.\\nHis son has gone for news of his lost father,\\nin sandy Pylos and in splendid Sparta;\\nthey plot to kill the boy when he returns!” \\nSmiling at her, Lord Zeus who heaps the clouds\\nreplied, “Ah, daughter! What a thing to say!\\nDid you not plan all this yourself, so that\\nOdysseus could come and take revenge\\nupon those suitors? Now use all your skill:\\nensure Telemachus comes safely home,\\nand that the suitors fail and sail away.”\\nThen turning to his son he said, “Dear Hermes,\\nyou are my messenger. Go tell the goddess\\nour fixed intention: that Odysseus \\nmust go back home—he has endured enough.\\nWithout a god or human as his guide,\\nhe will drift miserably for twenty days\\nupon a makeshift raft, and then arrive\\nat fertile Scheria. The magical\\nPhaeacians will respect him like a god,\\nand send him in a ship to his dear homeland,\\nwith gifts of bronze and heaps of gold and clothing,\\nmore than he would have brought with him from Troy\\nif he had come directly, with his share \\nof plunder. It is granted him to see\\nthe ones he loves, beneath his own high roof,\\nin his own country.”\\nHermes heard these words.\\nAt once he fastened on his feet the sandals\\nof everlasting gold with which he flies\\non breath of air across the sea and land;\\nhe seized the wand he uses to enchant\\nmen’s eyes to sleep or wake as he desires,\\nand flew. The god flashed bright in all his power.\\nHe touched Pieria, then from the sky \\nhe plunged into the sea and swooped between\\nthe waves, just like a seagull catching fish,\\nwetting its whirring wings in tireless brine.\\nSo Hermes scudded through the surging swell.\\nThen finally, he reached the distant island,\\nstepped from the indigo water to the shore,\\nand reached the cavern where the goddess lived.\\nThere sat Calypso with her braided curls.\\nBeside the hearth a mighty fire was burning.\\nThe scent of citrus and of brittle pine \\nsuﬀused the island. Inside, she was singing\\nand weaving with a shuttle made of gold.\\nHer voice was beautiful. Around the cave\\na luscious forest flourished: alder, poplar,\\nand scented cypress. It was full of wings.\\nBirds nested there but hunted out at sea:\\nthe owls, the hawks, the gulls with gaping beaks.\\nA ripe and luscious vine, hung thick with grapes,\\nwas stretched to coil around her cave. Four springs\\nspurted with sparkling water as they laced \\nwith crisscross currents intertwined together.\\nThe meadow softly bloomed with celery\\nand violets. He gazed around in wonder\\nand joy, at sights to please even a god.\\nEven the deathless god who once killed Argos\\nstood still, his heart amazed at all he saw.\\nAt last he went inside the cave. Calypso,\\nthe splendid goddess, knew the god on sight:\\nthe deathless gods all recognize each other,\\nhowever far away their homes may be. \\nBut Hermes did not find Odysseus,\\nsince he was sitting by the shore as usual,\\nsobbing in grief and pain; his heart was breaking.\\nIn tears he stared across the fruitless sea.\\nDivine Calypso told her guest to sit\\nupon a gleaming, glittering chair, and said,\\n“Dear friend, Lord Hermes of the golden wand,\\nwhy have you come? You do not often visit.\\nWhat do you have in mind? My heart inclines\\nto help you if I can, if it is fated. \\nFor now, come in, and let me make you welcome.”\\nAt that the goddess led him to a table\\nheaped with ambrosia, and she mixed a drink:\\nred nectar. So mercurial Hermes drank\\nand ate till he was satisfied, and then\\nthe diplomat explained why he had come.\\n“You are a goddess, I a god—and yet\\nyou ask why I am here. Well, I will tell you.\\nZeus ordered me to come—I did not want to.\\nWho would desire to cross such an expanse \\nof endless salty sea? No human town\\nis near here, where gods get fine sacrifices.\\nStill, none can sway or check the will of Zeus.\\nHe says the most unhappy man alive\\nis living here—a warrior from those\\nwho fought the town of Priam for nine years\\nand in the tenth they sacked it and sailed home.\\nBut on the journey back, they wronged Athena.\\nShe roused the wind and surging sea against them\\nand all his brave companions were destroyed, \\nwhile he himself was blown here by the waves.\\nZeus orders you to send him on his way\\nat once, since it is not his destiny\\nto die here far away from those he loves.\\nIt is his fate to see his family\\nand come back home, to his own native land.”\\nCalypso shuddered and let fly at him.\\n“You cruel, jealous gods! You bear a grudge\\nwhenever any goddess takes a man\\nto sleep with as a lover in her bed. \\nJust so the gods who live at ease were angry\\nwhen rosy-fingered Dawn took up Orion,\\nand from her golden throne, chaste Artemis\\nattacked and killed him with her gentle arrows.\\nDemeter with the cornrows in her hair\\nindulged her own desire, and she made love\\nwith Iasion in triple-furrowed fields—\\ntill Zeus found out, hurled flashing flame and killed him.\\nSo now, you male gods are upset with me\\nfor living with a man. A man I saved! \\nZeus pinned his ship and with his flash of lightning\\nsmashed it to pieces. All his friends were killed\\nout on the wine-dark sea. This man alone,\\nclutching the keel, was swept by wind and wave,\\nand came here, to my home. I cared for him\\nand loved him, and I vowed to set him free\\nfrom time and death forever. Still, I know\\nno other god can change the will of Zeus.\\nSo let him go, if that is Zeus’ order,\\nacross the barren sea. I will not give \\nan escort for this trip across the water;\\nI have no ships or rowers. But I will\\nshare what I know with him, and gladly give\\nuseful advice so he can safely reach\\nhis home.”\\nThe mediator, Zeus’ servant,\\nreplied, “Then send him now, avoid the wrath\\nof Zeus, do not enrage him, or one day\\nhis rage will hurt you.” With these words, he vanished.\\nAcknowledging the edict sent from Zeus,\\nthe goddess went to find Odysseus. \\nShe found him on the shore. His eyes were always\\ntearful; he wept sweet life away, in longing\\nto go back home, since she no longer pleased him.\\nHe had no choice. He spent his nights with her\\ninside her hollow cave, not wanting her\\nthough she still wanted him. By day he sat\\nout on the rocky beach, in tears and grief,\\nstaring in heartbreak at the fruitless sea.\\nThe goddess stood by him and said, “Poor man!\\nStop grieving, please. You need not waste your life. \\nI am quite ready now to send you oﬀ.\\nUsing your sword of bronze, cut trunks and build\\na raft, fix decks across, and let it take you\\nacross the misty sea. I will provide\\nwater, red wine, and food, to stop you starving,\\nand I will give you clothes, and send a wind\\nto blow you safely home, if this is what\\nthose sky gods want. They are more powerful\\nthan me; they get their way.”\\nOdysseus,\\ninformed by many years of pain and loss, \\nshuddered and let his words fly out at her.\\n“Goddess, you have some other scheme in mind,\\nnot my safe passage. You are telling me\\nto cross this vast and terrifying gulf,\\nin just a raft, when even stable schooners\\nsped on by winds from Zeus would not succeed?\\nNo, goddess, I will not get on a raft,\\nunless you swear to me a mighty oath\\nyou are not planning yet more pain for me.”\\nAt that, divine Calypso smiled at him. \\nShe reached out and caressed him with her hand,\\nsaying, “You scalawag! What you have said\\nshows that you understand how these things work.\\nBut by this earth, and by the sky above,\\nand by the waters of the Styx below,\\nwhich is the strongest oath for blessed gods,\\nI swear I will not plot more pain for you.\\nI have made plans for you as I would do\\nfor my own self, if I were in your place.\\nI am not made of iron; no, my heart \\nis kind and decent, and I pity you.”\\nAnd with those words, the goddess quickly turned\\nand led the way; he followed in her footsteps.\\nThey reached the cave together, man and goddess.\\nThe chair that Hermes had been sitting on\\nwas empty now; Odysseus sat there.\\nThe goddess gave him human food and drink.\\nShe sat and faced godlike Odysseus\\nwhile slave girls brought her nectar and ambrosia.\\nThey reached to take the good things set before them, \\nand satisfied their hunger and their thirst.\\nThe goddess-queen began. “Odysseus,\\nson of Laertes, blessed by Zeus—your plans\\nare always changing. Do you really want\\nto go back to that home you love so much?\\nWell then, good-bye! But if you understood\\nhow glutted you will be with suﬀering\\nbefore you reach your home, you would stay here\\nwith me and be immortal—though you might\\nstill wish to see that wife you always pine for. \\nAnd anyway, I know my body is\\nbetter than hers is. I am taller too.\\nMortals can never rival the immortals\\nin beauty.”\\nSo Odysseus, with tact,\\nsaid “Do not be enraged at me, great goddess.\\nYou are quite right. I know my modest wife\\nPenelope could never match your beauty.\\nShe is a human; you are deathless, ageless.\\nBut even so, I want to go back home,\\nand every day I hope that day will come. \\nIf some god strikes me on the wine-dark sea,\\nI will endure it. By now I am used\\nto suﬀering—I have gone through so much,\\nat sea and in the war. Let this come too.”\\nThe sun went down and brought the darkness on.\\nThey went inside the hollow cave and took\\nthe pleasure of their love, held close together.\\nWhen vernal Dawn first touched the sky with flowers,\\nthey rose and dressed: Odysseus put on\\nhis cloak and tunic, and Calypso wore \\nher fine long robe of silver. Round her waist\\nshe wrapped a golden belt, and veiled her head.\\nThen she prepared the journey for the man.\\nShe gave an axe that fitted in his grip,\\nits handle made of finest olive wood;\\nits huge bronze blade was sharp on either side.\\nShe also gave a polished adze. She led him\\nout to the island’s end, where tall trees grew:\\nblack poplar, alder, fir that touched the sky,\\ngood for a nimble boat of seasoned timber. \\nWhen she had shown him where the tall trees grew,\\nCalypso, queen of goddesses, went home.\\nOdysseus began and made good progress.\\nWith his bronze axe he cut down twenty trunks,\\npolished them skillfully and planed them straight.\\nCalypso brought a gimlet and he drilled\\nthrough every plank and fitted them together,\\nfixing it firm with pegs and fastenings.\\nAs wide as when a man who knows his trade\\nmarks out the curving hull to fit a ship, \\nso wide Odysseus marked out his raft.\\nHe notched the side decks to the close-set frame\\nand fixed long planks along the ribs to finish.\\nHe set a mast inside, and joined to it\\na yardarm and a rudder to steer straight.\\nHe heaped the boat with brush, and caulked the sides\\nwith wickerwork, to keep the water out.\\nCalypso brought him fabric for a sail,\\nand he constructed that with equal skill.\\nHe fastened up the braces, clews and halyards, \\nand using levers, launched her on the sea.\\nThe work had taken four days; on the fifth\\nCalypso let him go. She washed and dressed him\\nin clothes that smelled of incense. On the raft\\nshe put a flask of wine, a bigger flask\\nof water, and a large supply of food.\\nShe sent him oﬀ with gentle, lukewarm breezes.\\nGladly Odysseus spread out his sails\\nto catch the wind; with skill he steered the rudder.\\nNo sleep fell on his eyes; he watched the stars, \\nthe Pleiades, late-setting Bootes,\\nand Bear, which people also call the Plow,\\nwhich circles in one place, and marks Orion—\\nthe only star that has no share of Ocean.\\nCalypso, queen of goddesses, had told him\\nto keep the Bear on his left side while sailing.\\nHe sailed the sea for seven days and ten,\\nand on the eighteenth day, a murky mountain\\nof the Phaeacian land appeared—it rose\\nup like a shield beyond the misty sea. \\nReturning from the Ethiopians,\\nand pausing on Mount Solyma, Poseidon,\\nMaster of Earthquakes, saw the distant raft.\\nEnraged, he shook his head and told himself,\\n“This is outrageous! So it seems the gods\\nhave changed their plans about Odysseus\\nwhile I was absent! He has almost reached\\nPhaeacia, where it is his destiny\\nto flee the rope of pain that binds him now.\\nBut I will goad him to more misery, \\ntill he is sick of it.”\\nHe gathered up\\nthe clouds, and seized his trident and stirred round\\nthe sea and roused the gusts of every wind,\\nand covered earth and sea with fog. Night stretched\\nfrom heaven. Eurus, Notus, blasting Zephyr\\nand Boreas, the child of sky, all fell\\nand rolled a mighty wave. Odysseus\\ngrew weak at knees. He cried out in despair,\\n“More pain? How will it end? I am afraid\\nthe goddess spoke the truth: that I will have \\na sea of suﬀerings before I reach\\nmy homeland. It is coming true! Zeus whirls\\nthe air. Look at those clouds! He agitates\\nthe waves, as winds attack from all directions.\\nI can hold on to one thing: certain death.\\nThose Greeks were lucky, three and four times over,\\nwho died upon the plain of Troy to help\\nthe sons of Atreus. I wish I had\\ndied that same day the mass of Trojans hurled\\ntheir bronze-tipped spears at me around the corpse \\nof Peleus’ son. I would have had\\na funeral, and honor from the Greeks;\\nbut now I have to die this cruel death!”\\nA wave crashed onto him, and overturned\\nthe raft, and he fell out. The rudder slipped\\nout of his hands. The winds blew all directions\\nand one enormous gust snapped oﬀ the mast.\\nThe sail and yardarm drifted out to sea.\\nThen for a long time rushing, crashing waves\\nkept him submerged: he could not reach the surface. \\nThe clothes Calypso gave him weighed him down.\\nAt last he rose and spat the sour saltwater\\nout of his mouth—it gushed forth in a torrent.\\nDespite his pain and weakness, he remembered\\nhis raft, and lunged to get it through the waves;\\nhe climbed on top of it and clung to life.\\nThe great waves carried it this way and that.\\nAs when the thistles, clumping close together,\\nare borne across the prairie by the North Wind,\\nso these winds swept the raft across the sea. \\nThe South Wind hurls it, then the North Wind grabs it,\\nthen East Wind yields and lets the West Wind drive it.\\nBut stepping softly, Ino, the White Goddess,\\nCadmus’ child, once human, human-voiced,\\nnow honored with the gods in salty depths,\\nnoticed that he was suﬀering and lost,\\nwith pity. Like a gull with wings outstretched\\nshe rose up from the sea, sat on the raft\\nand said,\\n“Poor man! Why does enraged Poseidon\\ncreate an odyssey of pain for you? \\nBut his hostility will not destroy you.\\nYou seem intelligent. Do as I say.\\nStrip oﬀ your clothes and leave the raft behind\\nfor winds to take away. With just your arms\\nswim to Phaeacia. Fate decrees that there\\nyou will survive. Here, take my scarf and tie it\\nunder your chest: with this immortal veil,\\nyou need not be afraid of death or danger.\\nBut when you reach dry earth, untie the scarf\\nand throw it out to sea, away from land, \\nand turn away.” With that, the goddess gave it,\\nand plunged back down inside the surging sea,\\njust like a gull. The black wave covered her.\\nThe hero who had suﬀered so much danger\\nwas troubled and confused. He asked himself,\\n“Some deity has said to leave the raft.\\nBut what if gods are weaving tricks again?\\nI will not trust her yet: with my own eyes\\nI saw the land she said I should escape to,\\nand it is far away. I will do this: \\nas long as these wood timbers hold together,\\nI will hang on, however hard it is.\\nBut when the waves have smashed my raft to pieces,\\nthen I will have no choice, and I will swim.”\\nWhile he was thinking this, the Lord of Earthquakes,\\nPoseidon, roused a huge and dreadful wave\\nthat arched above his head: he hurled it at him.\\nAs when a fierce wind ruﬄes up a heap\\nof dry wheat chaﬀ; it scatters here and there;\\nso were the raft’s long timbers flung apart. \\nHe climbed astride a plank and rode along\\nas if on horseback. He took oﬀ the clothes\\nCalypso gave him, but he tied the scarf\\naround his chest, and dove into the sea,\\nspreading his arms to swim. The Lord of Earthquakes\\nsaw him and nodded, muttering, “At last\\nyou are in pain! Go drift across the sea,\\ntill you meet people blessed by Zeus, the Sky Lord.\\nBut even then, I think you will not lack\\nfor suﬀering.” He spurred his fine-maned horses, \\nand went to Aegae, where he had his home.\\nAthena, child of Zeus, devised a plan.\\nShe blocked the path of all the other winds,\\ntold them to cease and made them go to sleep,\\nbut roused swift Boreas and smoothed the waves\\nin front of him, so that Odysseus\\ncould reach Phaeacia and escape from death.\\nTwo days and nights he drifted on the waves:\\neach moment he expected he would die.\\nBut when the Dawn with dazzling braids brought day \\nfor the third time, the wind died down. No breeze,\\nbut total calm. As he was lifted up\\nby an enormous wave, he scanned around,\\nand saw the shore nearby. As when a father\\nlies sick and weak for many days, tormented\\nby some cruel spirit, till at last the gods\\nrestore him back to life; his children feel\\ngreat joy; Odysseus felt that same joy\\nwhen he saw land. He swam and longed to set\\nhis feet on earth. But when he was in earshot, \\nhe heard the boom of surf against the rocks.\\nThe mighty waves were crashing on the shore,\\na dreadful belching. Everything was covered\\nin salty foam. There were no sheltering harbors\\nfor ships, just sheer crags, reefs and solid cliﬀs.\\nOdysseus’ heart and legs gave way.\\nShaken but purposeful, he told himself,\\n“Zeus went beyond my hopes and let me see\\ndry land! I made it, cutting the abyss!\\nBut I see no way out from this gray sea. \\nThere are steep cliﬀs oﬀshore, and all around\\nthe rushing water roars; the rock runs sheer;\\nthe sea is deep near shore; there is no way\\nto set my feet on land without disaster.\\nIf I attempt to scramble out, a wave\\nwill seize and dash me on the jagged rock;\\na useless eﬀort. But if I swim on farther,\\nlooking for bays or coves or slanting beaches,\\nstorm winds may seize me once again and drag me,\\nhowling with grief, towards the fish-filled sea. \\nA god may even send a great sea-monster,\\nthe kind that famous Amphitrite rears.\\nI know Poseidon wants to do me harm.”\\nAs he was thinking this, the waves grew big\\nand hurled him at the craggy shore. His skin\\nwould have been ripped away, and his bones smashed,\\nhad not Athena given him a thought.\\nHe grabbed a rock as he was swept along\\nwith both hands, and clung to it, groaning, till\\nthe wave passed by. But then the swell rushed back, \\nand struck him hard and hurled him out to sea.\\nAs when an octopus, dragged from its den,\\nhas many pebbles sticking to its suckers,\\nso his strong hands were skinned against the rocks.\\nA mighty wave rolled over him again.\\nHe would have died too soon, in misery,\\nwithout the inspiration of Athena.\\nHe came up from the wave that spewed to shore\\nand swam towards the land, in search of beaches\\nwith gradual slopes, or inlets from the sea. \\nHe swam until he reached a river’s mouth\\nwith gentle waters; that place seemed ideal,\\nsmooth and not stony, sheltered from the wind.\\nHe sensed its current; in his heart he prayed,\\n“Unknown god, hear me! How I longed for you!\\nI have escaped the salt sea and Poseidon.\\nEven the deathless gods respect a man\\nwho is as lost as I am now. I have\\ngone through so much and reached your flowing\\nstreams.\\nPity me, lord! I am your supplicant.” \\nThe current ceased; the River God restrained\\nthe waves and made them calm. He brought him safe\\ninto the river mouth. His legs cramped up;\\nthe sea had broken him. His swollen body\\ngushed brine from mouth and nostrils. There he lay,\\nwinded and silent, hardly fit to move.\\nA terrible exhaustion overcame him.\\nWhen he could breathe and think again, he took\\nthe goddess’ scarf oﬀ, and let it go\\ninto the river flowing to the sea; \\nstrong currents swept it down and Ino’s hands\\ntook it. He crawled on land and crouched beside\\nthe reeds and bent to kiss life-giving earth,\\nand trembling, he spoke to his own heart.\\n“What now? What will become of me? If I\\nstay up all wretched night beside this river,\\nthe cruel frost and gentle dew together\\nmay finish me: my life is thin with weakness.\\nAt dawn a cold breeze blows beside the river.\\nBut if I climb the slope to those dark woods \\nand go to rest in that thick undergrowth,\\nletting sweet sleep take hold of me, and losing\\nmy cold and weariness—wild beasts may find me\\nand treat me as their prey.”\\nBut he decided\\nto go into the woods. He found a place\\nbeside a clearing, near the water’s edge.\\nHe crawled beneath two bushes grown together,\\nof thorn and olive. No strong wet wind could blow\\nthrough them, no shining sunbeam ever strike them,\\nno rain could penetrate them; they were growing \\nso thickly intertwined. Odysseus\\ncrept under, and he scraped a bed together,\\nof leaves: there were enough to cover two\\nagainst the worst of winter. Seeing this,\\nthe hero who had suﬀered for so long\\nwas happy. He lay down inside and heaped\\nmore leaves on top. As when a man who lives\\nout on a lonely farm that has no neighbors\\nburies a glowing torch inside black embers\\nto save the seed of fire and keep a source— \\nso was Odysseus concealed in leaves.\\nAthena poured down sleep to shut his eyes\\nso all his painful weariness could end.\\nBOOK \\nA Princess and Her Laundry\\nOdysseus had suﬀered. In exhaustion\\nfrom all his long ordeals, the hero slept.\\nMeanwhile, Athena went to the Phaeacians.\\nThis people used to live in Hyperia,\\na land of dancing. But their mighty neighbors,\\nthe Cyclopes, kept looting them, and they\\ncould not hold out. Their king, Nausithous,\\nbrought them to Scheria, a distant place,\\nand built a wall around the town, and homes,\\nand temples to the gods, and plots of land. \\nHe went to Hades. Then Alcinous,\\nwho has god-given wisdom, came to power.\\nBright-eyed Athena traveled to his palace,\\nto help Odysseus’ journey home.\\nShe went inside the decorated bedroom\\nwhere the young princess, Nausicaa, was sleeping,\\nas lovely as a goddess. Slaves were sleeping\\noutside her doorway, one on either side;\\ntwo charming girls with all the Graces’ gifts.\\nThe shining doors were shut, but like the wind \\nthe goddess reached the bed of Nausicaa,\\ndisguised as her best friend, a girl her age,\\nthe daughter of the famous sailor Dymas.\\nSharp-eyed Athena said,\\n“Oh, Nausicaa!\\nSo lazy! But your mother should have taught you!\\nYour clothes are lying there in dirty heaps,\\nthough you will soon be married, and you need\\na pretty dress to wear, and clothes to give\\nto all your bridesmaids. That impresses people,\\nand makes the parents happy. When day comes, \\nwe have to do the laundry. I will come\\nand help you, so the work will soon be done.\\nSurely you will not long remain unmarried.\\nThe best young men here in your native land\\nalready want to court you. So at dawn\\ngo ask your father for the cart with mules,\\nto carry dresses, scarves, and sheets. You should\\nride there, not walk; the washing pools are far\\nfrom town.”\\nThe goddess looked into her eyes,\\nthen went back to Olympus, which they say \\nis where the gods will have their home forever.\\nThe place is never shaken by the wind,\\nor wet with rain or blanketed by snow.\\nA cloudless sky is spread above the mountain,\\nwhite radiance all round. The blessed gods\\nlive there in happiness forevermore.\\nThen Dawn came from her lovely throne, and woke\\nthe girl. She was amazed, remembering\\nher dream, and in a fine dress, went to tell\\nher parents, whom she found inside the hall. \\nHer mother sat beside the hearth and spun\\nsea-purpled yarn, her house girls all around her.\\nHer father was just heading out to council\\nwith his renowned advisors, since his people\\nhad called him to a meeting. She stood near him\\nand said,\\n“Dear Daddy, please would you set up\\nthe wagon with the big smooth wheels for me,\\nso I can take my fine clothes to the river\\nto wash them? They are dirty. And you too\\nshould wear clean clothes for meeting your advisors, \\ndressed in your best to make important plans.\\nYour five sons also—two of whom are married,\\nbut three are strapping single men—they always\\nwant to wear nice fresh-laundered clothes when they\\nare going dancing. This is on my mind.”\\nShe said this since she felt too shy to talk\\nof marriage to her father. But he knew,\\nand answered, “Child, I would not grudge the mules\\nor anything you want. Go on! The slaves\\ncan fit the wagon with its cargo rack.” \\nHe called the household slaves, and they obeyed.\\nThey made the wagon ready and inspected\\nits wheels, led up the mules, and yoked them to it.\\nThe girl brought out the multicolored clothes,\\nand put them on the cart, while in a basket\\nher mother packed nutritious food for her—\\na varied meal, with olives, cheese, and wine,\\nstored in a goatskin. Then the girl got in.\\nHer mother handed her a golden flask\\nof oil, to use when she had had her bath. \\nThen Nausicaa took up the whip and reins,\\nand cracked the whip. The mules were on their way,\\neager to go and rattling the harness,\\nbringing the clothes and girl and all her slaves.\\nThey reached the lovely river where the pools\\nare always full—the water flows in streams\\nand bubbles up from underneath, to wash\\neven the dirtiest of laundry. There\\nthey freed the mules and drove them to the river\\nto graze on honeyed grass beside the stream. \\nThe girls brought out the laundry from the cart,\\nand brought it to the washing pools and trod it,\\ncompeting with each other. When the dirt\\nwas gone, they spread the clothes along the shore,\\nwhere salt sea washes pebbles to the beach.\\nThey bathed and rubbed themselves with olive oil.\\nThen they sat on the riverbank and ate,\\nand waited for the sun to dry the clothes.\\nBut when they finished eating, they took oﬀ\\ntheir head-scarves to play ball. The white-armed princess\\n\\nled them in play—like Artemis the archer,\\nrunning across the heights of Taygetus\\nand Erymanthus; she is glad to run\\nwith boars and fleet-foot deer. The rustic daughters\\nof Zeus the Aegis King play round about her,\\nwhile Leto is delighted in her heart,\\nseeing her daughter far above the rest,\\nthough all are beautiful. So Nausicaa\\nstood out above them all. But when the girl\\nwas thinking she should head for home and yoke \\nthe mules, and pack the laundry up again,\\nAthena’s eyes flashed bright. Odysseus\\nmust wake up, see the pretty girl, and have\\nan escort to the town of the Phaeacians.\\nThe princess threw the ball towards a slave girl,\\nwho missed the catch. It fell down in an eddy;\\nthe girls all started screaming, very loudly.\\nOdysseus woke up, and thought things over.\\n“What is this country I have come to now?\\nAre all the people wild and violent, \\nor good, hospitable, and god-fearing?\\nI heard the sound of female voices. Is it\\nnymphs, who frequent the craggy mountaintops,\\nand river streams and meadows lush with grass?\\nOr could this noise I hear be human voices?\\nI have to try to find out who they are.”\\nOdysseus jumped up from out the bushes.\\nGrasping a leafy branch he broke it oﬀ\\nto cover up his manly private parts.\\nJust as a mountain lion trusts its strength, \\nand beaten by the rain and wind, its eyes\\nburn bright as it attacks the cows or sheep,\\nor wild deer, and hunger drives it on\\nto try the sturdy pens of sheep—so need\\nimpelled Odysseus to come upon\\nthe girls with pretty hair, though he was naked.\\nAll caked with salt, he looked a dreadful sight.\\nThey ran along the shore quite terrified,\\nsome here, some there. But Nausicaa stayed still.\\nAthena made her legs stop trembling \\nand gave her courage in her heart. She stood there.\\nHe wondered, should he touch her knees, or keep\\nsome distance and use charming words, to beg\\nthe pretty girl to show him to the town,\\nand give him clothes. At last he thought it best\\nto keep some distance and use words to beg her.\\nThe girl might be alarmed at being touched.\\nHis words were calculated flattery.\\n“My lady, please! Are you divine or human?\\nIf you are some great goddess from the sky, \\nyou look like Zeus’ daughter Artemis—\\nyou are as tall and beautiful as she.\\nBut if you live on earth and are a human,\\nyour mother and your father must be lucky,\\nyour brothers also—lucky three times over.\\nTheir hearts must be delighted, seeing you,\\ntheir flourishing new sprout, the dancers’ leader.\\nAnd that man will be luckiest by far,\\nwho takes you home with dowry, as his bride.\\nI have seen no one like you. Never, no one. \\nMy eyes are dazzled when I look at you.\\nI traveled once to Delos, on my way\\nto war and suﬀering; my troops marched with me.\\nBeside Apollo’s altar sprang a sapling,\\na fresh young palm. I gazed at it and marveled.\\nI never saw so magical a tree.\\nMy lady, you transfix me that same way.\\nI am in awe of you, afraid to touch\\nyour knees. But I am desperate. I came from\\nOgygia, and for twenty days storm winds \\nand waves were driving me, adrift until\\nyesterday some god washed me up right here,\\nperhaps to meet more suﬀering. I think\\nmy troubles will not end until the gods\\nhave done their all. My lady, pity me.\\nBattered and wrecked, I come to you, you first—\\nand I know no one else in this whole country.\\nShow me the town, give me some rags to wear,\\nif you brought any clothes when you came here.\\nSo may the gods grant all your heart’s desires, \\na home and husband, somebody like-minded.\\nFor nothing could be better than when two\\nlive in one house, their minds in harmony,\\nhusband and wife. Their enemies are jealous,\\ntheir friends delighted, and they have great honor.”\\nThen white-armed Nausicaa replied, “Well, stranger,\\nyou seem a brave and clever man; you know\\nthat Zeus apportions happiness to people,\\nto good and bad, each one as he decides.\\nYour troubles come from him, and you must bear them. \\nBut since you have arrived here in our land,\\nyou will not lack for clothes or anything\\na person needs in times of desperation.\\nI will show you the town. The people here\\nare called Phaeacians, and I am the daughter\\nof the great King Alcinous, on whom\\ndepends the strength and power of our people.”\\nAnd then she called her slaves with braided hair.\\n“Wait, girls! Why are you running from this man?\\nDo you believe he is an enemy? \\nNo living person ever born would come\\nto our Phaeacia with a hostile mind,\\nsince we are much beloved by the gods.\\nOur island is remote, washed round by sea;\\nwe have no human contact. But this man\\nis lost, poor thing. We must look after him.\\nAll foreigners and beggars come from Zeus,\\nand any act of kindness is a blessing.\\nSo give the stranger food and drink, and wash him\\ndown in the river, sheltered from the wind.” \\nThey stopped, and egged each other on to take\\nOdysseus to shelter, as the princess,\\nthe daughter of Alcinous, had told them.\\nThey gave him clothes, a tunic and a cloak,\\nthe olive oil in the golden flask,\\nand led him down to wash beside the river.\\nOdysseus politely said,\\n“Now, girls,\\nwait at a distance here, so I can wash\\nmy grimy back, and rub myself with oil—\\nit has been quite a while since I have done it. \\nPlease let me wash in private. I am shy\\nof being naked with you—pretty girls\\nwith lovely hair.”\\nSo they withdrew, and told\\ntheir mistress. Then he used the river water\\nto scrub the brine oﬀ from his back and shoulders,\\nand wash the crusty sea salt from his hair.\\nBut when he was all clean and richly oiled,\\ndressed in the clothes the young unmarried girl\\nhad given him, Athena made him look\\nbigger and sturdier, and made his hair \\ngrow curling tendrils like a hyacinth.\\nAs when Athena and Hephaestus teach\\na knowledgeable craftsman every art,\\nand he pours gold on silver, making objects\\nmore beautiful—just so Athena poured\\nattractiveness across his head and shoulders.\\nThen he went oﬀ and sat beside the sea;\\nhis handsomeness was dazzling. The girl\\nwas shocked. She told her slaves with tidy hair,\\n“Now listen to me, girls! The gods who live \\non Mount Olympus must have wished this man\\nto come in contact with my godlike people.\\nBefore, he looked so poor and unrefined;\\nnow he is like a god that lives in heaven.\\nI hope I get a man like this as husband,\\na man that lives here and would like to stay.\\nBut, girls, now give the stranger food and drink!”\\nShe gave her orders and the girls obeyed—\\nthey gave Odysseus some food and drink.\\nHe wolfed the food and drank. He was half starved; \\nit had been ages since he tasted food.\\nThen white-armed Nausicaa had formed a plan.\\nFolding the clothes, she packed them in the wagon,\\nand yoked the mules, and then she climbed inside.\\nShe gave Odysseus some clear instructions.\\n“Stranger, get ready; you must go to town,\\nand I will have you meet the best of all\\nour people. You seem smart; do as I say.\\nWhile we are passing through the fields and farmlands,\\nyou have to follow quickly with the girls \\nbehind the mules, and let me lead the way.\\nThen we will reach the lofty city wall,\\nwhich has a scenic port on either side,\\nand one slim gate, where curved ships are drawn up\\nalong the road: a special spot for each.\\nThe meeting place surrounds Poseidon’s shrine,\\nfitted with heavy stones set deep in earth.\\nAnd there the workers make the ships’ equipment—\\ncables and sails—and there they plane the oars.\\nPhaeacians do not care for archery; \\ntheir passion is for sails and oars and ships,\\non which they love to cross the dark-gray ocean.\\nThe people in the town are proud; I worry\\nthat they may speak against me. Someone rude\\nmay say, ‘Who is that big strong man with her?\\nWhere did she find that stranger? Will he be\\nher husband? She has got him from a ship,\\na foreigner, since no one lives near here,\\nor else a god, the answer to her prayers,\\ndescended from the sky to hold her tight. \\nBetter if she has found herself a man\\nfrom elsewhere, since she scorns the people here,\\nalthough she has so many noble suitors.’\\nSo they will shame me. I myself would blame\\na girl who got too intimate with men\\nbefore her marriage, and who went against\\nher loving parents’ rules. But listen, stranger,\\nI will explain the quickest way to gain\\nmy father’s help to make your way back home.\\nBeside the road there is a grove of poplars; \\nit has a fountain, and a meadow round it.\\nIt is Athena’s place, where Father has\\nhis orchard and estate, as far from town\\nas human voice can carry. Sit down there\\nand wait until I reach my father’s house\\nin town. But when you think I have arrived,\\nwalk on and ask directions for the palace\\nof King Alcinous, my mighty father.\\nIt will be very easy finding it;\\na tiny child could guide you there. It is \\nunlike the other houses in Phaeacia.\\nGo through the courtyard, in the house and on\\nstraight to the Great Hall. You will find my mother\\nsitting beside the hearth by firelight,\\nand spinning her amazing purple wool.\\nShe leans against a pillar, slaves behind her.\\nMy father has a throne right next to hers;\\nhe sits and sips his wine, just like a god.\\nBut pass him by, embrace my mother’s knees\\nto supplicate. If you do this, you quickly \\nwill reach your home, however far it is,\\nin happiness. If she is good to you,\\nand looks upon you kindly in her heart,\\nyou can be sure of getting to your house,\\nback to your family and native land.”\\nWith that, she used her shining whip to urge\\nthe mules to go. They left the river streams,\\nand trotted well and clipped their hooves along.\\nShe drove an easy pace to let her slaves\\nand great Odysseus keep up on foot. \\nThe sun was setting when they reached the grove,\\nthe famous sanctuary of Athena.\\nOdysseus sat in it, and at once\\nhe prayed to mighty Zeus’ daughter.\\n“Hear me,\\ndaughter of Zeus! Unvanquished Queen! If ever,\\nwhen that earth-shaker god was wrecking me,\\nyou helped me—may they pity me and give me\\nkind welcome in Phaeacia.” And Athena\\nheard him but did not yet appear to him,\\nrespecting her own brother in his fury \\nagainst Odysseus till he reached home.\\nBOOK \\nA Magical Kingdom\\nOdysseus sat patiently and prayed.\\nMeanwhile, the fine strong mules conveyed the girl\\nto town; she reached her father’s palace gate.\\nHer brothers gathered round her like immortals.\\nThey took the harness oﬀ the mules and brought\\nthe clothes inside. She went to her own room.\\nEurymedusa, her old slave, had lit\\na fire for her. This woman had been brought\\nfrom Apeire by ship, long years before.\\nThe people chose to give her to the king, \\nbecause they bowed before him like a god.\\nShe used to babysit young Nausicaa,\\nand now she lit her fire and cooked her meal.\\nOdysseus walked briskly to the town.\\nAthena helpfully surrounded him\\nwith mist that kept him safe him from rude remarks\\nfrom people who might ask him who he was.\\nWhen he had almost reached the lovely city,\\nbright-eyed Athena met him, like a girl,\\nyoung and unmarried, with a water pitcher. \\nShe stopped in front of him. Odysseus\\nsaid,\\n“Child, would you escort me to the house\\nof King Alcinous, who rules this land?\\nI have been through hard times. I traveled here\\nfrom far away; I am a foreigner,\\nand I know no one who lives here in town\\nor anywhere round here.”\\nWith twinkling eyes\\nthe goddess answered, “Mr. Foreigner,\\nI will take you to where you want to go.\\nThe king lives near my father’s home. But you \\nmust walk in silence. Do not look at people,\\nand ask no questions. People here are not\\ntoo keen on strangers coming from abroad,\\nalthough they like to cross the sea themselves.\\nThey know their ships go very fast. Poseidon\\ngave them this gift. Their boats can fly like wings,\\nor quick as thoughts.”\\nThe goddess led him there.\\nHe followed closely in her skipping steps.\\nThe seafaring Phaeacians did not see him\\nas he passed through the town, since that great\\ngoddess, \\npigtailed Athena, in her care for him\\nmade him invisible with magic mist.\\nHe was amazed to see the ships and harbors\\nand meeting places of the noblemen,\\nand high walls set with stakes on top—a wonder!\\nThey reached the splendid palace of the king.\\nDivine Athena winked at him and said,\\n“Here, Mr. Foreigner, this is the house\\nyou wanted me to take you to. You will\\nfind them, the king and queen, inside at dinner. \\nDo not be scared; go in. The brave succeed\\nin all adventures, even those who come\\nfrom countries far away. First greet the queen.\\nArete is her name. The king and queen\\nhave common ancestry—Nausithous.\\nEurymedon was long ago the king\\nover the Giants, who were proud and bad.\\nHe killed them, his own people, and then he\\ngot killed as well. His youngest daughter was\\nnamed Periboea. She was very pretty. \\nPoseidon slept with her. She had a child,\\nNausithous, and he became the king\\nhere in Phaeacia, and he had two sons,\\nour King Alcinous, and Rhexenor.\\nApollo shot that Rhexenor when he\\nwas newly married, with no son. He left\\na daughter, our Arete, and her uncle,\\nAlcinous, made her his wife. No woman\\nis honored as he honors her. She is\\nprecious to him, her children, and the people. \\nWe look at her as if she were a goddess,\\nand point her out when she walks through our town.\\nShe is extremely clever and perceptive;\\nshe solves disputes to help the men she likes.\\nIf she looks on you kindly in her heart,\\nyou have a chance of seeing those you love,\\nand getting back again to your big house\\nand homeland.”\\nSo bright-eyed Athena left him.\\nShe went from lovely Scheria, across\\nthe tireless sea, to Marathon and Athens, \\nand went inside Erechtheus’ palace.\\nOdysseus approached the royal house,\\nand stood there by the threshold made of bronze.\\nHis heart was mulling over many things.\\nThe palace of the mighty king was high,\\nand shone like rays of sunlight or of moonlight.\\nThe walls were bronze all over, from the entrance\\nback to the bedrooms, and along them ran\\na frieze of blue. Gold doors held safe the house.\\nPillars of silver rose up from the threshold, \\nthe lintel silver, and the handle, gold.\\nSilver and golden dogs stood at each side,\\nmade by Hephaestus with great artistry,\\nto guard the home of brave Alcinous—\\nimmortal dogs, unaging for all time.\\nAt intervals were seats set in the walls,\\nright from the doorway to the inner rooms,\\nwith soft embroidered throws, the work of women.\\nPhaeacian lords and ladies sat upon them,\\neating and drinking, since they lacked for nothing. \\nBoys made of gold were set on pedestals,\\nand they held burning torches in their hands,\\nlighting the hall at night for those at dinner.\\nThe King had fifty slave girls in his house;\\nsome ground the yellow grain upon the millstone,\\nothers wove cloth and sat there spinning yarn,\\nwith fingers quick as rustling poplar leaves,\\nand oil was dripping from the woven fabric.\\nJust as Phaeacian men have special talent\\nfor launching ships to sea, the women there \\nare expert weavers, since Athena gave them\\nfine minds and skill to make most lovely things.\\nOutside the courtyard by the doors there grows\\nan orchard of four acres, hedged around.\\nThe trees are tall, luxuriant with fruit:\\nbright-colored apples, pears and pomegranate,\\nsweet figs and fertile olives, and the crop\\nnever runs out or withers in the winter,\\nnor in the summer. Fruit grows all year round.\\nThe West Wind always blows and makes it swell \\nand ripen: mellowing pear on mellowing pear,\\napple on apple, grapes on grapes, and figs.\\nA fertile vineyard too is planted there.\\nThey use the warmer side, a flattened slope,\\nfor drying grapes in sunshine. They pick bunches\\nand trample them, while unripe clusters open\\nand shed their blooms, and others turn to purple.\\nThere are two springs: one flows all through the garden,\\nthe other gushes from the courtyard threshold,\\ntowards the palace, and the people draw \\nfreshwater. So the gods had blessed the house\\nof King Alcinous with lovely gifts.\\nHardened, long-suﬀering Odysseus\\nstood there and stared, astonished in his heart,\\nthen quickly strode across the palace threshold.\\nHe found the lordly leaders of Phaeacia\\npouring drink oﬀerings for sharp-eyed Hermes,\\nto whom they give libations before bed.\\nOdysseus went in the house disguised\\nin mist with which Athena covered him, \\nuntil he reached Arete and the king.\\nHe threw his arms around Arete’s knees,\\nand all at once, the magic mist dispersed.\\nThey were astonished when they saw the man,\\nand all fell silent. Then Odysseus\\nsaid,\\n“Queen Arete, child of Rhexenor,\\nI have had many years of pain and loss.\\nI beg you, and your husband, and these men\\nwho feast here—may the gods bless you in life,\\nand may you leave your children wealth and honor. \\nNow help me, please, to get back home, and quickly!\\nI miss my family. I have been gone\\nso long it hurts.”\\nHe sat down by the hearth\\namong the ashes of the fire. They all\\nwere silent till Echeneus spoke up.\\nHe was an elder statesman of Phaeacia,\\na skillful orator and learned man.\\nWanting to help, he said,\\n“Alcinous,\\nyou know it is not right to leave a stranger\\nsitting there on the floor beside the hearth \\namong the cinders. Everyone is waiting\\nfor you to give the word. Make him get up,\\nand seat him on a silver chair, and order\\nwine to be poured, so we may make libations\\nto Zeus the Thunderlord, who loves the needy.\\nThe house girl ought to bring the stranger food\\nout from the storeroom.”\\nSo Alcinous\\nreached for Odysseus’ hand, and raised\\nthe many-minded hero from the ashes.\\nHe made Laodamas, his favorite son, \\nvacate his chair so he could sit beside him.\\nThe slave girl brought him water in a pitcher\\nof gold to wash his hands, and poured it out\\nover a silver bowl, and fetched a table\\nof polished wood; a humble slave brought out\\nbread and an ample plateful of the meat.\\nHalf-starved and weak, the hero ate and drank.\\nMajestic King Alcinous addressed\\nPontonous, the wine boy.\\n“Go and mix\\na bowl and serve the wine to all our guests, \\nso we may oﬀer drink to thundering Zeus\\nwho blesses those in need.” The boy mixed up\\nthe sweet, delicious wine, and filled the cups\\nfor everyone, with first pour for the gods.\\nThey made the oﬀerings and drank as much\\nas they desired, and then Alcinous\\nsaid,\\n“Listen, lords. Hear what my heart commands.\\nThe feast is over; go home, go to bed.\\nAt dawn, we will call more of our best men,\\nand host the stranger in our halls, and oﬀer \\nfine sacrifices to the gods, then plan\\nhow we may help his journey, so our guest\\nmay travel quickly, without pain or trouble,\\nencountering no trouble on the way,\\nhowever far away it is, until\\nhe reaches home. Once there, he must endure\\nwhatever was spun out when he was born\\nby Fate and by the heavy ones, the Spinners.\\nBut if he is immortal, come from heaven,\\nthe gods have changed their ways, since in the past \\nthey used to show themselves to us directly\\nwhenever we would give them hecatombs.\\nThey sit and eat among us. Even if\\njust one of us meets them alone, out walking,\\nthey do not hide from us; we are close friends,\\nas are the Giants and Cyclopic peoples.”\\nOdysseus, with careful calculation,\\nsaid,\\n“No, Alcinous, please think again.\\nI am not like the deathless gods in heaven.\\nMy height is normal. I look like a human. \\nIn pain I am a match for any man,\\nwhoever you may know that suﬀers most.\\nI could tell many stories of the dangers\\nthat I have suﬀered through; gods willed it so.\\nBut let me have my meal, despite my grief.\\nThe belly is just like a whining dog:\\nit begs and forces one to notice it,\\ndespite exhaustion or the depths of sorrow.\\nMy heart is full of sorrow, but my stomach\\nis always telling me to eat and drink. \\nIt tells me to forget what I have suﬀered,\\nand fill it up. At dawn tomorrow, help me\\nto reach my homeland, after all this pain.\\nMay I live out my final days in sight\\nof my own property and slaves and home.”\\nThey all agreed the stranger’s words made sense,\\nand that he should be sent back home. They poured\\ndrink oﬀerings to the gods, and drank as much\\nas they desired, then all went home to bed.\\nOdysseus was left there in the hall, \\nsitting beside Arete and the godlike\\nAlcinous. The dishes from the feast\\nwere cleaned up by the slaves. White-armed Arete\\nhad noticed his fine clothes, the cloak and shirt\\nshe wove herself, with help from her slave girls.\\nHer words flew out to him as if on wings.\\n“Stranger, let me be first to speak to you.\\nWhere are you from? And who gave you those clothes?\\nI thought you said you drifted here by sea?”\\nPlanning his words with careful skill, he answered, \\n“It would be diﬃcult, Your Majesty,\\nto tell it all; the gods have given me\\nso many troubles. I will tell you this.\\nThere is an island, far out in the sea,\\nOgygia, where the child of Atlas lives,\\nthe mighty goddess with smooth braids, the crafty\\nCalypso, friend to neither gods nor mortals.\\nA spirit brought me to her hearth, alone,\\nwhen Zeus scooped up my ship and with bright lightning\\nsplit it apart across the wine-dark sea. \\nAll of my comrades, my brave friends, were killed.\\nI wrapped my arms around the keel and floated\\nfor ten days. On the tenth black night, the gods\\ncarried me till I reached Ogygia,\\nhome of the beautiful and mighty goddess\\nCalypso. Lovingly she cared for me,\\nvowing to set me free from death and time\\nforever. But she never swayed my heart.\\nI stayed for seven years; she gave me clothes\\nlike those of gods, but they were always wet \\nwith tears. At last the eighth year rolled around,\\nand word came down from Zeus that I must go,\\nand finally her mind was changed. She sent me\\nupon a well-bound wooden raft, equipped\\nwith food, sweet wine, and clothes as if for gods,\\nand sent a fair warm wind. I sailed the sea\\nfor seventeen long days; on day eighteen,\\nthe murky mountains of your land appeared,\\nand I was overjoyed, but more bad luck\\nwas hurled at me. Poseidon roused the winds \\nto block me, and he stirred the sea. I sobbed,\\nand clung there, going nowhere, till my raft\\nwas smashed to pieces by the massive storm.\\nBut I swam through this gulf of water till\\nthe current brought me here. If I had tried\\nto land at once, I would have been swept back\\nagainst the crags. I swam a way away,\\nuntil I reached a river mouth, which seemed\\na perfect spot for landing: it was sheltered\\nfrom wind, and smooth, quite free from rocks. So there \\nI flopped and tried to gather up my strength\\nuntil the holy nightfall. Then I crawled\\nout of the rain-fed river to the bank,\\nand hid inside the bushes, and I heaped\\nsome leaves to cover me. Some god poured down\\ndeep sleep. With heavy heart I slept all night\\nand through the dawn to noon, beneath the leaves.\\nThen in the afternoon, when sleep released me,\\nI woke, and saw girls playing on the beach—\\nyour daughter, like a goddess, and her slaves. \\nI prayed to her. One would not think a girl\\nas young as her would have so much good sense;\\nyoung people are not usually so thoughtful.\\nShe was so kind to me; she gave me food\\nand wine, and had them wash me in the river,\\nand let me have these clothes. Now I have told you\\nthe truth, no matter what.”\\nAlcinous\\nsaid, “Just one of these things that my daughter did\\nwas not correct: she should have brought you here\\nto us herself, escorted by her slave girls, \\nsince you had supplicated first to her.”\\nWith careful tact Odysseus replied,\\n“Your daughter is quite wonderful, great king.\\nPlease do not blame her. She told me to come\\nhere with her slaves, but I was too embarrassed,\\nand nervous. I thought you might get annoyed\\nat seeing me. We humans on this earth\\nare apt to be suspicious.”\\nAnd the king\\nreplied, “My heart is not the type to feel\\nanger for no good reason. Moderation \\nis always best. Athena, Zeus, Apollo,\\nwhat a congenial man you are! I wish\\nyou would stay here, and marry my own daughter,\\nand be my son. I would give you a home\\nand wealth if you would like to stay. If not,\\nwe will not keep you here against your will.\\nMay Zeus not have it so! As for your journey,\\nI give my word that you can go tomorrow.\\nLying down, lulled to sleep, you will be rowed\\nacross the peaceful sea until you reach \\nyour land and home, or anywhere you want,\\neven beyond Euboea, which our people\\nsaw when they carried fair-haired Rhadamanthus\\nto visit Tityus, the son of Gaia.\\nIt is supposed to be the farthest shore\\non earth, but they were there and back that day,\\nnot even tired. That shows just how fine\\nmy ships are, and my men who stir the sea\\nwith oars.”\\nAt that Odysseus, who had\\nendured so much, was happy, and he prayed, \\n“O Father Zeus, may everything come true,\\njust as Alcinous has said. So may\\nhis fame burn bright forever on the earth,\\nand may I reach my home.”\\nThen at these words,\\nwhite-armed Arete called to her attendants\\nto put a bed out on the porch and lay\\nfine purple blankets on it and to spread\\ncovers and woolly quilts across the top.\\nWith torches in their hands they bustled out.\\nThey made the bed up neatly, very fast, \\nthen came and called Odysseus.\\n“Now guest,\\nget up and come outside, your bed is ready.”\\nOdysseus was glad to go to sleep\\nafter his long adventures, on that bed\\nsurrounded by the rustling of the porch.\\nAlcinous was sleeping in his room,\\nbeside his wife, who made their bed and shared it.\\nBOOK \\nThe Songs of a Poet\\nSoon Dawn appeared and touched the sky with roses.\\nMajestic, holy King Alcinous\\nleapt out of bed, as did Odysseus,\\nthe city-sacker. Then the blessed king,\\nmighty Alcinous, led out his guest\\nto the Phaeacian council by the ships.\\nThey sat there side by side on polished stones.\\nMeanwhile, Athena walked all through the town,\\nappearing like the royal messenger.\\nTo help Odysseus’ journey home, \\nshe stood beside each man in turn and said,\\n“My lord, come to the meeting place, to learn\\nabout the visitor to our king’s home.\\nDespite his wanderings by sea, he looks\\nlike an immortal god.”\\nSo she roused up\\nthe hearts and minds of each, and soon the seats\\nof council were filled up; the men assembled.\\nSeeing Laertes’ clever son, the crowd\\nmarveled. Athena poured unearthly charm\\nupon his head and shoulders, and she made him \\ntaller and sturdier, so these Phaeacians\\nwould welcome and respect him, when he managed\\nthe many trials of skill that they would set\\nto test him. When the people were assembled,\\nAlcinous addressed them.\\n“Hear me, leaders\\nand chieftains of Phaeacia. I will tell you\\nthe promptings of my heart. This foreigner—\\nI do not know his name—came wandering\\nfrom west or east and showed up at my house.\\nHe begs and prays for help to travel on. \\nLet us assist him, as we have before\\nwith other guests: no visitor has ever\\nbeen forced to linger in my house. We always\\ngive them safe passage home. Now let us launch\\na ship for her maiden voyage on the water,\\nand choose a crew of fifty-two, the men\\nselected as the best, and lash the oars\\nbeside the benches. Then return to shore,\\nand come to my house. Let the young men hurry\\nto cook a feast. I will provide supplies, \\nplenty for everyone. And I invite\\nyou also, lords, to welcome him with me.\\nDo not refuse! We also must invite\\nDemodocus, the poet. Gods inspire him,\\nso any song he chooses to perform\\nis wonderful to hear.”\\nHe led the way.\\nThe lords went with him, and the house boy fetched\\nthe bard. The fifty-two select young men\\nwent to the shore, just as the king commanded.\\nThey reached the restless salty sea, and launched \\nthe black ship on the depths, set up the mast\\nand sails, and fastened in the oars, by tying\\neach to its leather thole-strap, all in order.\\nThey spread the white sails wide, and moored the ship\\nout in the water. Then the men walked up\\ntowards the mighty palace of the king.\\nThe halls and porticoes were thronged with people,\\nboth old and young. To feed his many guests\\nAlcinous killed twelve sheep, and eight boars\\nwith silver tusks, and two slow-lumbering cows. \\nSkinning the animals, they cooked a feast.\\nThe house boy brought the poet, whom the Muse\\nadored. She gave him two gifts, good and bad:\\nshe took his sight away, but gave sweet song.\\nThe wine boy brought a silver-studded chair\\nand propped it by a pillar, in the middle\\nof all the guests, and by a peg he hung\\nthe poet’s lyre above his head and helped him\\nto reach it, and he set a table by him,\\nand a bread basket and a cup of wine \\nto drink whenever he desired. They all\\ntook food. When they were satisfied, the Muse\\nprompted the bard to sing of famous actions,\\nan episode whose fame has touched the sky:\\nAchilles’ and Odysseus’ quarrel—\\nhow at a splendid sacrificial feast,\\nthey argued bitterly, and Agamemnon\\nwas glad because the best of the Achaeans\\nwere quarreling, since when he had consulted\\nthe oracle at Pytho, crossing over \\nthe entry stone, Apollo had foretold\\nthat this would be the start of suﬀering\\nfor Greeks and Trojans, through the plans of Zeus.\\nSo sang the famous bard. Odysseus\\nwith his strong hands picked up his heavy cloak\\nof purple, and he covered up his face.\\nHe was ashamed to let them see him cry.\\nEach time the singer paused, Odysseus\\nwiped tears, drew down the cloak and poured a splash\\nof wine out of his goblet, for the gods. \\nBut each time, the Phaeacian nobles urged\\nthe bard to sing again—they loved his songs.\\nSo he would start again; Odysseus\\nwould moan and hide his head beneath his cloak.\\nOnly Alcinous could see his tears,\\nsince he was sitting next to him, and heard\\nhis sobbing. So he quickly spoke.\\n“My lords!\\nWe have already satisfied our wish\\nfor feasting, and the lyre, the feast’s companion.\\nNow let us go outside and set up contests \\nin every sport, so when our guest goes home\\nhe can tell all his friends we are the best\\nat boxing, wrestling, high-jumping, and sprinting.”\\nWith that he led the way; the others followed.\\nThe boy took down the lyre from its peg\\nand took Demodocus’ hand to lead him\\nout with the crowd who went to watch the games.\\nMany young athletes stood there: Acroneus,\\nOcyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus,\\nThoon, Anchialus, Eretmeus, \\nAnabesineus and Ponteus,\\nPrymneus, Proreus, Amphialus,\\nthe son of Polynaus, son of Tecton,\\nand Naubolus’ son, Euryalus,\\nlike Ares, cause of ruin. In his looks\\nand strength, he was the best in all Phaeacia,\\nafter Laodamas. Three sons of great\\nAlcinous stood up: Laodamas,\\ngodlike Clytoneus, and Halius.\\nFirst came the footrace. They lined up, then dashed \\nall in an instant, right around the track\\nso fast they raised the dust up from the field.\\nClytoneus was the best by far at sprinting:\\nhe raced past all the others by the length\\nof a field plowed by mules, and reached the crowd.\\nNext came the brutal sport of wrestling,\\nin which Euryalus was best. In jumping,\\nAmphialus excelled. And at the discus,\\nby far the best of all was Elatreus.\\nThe prince Laodamas excelled at boxing. \\nThey all enjoyed the games. When they were over,\\nLaodamas, Alcinous’ son,\\nsaid,\\n“Now my friends, we ought to ask the stranger\\nif he plays any sports. His build is strong;\\nhis legs and arms and neck are very sturdy,\\nand he is in his prime, though he has been\\nbroken by suﬀering. No pain can shake\\na man as badly as the sea, however\\nstrong he once was.”\\nEuryalus replied,\\n“You are quite right, Laodamas. Why not \\ncall out to challenge him yourself?”\\nThe noble\\nson of Alcinous agreed with him.\\nHe stood up in the middle of them all\\nand called Odysseus.\\n“Come here!” he said.\\n“Now you, sir! You should try our games as well,\\nif you know any sports; it seems you would.\\nNothing can be more glorious for a man,\\nin a whole lifetime, than what he achieves\\nwith hands and feet. So try, set care aside.\\nSoon you will travel, since your ship is launched. \\nThe crew is standing by.”\\nOdysseus\\nthought carefully—he had a plan. He answered,\\n“Laodamas, why mock me with this challenge?\\nMy heart is set on sorrow, not on games,\\nsince I have suﬀered and endured so much\\nthat now I only want to get back home.\\nI sit here praying to your king and people\\nto grant my wish.”\\nEuryalus responded\\nwith outright taunting.\\n“Stranger, I suppose\\nyou must be ignorant of all athletics. \\nI know your type. The captain of a crew\\nof merchant sailors, you roam round at sea\\nand only care about your freight and cargo,\\nkeeping close watch on your ill-gotten gains.\\nYou are no athlete.”\\nWith a scowl, he answered,\\n“What crazy arrogance from you, you stranger!\\nThe gods do not bless everyone the same,\\nwith equal gifts of body, mind, or speech.\\nOne man is weak, but gods may crown his words\\nwith loveliness. Men gladly look to him; \\nhis speech is steady, with calm dignity.\\nHe stands out from his audience, and when\\nhe walks through town, the people look at him\\nas if he were a god. Another man\\nhas godlike looks but no grace in his words.\\nLike you—you look impressive, and a god\\ncould not improve your body. But your mind\\nis crippled. You have stirred my heart to anger\\nwith these outrageous comments. I am not\\nlacking experience of sports and games. \\nWhen I was young, I trusted my strong arms\\nand was among the first. Now pain has crushed me.\\nI have endured the agonies of war,\\nand struggled through the dangers of the sea.\\nBut you have challenged me and stung my heart.\\nDespite my suﬀering, I will compete.”\\nWith that he leapt up, cloak and all, and seized\\na massive discus, heavier than that\\nused by the others. He spun around, drew back\\nhis arm and from his brawny hand he hurled. \\nThe stone went humming. The Phaeacians, known\\nfor rowing, ducked down cowering beneath\\nits arc; it flew beyond the other pegs.\\nAthena marked the spot. In human guise\\nshe spoke.\\n“A blind man, stranger, could discern\\nthis mark by groping. It is far ahead\\nof all the others. You can celebrate!\\nYou won this round, and none of them will ever\\nthrow further—or as far!”\\nOdysseus\\nwas thrilled to realize he had a friend \\nto take his side, and with a lighter heart,\\nhe told the young Phaeacians,\\n“Try to match this!\\nIf you can do it, I will throw another,\\nas far or farther. You have made me angry,\\nso I will take you on in any sport.\\nCome on! In boxing, wrestling, or sprinting,\\nI will compete with anyone, except\\nLaodamas: he is my host. Who would\\nfight with a friend? A man who challenges\\nthose who have welcomed him in a strange land \\nis worthless and a fool; he spites himself.\\nBut I will challenge any of you others.\\nTest my ability, let me know yours.\\nI am not weak at any sport men practice.\\nI know the way to hold a polished bow.\\nI always was the first to hit my man\\nout of a horde of enemies, though many\\ncomrades stood by me, arrows taking aim.\\nAt Troy, when the Achaeans shot their bows,\\nthe only one superior to me \\nwas Philoctetes. Other men who eat\\ntheir bread on earth are all worse shots than me.\\nBut I will not compete with super-archers,\\nwith Heracles or Eurytus, who risked\\ncompeting with the gods at archery.\\nApollo was enraged at him and killed him\\nas soon as he proposed it. He died young\\nand did not reach old age in his own home.\\nAnd I can throw a spear beyond the shots\\nthat others reach with arrows. I am only \\nconcerned that one of you may win the footrace:\\nI lost my stamina and my legs weakened\\nduring my time at sea, upon the raft;\\nI could not do my exercise routine.”\\nThe crowd was silent, but Alcinous\\nsaid, “Sir, you have expressed, with fine good manners,\\nyour wish to show your talents, and your anger\\nat that man who stood up in this arena\\nand mocked you, as no one who understands\\nhow to speak properly would ever do. \\nNow listen carefully, so you may tell\\nyour own fine friends at home when you are feasting\\nbeside your wife and children, and remember\\nour skill in all the deeds we have accomplished\\nfrom our forefathers’ time till now. We are\\nnot brilliant at wrestling or boxing,\\nbut we are quick at sprinting, and with ships\\nwe are the best. We love the feast, the lyre,\\ndancing and varied clothes, hot baths and bed.\\nBut now let the best dancers of Phaeacia \\nperform, so that our guest may tell his friends\\nwhen he gets home, how excellent we are\\nat seafaring, at running, and at dancing\\nand song. Let someone bring the well-tuned lyre\\nfrom inside for Demodocus—go quickly!”\\nSo spoke the king. The house boy brought the lyre.\\nThe people chose nine referees to check\\nthe games were fair. They leveled out a floor\\nfor dancing, with a fine wide ring around.\\nThe house boy gave Demodocus the lyre. \\nHe walked into the middle, flanked by boys,\\nyoung and well trained, who tapped their feet performing\\nthe holy dance, their quick legs bright with speed.\\nOdysseus was wonder-struck to see it.\\nThe poet strummed and sang a charming song\\nabout the love of fair-crowned Aphrodite\\nfor Ares, who gave lavish gifts to her\\nand shamed the bed of Lord Hephaestus, where\\nthey secretly had sex. The Sun God saw them,\\nand told Hephaestus—bitter news for him. \\nHe marched into his forge to get revenge,\\nand set the mighty anvil on its block,\\nand hammered chains so strong that they could never\\nbe broken or undone. He was so angry\\nat Ares. When his trap was made, he went\\ninside the room of his beloved bed,\\nand twined the mass of cables all around\\nthe bedposts, and then hung them from the ceiling,\\nlike slender spiderwebs, so finely made\\nthat nobody could see them, even gods: \\nthe craftsmanship was so ingenious.\\nWhen he had set that trap across the bed,\\nhe traveled to the cultured town of Lemnos,\\nwhich was his favorite place in all the world.\\nAres the golden rider had kept watch.\\nHe saw Hephaestus, famous wonder-worker,\\nleaving his house, and went inside himself;\\nhe wanted to make love with Aphrodite.\\nShe had returned from visiting her father,\\nthe mighty son of Cronus; there she sat. \\nThen Ares took her hand and said to her,\\n“My darling, let us go to bed. Hephaestus\\nis out of town; he must have gone to Lemnos\\nto see the Sintians whose speech is strange.”\\nShe was excited to lie down with him;\\nthey went to bed together. But the chains\\ningenious Hephaestus had created\\nwrapped tight around them, so they could not move\\nor get up. Then they knew that they were trapped.\\nThe limping god drew near—before he reached \\nthe land of Lemnos, he had turned back home.\\nTroubled at heart, he came towards his house.\\nStanding there in the doorway, he was seized\\nby savage rage. He gave a mighty shout,\\ncalling to all the gods,\\n“O Father Zeus,\\nand all you blessed gods who live forever,\\nlook! You may laugh, but it is hard to bear.\\nSee how my Aphrodite, child of Zeus,\\nis disrespecting me for being lame.\\nShe loves destructive Ares, who is strong \\nand handsome. I am weak. I blame my parents.\\nIf only I had not been born! But come,\\nsee where those two are sleeping in my bed,\\nas lovers. I am horrified to see it.\\nBut I predict they will not want to lie\\nlonger like that, however great their love.\\nSoon they will want to wake up, but my trap\\nand chains will hold them fast, until her father\\npays back the price I gave him for his daughter.\\nHer eyes stare at me like a dog. She is \\nso beautiful, but lacking self-control.”\\nThe gods assembled at his house: Poseidon,\\nEarth-Shaker, helpful Hermes, and Apollo.\\nThe goddesses stayed home, from modesty.\\nThe blessed gods who give good things were standing\\ninside the doorway, and they burst out laughing,\\nat what a clever trap Hephaestus set.\\nAnd as they looked, they said to one another,\\n“Crime does not pay! The slow can beat the quick,\\nas now Hephaestus, who is lame and slow, \\nhas used his skill to catch the fastest sprinter\\nof all those on Olympus. Ares owes\\nthe price for his adultery.” They gossiped.\\nApollo, son of Zeus, then said to Hermes,\\n“Hermes my brother, would you like to sleep\\nwith golden Aphrodite, in her bed,\\neven weighed down by mighty chains?”\\nAnd Hermes\\nthe sharp-eyed messenger replied, “Ah, brother,\\nApollo lord of archery: if only!\\nI would be bound three times as tight or more \\nand let you gods and all your wives look on,\\nif only I could sleep with Aphrodite.”\\nThen laughter rose among the deathless gods.\\nOnly Poseidon did not laugh. He begged\\nand pleaded with Hephaestus to release\\nAres. He told the wonder-working god,\\n“Now let him go! I promise he will pay\\nthe penalty in full among the gods,\\njust as you ask.”\\nThe famous limping god\\nreplied, “Poseidon, do not ask me this. \\nIt is disgusting, bailing scoundrels out.\\nHow could I bind you, while the gods look on,\\nif Ares should escape his bonds and debts?”\\nPoseidon, Lord of Earthquakes, answered him,\\n“Hephaestus, if he tries to dodge this debt,\\nI promise I will pay.”\\nThe limping god\\nsaid, “Then, in courtesy to you, I must\\ndo as you ask.” So using all his strength,\\nHephaestus loosed the chains. The pair of lovers\\nwere free from their constraints, and both jumped up. \\nAres went oﬀ to Thrace, while Aphrodite\\nsmiled as she went to Cyprus, to the island\\nof Paphos, where she had a fragrant altar\\nand sanctuary. The Graces washed her there,\\nand rubbed her with the magic oil that glows\\nupon immortals, and they dressed her up\\nin gorgeous clothes. She looked astonishing.\\nThat was the poet’s song. Odysseus\\nwas happy listening; so were they all.\\nAnd then Alcinous told Halius \\nto dance with Laodamas; no one danced\\nas well as them. They took a purple ball\\nwhich Polybus the artisan had made them.\\nOne boy would leap and toss it to the clouds;\\nthe other would jump up, feet oﬀ the ground,\\nand catch it easily before he landed.\\nAfter they practiced throwing it straight upwards,\\nthey danced across the fertile earth, crisscrossing,\\nconstantly trading places. Other boys\\nwho stood around the field were beating time \\nwith noisy stomping. Then Odysseus\\nsaid,\\n“King of many citizens, great lord,\\nyou boasted that your dancers are the best,\\nand it is true. I feel amazed to see\\nthis marvelous show.”\\nThat pleased the reverend king.\\nHe spoke at once to his seafaring people.\\n“Hear me, Phaeacian leaders, lords and nobles.\\nThe stranger seems extremely wise to me.\\nSo let us give him gifts, as hosts should do\\nto guests in friendship. Twelve lords rule our people, \\nwith me as thirteenth lord. Let us each bring\\na pound of precious gold and laundered clothes,\\na tunic and a cloak. Then pile them up,\\nand let our guest take all these gifts, and go\\nto dinner with them, happy in his heart.\\nEuryalus should tell him he is sorry,\\nand give a special gift, since what he said\\nwas inappropriate.”\\nThey all agreed,\\nand each sent back a deputy to fetch\\nthe presents. And Euryalus spoke out. \\n“My lord Alcinous, great king of kings,\\nI will apologize, as you command.\\nAnd I will give him this bronze sword which has\\na silver handle, and a scabbard carved\\nof ivory—a precious gift for him.”\\nWith that he put the silver-studded sword\\ninto Odysseus’ hands; his words\\nflew out.\\n“I welcome you, sir. Be our guest.\\nIf something rude of any kind was said,\\nlet the winds take it. May the gods allow you \\nto reach your home and see your wife again,\\nsince you have suﬀered so long, far away\\nfrom those who love you.”\\nAnd Odysseus\\nsaid, “Friend, I wish you well. May gods protect you,\\nand may you never miss the sword you gave me.”\\nWith that, he strapped the silver-studded sword\\nacross his back, and as the sun went down\\nthe precious gifts were brought to him. The slaves\\ntook them inside Alcinous’ house.\\nThe princes piled the lovely things beside \\nthe queen, their mother. King Alcinous\\nled everyone inside and had them sit\\non upright chairs. He told Arete,\\n“Wife,\\nbring out our finest chest, and put inside it\\na tunic and a freshly laundered cloak.\\nSet a bronze cauldron on the fire to boil,\\nso he can take a bath. Then let him see\\nthe precious gifts our noblemen have brought,\\nand then enjoy the banquet and the song.\\nI also have a gift: a splendid cup \\nof gold. I hope he always thinks of me\\nwhenever he pours oﬀerings to Zeus\\nand other gods.”\\nArete told her slaves\\nto quickly set a mighty pot to warm,\\nfor washing. So upon the blazing flames\\nthey set the cauldron and poured water in,\\nand heaped up wood. The fire licked around\\nthe belly of the tub and warmed the water.\\nArete brought from her own room a chest\\nto give the guest, and packed the gifts inside— \\nthe clothes and gold that they had given him;\\nand she herself put in a cloak and tunic.\\nShe told him,\\n“Watch the lid, and tie it closed,\\nso nobody can rob you as you travel,\\nwhen you are lulled to sleep on your black ship.”\\nOdysseus, experienced in loss,\\ntook careful note. He shut the lid and tied\\na cunning knot that he had learned from Circe.\\nThen right away the slave girl led him oﬀ\\ntowards the bath to wash. He was delighted \\nto see hot water. He had not been bathed\\nsince he had left the home of curly-haired\\nCalypso, who had taken care of him\\nas if he were a god. The slave girls washed him,\\nrubbed oil on him and dressed him in a tunic\\nand fine wool mantle. Freshly bathed, he joined\\nthe men at wine. And there stood Nausicaa,\\ndivinely beautiful, beside a pillar\\nthat held the palace roof. She was amazed\\nto see Odysseus. Her words flew fast. \\n“Good-bye then, stranger, but remember me\\nwhen you reach home, because you owe your life\\nto me. I helped you first.”\\nOdysseus\\nreplied politely, “Nausicaa, may Zeus,\\nhusband of Hera, mighty Lord of Thunder,\\nallow me to go back and see my home.\\nThere I shall pray to you as to a god,\\nforever, princess, since you saved my life.”\\nWith that he went to sit beside the king.\\nNow they were serving out the food and pouring \\nwine, and the steward led out to the center\\nDemodocus, the well-respected poet.\\nHe sat him in the middle of the banquet,\\nagainst a pillar. Then Odysseus\\nthought fast, and sliced a helping from the pig,\\nall richly laced with fat. The plate of meat\\nhad plenty left. He told the boy,\\n“Go take\\nthis meat and give it to Demodocus.\\nDespite my grief, I would be glad to meet him.\\nPoets are honored by all those who live \\non earth. The Muse has taught them how to sing;\\nshe loves the race of poets.”\\nSo the house boy\\nhanded it to Demodocus. He took it\\ngladly; and everybody took their food.\\nWhen they had had enough to eat and drink,\\nthe clever mastermind of many schemes\\nsaid,\\n“You are wonderful, Demodocus!\\nI praise you more than anyone; Apollo,\\nor else the Muse, the child of Zeus, has taught you.\\nYou tell so accurately what the Greeks \\nachieved, and what they suﬀered, there at Troy,\\nas if you had been there, or heard about it\\nfrom somebody who was. So sing the story\\nabout the Wooden Horse, which Epeius\\nbuilt with Athena’s help. Odysseus\\ndragged it inside and to the citadel,\\nfilled up with men to sack the town. If you\\ncan tell that as it happened, I will say\\nthat you truly are blessed with inspiration.”\\nA god inspired the bard to sing. He started \\nwith how the Greeks set fire to their camp\\nand then embarked and sailed away. Meanwhile,\\nOdysseus brought in a gang of men\\ninto the heart of Troy, inside the horse.\\nThe Trojans pulled the thing up to the summit,\\nand sat around discussing what to do.\\nSome said, “We ought to strike the wood with swords!”\\nOthers said, “Drag it higher up and hurl it\\ndown from the rocks!” But some said they should leave it\\nto pacify the gods. So it would be. \\nThe town was doomed to ruin when it took\\nthat horse, chock-full of fighters bringing death\\nto Trojans. And he sang how the Achaeans\\npoured from the horse, in ambush from the hollow,\\nand sacked the city; how they scattered out,\\ndestroying every neighborhood. Like Ares,\\nOdysseus, with Menelaus, rushed\\nto find Deiphobus’ house, and there\\nhe won at last, through dreadful violence,\\nthanks to Athena. So the poet sang. \\nOdysseus was melting into tears;\\nhis cheeks were wet with weeping, as a woman\\nweeps, as she falls to wrap her arms around\\nher husband, fallen fighting for his home\\nand children. She is watching as he gasps\\nand dies. She shrieks, a clear high wail, collapsing\\nupon his corpse. The men are right behind.\\nThey hit her shoulders with their spears and lead her\\nto slavery, hard labor, and a life\\nof pain. Her face is marked with her despair. \\nIn that same desperate way, Odysseus\\nwas crying. No one noticed that his eyes\\nwere wet with tears, except Alcinous,\\nwho sat right next to him and heard his sobs.\\nQuickly he spoke to his seafaring people.\\n“Listen, my lords and nobles of Phaeacia!\\nDemodocus should stop and set aside\\nthe lyre, since what he sings does not give pleasure\\nto everyone. Throughout this heavenly song,\\nsince dinnertime, our guest has been in pain, \\ngrieving. A heavy burden weighs his heart.\\nLet the song end, so we can all be happy,\\nboth guest and hosts. That would be best by far.\\nThis send-oﬀ party and these precious gifts,\\nwhich we give out of friendship, are for him,\\nour guest of honor. Any man of sense\\nwill treat a guest in need like his own brother.\\nStranger, now answer all my questions clearly,\\nnot with evasion; frankness would be best.\\nWhat did your parents name you? With what name \\nare you known to your people? Surely no one\\nin all the world is nameless, poor or noble,\\nsince parents give a name to every child\\nat birth. And also tell me of your country,\\nyour people, and your city, so our ships,\\nsteered by their own good sense, may take you there.\\nPhaeacians have no need of men at helm\\nnor rudders, as in other ships. Our boats\\nintuit what is in the minds of men,\\nand know all human towns and fertile fields. \\nThey rush at full tilt right across the gulf\\nof salty sea, concealed in mist and clouds.\\nThey have no fear of damages or loss.\\nBut once I heard Nausithous, my father,\\nsay that Poseidon hates us for the help\\nwe give to take our guests across the sea,\\nand that one day a ship of ours would suﬀer\\nshipwreck on its return; a mighty mountain\\nwould block our town from sight. So Father said.\\nPerhaps the god will bring these things to pass \\nor not, as is his will. But come now, tell me\\nabout your wanderings: describe the places,\\nthe people, and the cities you have seen.\\nWhich ones were wild and cruel, unwelcoming,\\nand which were kind to visitors, respecting\\nthe gods? And please explain why you were crying,\\nsobbing your heart out when you heard him sing\\nwhat happened to the Greeks at Troy. The gods\\ndevised and measured out this devastation,\\nto make a song for those in times to come. \\nDid you lose somebody at Troy? A man\\nfrom your wife’s family, perhaps her father\\nor brother? Ties of marriage are the closest\\nafter the bonds of blood. Or else perhaps\\nyou lost the friend who knew you best of all?\\nA friend can be as close as any brother.”\\nBOOK \\nA Pirate in a Shepherd’s Cave\\nWily Odysseus, the lord of lies,\\nanswered,\\n“My lord Alcinous, great king,\\nit is a splendid thing to hear a poet\\nas talented as this. His voice is godlike.\\nI think that there can be no greater pleasure\\nthan when the whole community enjoys\\na banquet, as we sit inside the house,\\nand listen to the singer, and the tables\\nare heaped with bread and meat; the wine boy ladles\\ndrink from the bowl and pours it into cups. \\nTo me this seems ideal, a thing of beauty.\\nNow something prompted you to ask about\\nmy own sad story. I will tell you, though\\nthe memory increases my despair.\\nWhere shall I start? Where can I end? The gods\\nhave given me so much to cry about.\\nFirst I will tell my name, so we will be\\nacquainted and if I survive, you can\\nbe my guest in my distant home one day.\\nI am Odysseus, Laertes’ son, \\nknown for my many clever tricks and lies.\\nMy fame extends to heaven, but I live\\nin Ithaca, where shaking forest hides\\nMount Neriton. Close by are other islands:\\nDulichium, and wooded Zacynthus\\nand Same. All the others face the dawn;\\nmy Ithaca is set apart, most distant,\\nfacing the dark. It is a rugged land,\\nbut good at raising children. To my eyes\\nno country could be sweeter. As you know, \\ndivine Calpyso held me in her cave,\\nwanting to marry me; and likewise Circe,\\nthe trickster, trapped me, and she wanted me\\nto be her husband. But she never swayed\\nmy heart, since when a man is far from home,\\nliving abroad, there is no sweeter thing\\nthan his own native land and family.\\nNow let me tell you all the trouble Zeus\\nhas caused me on my journey home from Troy.\\nA blast of wind pushed me oﬀ course towards \\nthe Cicones in Ismarus. I sacked\\nthe town and killed the men. We took their wives\\nand shared their riches equally among us.\\nThen I said we must run away. Those fools\\nrefused to listen. They were drinking wine\\nexcessively, and killing sheep and cattle\\nalong the beach. The Cicones called out\\nto neighbors on the mainland, who were strong\\nand numerous, and skilled at horseback fighting,\\nand if need be, on foot. They came like leaves \\nand blossoms in the spring at dawn. Then Zeus\\ngave us bad luck. Poor us! The enemy\\nassembled round the ships and fought with swords\\nof bronze. And while the holy morning light\\nwas bright and strong, we held them oﬀ, though they\\noutnumbered us. But when the sun turned round\\nand dipped, the hour when oxen are released,\\nthe Cicones began to overpower\\nus Greeks. Six well-armed members of my crew\\ndied from each ship. The rest of us survived, \\nand we escaped the danger. We prepared\\nto sail away with heavy hearts, relieved\\nto be alive, but grieving for our friends.\\nBefore we launched the ships, we called aloud\\nthree times to each of our poor lost companions,\\nslaughtered at the hands of the Cicones.\\nThe Cloud Lord Zeus hurled North Wind at our ships,\\na terrible typhoon, and covered up\\nthe sea and earth with fog. Night fell from heaven\\nand seized us and our ships keeled over sideways; \\nthe sails were ripped three times by blasting wind.\\nScared for our lives, we hoisted down the sails\\nand rowed with all our might towards the shore.\\nWe stayed there for two days and nights, exhausted,\\neating our hearts with pain. When bright-haired Dawn\\nbrought the third morning, we set up our masts,\\nunfurled the shining sails, and climbed aboard.\\nThe wind blew straight, the pilots steered, and I\\nwould have come safely home, to my own land,\\nbut as I rounded Malea, a current \\nand blast of wind pushed me oﬀ course, away\\nfrom Cythera. For nine days I was swept\\nby stormy winds across the fish-filled sea.\\nOn the tenth day, I landed on the island\\nof those who live on food from lotus flowers.\\nWe gathered water, and my crew prepared\\na meal. We picnicked by the ships, then I\\nchose two men, and one slave to make the third,\\nto go and scout. We needed to find out\\nwhat kind of people lived there on that island. \\nThe scouts encountered humans, Lotus-Eaters,\\nwho did not hurt them. They just shared with them\\ntheir sweet delicious fruit. But as they ate it,\\nthey lost the will to come back and bring news\\nto me. They wanted only to stay there,\\nfeeding on lotus with the Lotus-Eaters.\\nThey had forgotten home. I dragged them back\\nin tears, forced them on board the hollow ships,\\npushed them below the decks, and tied them up.\\nI told the other men, the loyal ones, \\nto get back in the ships, so no one else\\nwould taste the lotus and forget about\\nour destination. They embarked and sat\\nalong the rowing benches, side by side,\\nand struck the grayish water with their oars.\\nWith heavy hearts we sailed along and reached\\nthe country of high-minded Cyclopes,\\nthe mavericks. They put their trust in gods,\\nand do not plant their food from seed, nor plow,\\nand yet the barley, grain, and clustering wine-grapes \\nall flourish there, increased by rain from Zeus.\\nThey hold no councils, have no common laws,\\nbut live in caves on lofty mountaintops,\\nand each makes laws for his own wife and children,\\nwithout concern for what the others think.\\nA distance from this island is another,\\nacross the water, slantways from the harbor,\\nlevel and thickly wooded. Countless goats\\nlive there but people never visit it.\\nNo hunters labor through its woods to scale \\nits hilly peaks. There are no flocks of sheep,\\nno fields of plowland—it is all untilled,\\nunsown and uninhabited by humans.\\nOnly the bleating goats live there and graze.\\nCyclopic people have no red-cheeked ships\\nand no shipwright among them who could build\\nboats, to enable them to row across\\nto other cities, as most people do,\\ncrossing the sea to visit one another.\\nWith boats they could have turned this island into \\na fertile colony, with proper harvests.\\nBy the gray shore there lie well-watered meadows,\\nwhere vines would never fail. There is flat land\\nfor plowing, and abundant crops would grow\\nin the autumn; there is richness underground.\\nThe harbor has good anchorage; there is\\nno need of anchor stones or ropes or cables.\\nThe ships that come to shore there can remain\\nbeached safely till the sailors wish to leave\\nand fair winds blow. Up by the harbor head \\nfreshwater gushes down beneath the caves.\\nThe poplars grow around it. There we sailed:\\nthe gods were guiding us all through the darkness.\\nThick fog wrapped round our ships and in the sky\\nthe moon was dark and clothed in clouds, so we\\nsaw nothing of the island. None of us\\ncould see the great waves rolling in towards\\nthe land, until we rowed right to the beach.\\nWe lowered all the sails and disembarked\\nonto the shore, and there we fell asleep. \\nWhen early Dawn shone forth with rosy fingers,\\nwe roamed around that island full of wonders.\\nThe daughters of the great King Zeus, the nymphs,\\ndrove out the mountain goats so that my crew\\ncould eat. On seeing them, we dashed to fetch\\nour javelins and bows from on board ship.\\nWe split into three groups, took aim and shot.\\nSome god gave us good hunting. All twelve crews\\nhad nine goats each, and ten for mine. We sat there\\nall day till sunset, eating meat and drinking \\nour strong red wine. The ships’ supply of that\\nhad not run out; when we had sacked the holy\\ncitadel of the Cicones, we all\\ntook gallons of it, poured in great big pitchers.\\nWe looked across the narrow strip of water\\nat the Cyclopic island, saw their smoke,\\nand heard the baaing of their sheep and goats.\\nThe sun went down and in the hours of darkness\\nwe lay and slept on shore beside the sea.\\nBut when the rosy hands of Dawn appeared, \\nI called my men together and addressed them.\\n‘My loyal friends! Stay here, the rest of you,\\nwhile with my boat and crew I go to check\\nwho those men are, find out if they are wild,\\nlawless aggressors, or the type to welcome\\nstrangers, and fear the gods.’\\nWith that, I climbed\\non board and told my crew to come with me\\nand then untie the cables of the ship.\\nQuickly they did so, sat along the benches,\\nand struck the whitening water with their oars. \\nThe journey was not long. Upon arrival,\\nright at the edge of land, beside the sea,\\nwe saw a high cave overhung with laurel,\\nthe home of several herds of sheep and goats.\\nAround that cave was built a lofty courtyard,\\nof deep-set stones, with tall pines rising up,\\nand leafy oaks. There lived a massive man\\nwho shepherded his flocks all by himself.\\nHe did not go to visit other people,\\nbut kept apart, and did not know the ways \\nof custom. In his build he was a wonder,\\na giant, not like men who live on bread,\\nbut like a wooded peak in airy mountains,\\nrising alone above the rest.\\nI told\\nmy loyal crew to guard the ship, while I\\nwould go with just twelve chosen men, my favorites.\\nI took a goatskin full of dark sweet wine\\nthat I was given by Apollo’s priest,\\nMaron the son of Euanthes, who lived\\ninside the shady grove on Ismarus. \\nIn reverence to the god, I came to help him,\\nand save his wife and son. He gave me gifts:\\na silver bowl and seven pounds of gold,\\nwell wrought, and siphoned oﬀ some sweet strong wine,\\nand filled twelve jars for me—a godlike drink.\\nThe slaves knew nothing of this wine; it was\\nknown just to him, his wife, and one house girl.\\nWhenever he was drinking it, he poured\\na single shot into a cup, and added\\ntwenty of water, and a marvelous smell \\nrose from the bowl, and all would long to taste it.\\nI filled a big skin up with it, and packed\\nprovisions in a bag—my heart suspected\\nthat I might meet a man of courage, wild,\\nand lacking knowledge of the normal customs.\\nWe soon were at the cave, but did not find\\nthe Cyclops; he was pasturing his flocks.\\nWe went inside and looked at everything.\\nWe saw his crates weighed down with cheese, and pens\\ncrammed full of lambs divided up by age: \\nthe newborns, middlings, and those just weaned.\\nThere were well-crafted bowls and pails for milking,\\nall full of whey. My crew begged, ‘Let us grab\\nsome cheese and quickly drive the kids and lambs\\nout of their pens and down to our swift ships,\\nand sail away across the salty water!’\\nThat would have been the better choice. But I\\nrefused. I hoped to see him, and find out\\nif he would give us gifts. In fact he brought\\nno joy to my companions. Then we lit \\na fire, and made a sacrifice, and ate\\nsome cheese, and sat to wait inside the cave\\nuntil he brought his flocks back home. He came\\nat dinnertime, and brought a load of wood\\nto make a fire. He hurled it noisily\\ninto the cave. We were afraid, and cowered\\ntowards the back. He drove his ewes and nannies\\ninside to milk them, but he left the rams\\nand he-goats in the spacious yard outside.\\nHe lifted up the heavy stone and set it \\nto block the entrance of the cave. It was\\na rock so huge and massive, twenty-two\\nstrong carts could not have dragged it from the\\nthreshold.\\nHe sat, and all in order milked his ewes\\nand she-goats, then he set the lambs to suck\\nbeside each bleating mother. Then he curdled\\nhalf of the fresh white milk, set that aside\\nin wicker baskets, and the rest he stored\\nin pails so he could drink it with his dinner.\\nWhen he had carefully performed his chores, \\nhe lit a fire, then looked around and saw us.\\n‘Strangers! Who are you? Where did you come from\\nacross the watery depths? Are you on business,\\nor roaming round without a goal, like pirates,\\nwho risk their lives at sea to bring disaster\\nto other people?’\\nSo he spoke. His voice,\\nso deep and booming, and his giant size,\\nmade our hearts sink in terror. Even so,\\nI answered,\\n‘We are Greeks, come here from Troy.\\nThe winds have swept us oﬀ in all directions \\nacross the vast expanse of sea, oﬀ course\\nfrom our planned route back home. Zeus willed it so.\\nWe are proud to be the men of Agamemnon,\\nthe son of Atreus, whose fame is greatest\\nunder the sky, for sacking that vast city\\nand killing many people. Now we beg you,\\nhere at your knees, to grant a gift, as is\\nthe norm for hosts and guests. Please sir, my lord:\\nrespect the gods. We are your suppliants,\\nand Zeus is on our side, since he takes care \\nof visitors, guest-friends, and those in need.’\\nUnmoved he said, ‘Well, foreigner, you are\\na fool, or from some very distant country.\\nYou order me to fear the gods! My people\\nthink nothing of that Zeus with his big scepter,\\nnor any god; our strength is more than theirs.\\nIf I spare you or spare your friends, it will not\\nbe out of fear of Zeus. I do the bidding\\nof my own heart. But are you going far\\nin that fine ship of yours, or somewhere near?’ \\nHe spoke to test me, but I saw right through him.\\nI know how these things work. I answered him\\ndeceitfully.\\n‘Poseidon, the Earth-Shaker,\\nshipwrecked me at the far end of your island.\\nHe pushed us in; wind dashed us on the rocks.\\nWe barely managed to survive.’\\nBut he\\nmade no reply and showed no mercy. Leaping\\nup high, he reached his hands towards my men,\\nseized two, and knocked them hard against the ground\\nlike puppies, and the floor was wet with brains. \\nHe ripped them limb by limb to make his meal,\\nthen ate them like a lion on the mountains,\\ndevouring flesh, entrails, and marrow bones,\\nand leaving nothing. Watching this disaster,\\nwe wept and lifted up our hands in prayer\\nto Zeus. We felt so helpless. When the Cyclops\\nhad filled his massive belly with his meal\\nof human meat and unmixed milk, he lay\\nstretched out among his flocks. Then thinking like\\na military man, I thought I should \\nget out my sword, go up to him and thrust\\nright through his torso, feeling for his liver.\\nThat would have doomed us all. On second thoughts,\\nI realized we were too weak to move\\nthe mighty stone he set in the high doorway.\\nSo we stayed there in misery till dawn.\\nEarly the Dawn appeared, pink fingers blooming,\\nand then he lit his fire and milked his ewes\\nin turn, and set a lamb by every one.\\nWhen he had diligently done his chores, \\nhe grabbed two men and made a meal of them.\\nAfter he ate, he drove his fat flock out.\\nHe rolled the boulder out and back with ease,\\nas one would set the lid upon a quiver.\\nThen whistling merrily, the Cyclops drove\\nhis fat flocks to the mountain. I was left,\\nscheming to take revenge on him and hurt him,\\nand gain the glory, if Athena let me.\\nI made my plan. Beside the pen there stood\\na great big club, green olive wood, which he \\nhad cut to dry, to be his walking stick.\\nIt was so massive that it looked to us\\nlike a ship’s mast, a twenty-oared black freighter\\nthat sails across the vast sea full of cargo.\\nI went and cut from it about a fathom,\\nand gave it to the men, and ordered them\\nto scrape it down. They made it smooth and I\\nstood by and sharpened up the tip, and made it\\nhard in the blazing flame. The cave was full\\nof dung; I hid the club beneath a pile. \\nThen I gave orders that the men cast lots\\nfor who would lift the stake with me and press it\\ninto his eye, when sweet sleep overtook him.\\nThe lots fell on the men I would have chosen:\\nfour men, and I was fifth among their number.\\nAt evening he drove back his woolly flocks\\ninto the spacious cave, both male and female,\\nand left none in the yard outside—perhaps\\nsuspecting something, or perhaps a god\\ntold him to do it. He picked up and placed \\nthe stone to form a door, and sat to milk\\nthe sheep and bleating goats in turn, then put\\nthe little ones to suck. His chores were done;\\nhe grabbed two men for dinner. I approached\\nand oﬀered him a cup of ivy wood,\\nfilled full of wine. I said,\\n‘Here, Cyclops! You\\nhave eaten human meat; now drink some wine,\\nsample the merchandise our ship contains.\\nI brought it as a holy oﬀering,\\nso you might pity me and send me home. \\nBut you are in a cruel rage, beyond\\nwhat anyone could bear. Do you expect\\nmore guests, when you have treated us so rudely?’\\nHe took and drank the sweet delicious wine;\\nhe loved it, and demanded more.\\n‘Another!\\nAnd now tell me your name, so I can give you\\na present as my guest, one you will like.\\nMy people do have wine; grape clusters grow\\nfrom our rich earth, fed well by rain from Zeus.\\nBut this is nectar, god food!’\\nSo I gave him \\nanother cup of wine, and then two more.\\nHe drank them all, unwisely. With the wine\\ngone to his head, I told him, all politeness,\\n‘Cyclops, you asked my name. I will reveal it;\\nthen you must give the gift you promised me,\\nof hospitality. My name is Noman.\\nMy family and friends all call me Noman.’\\nHe answered with no pity in his heart,\\n‘I will eat Noman last; first I will eat\\nthe other men. That is my gift to you.’ \\nThen he collapsed, fell on his back, and lay there,\\nhis massive neck askew. All-conquering sleep\\ntook him. In drunken heaviness, he spewed\\nwine from his throat, and chunks of human flesh.\\nAnd then I drove the spear into the embers\\nto heat it up, and told my men, ‘Be brave!’\\nI wanted none of them to shrink in fear.\\nThe fire soon seized the olive spear,\\ngreen though it was, and terribly it glowed.\\nI quickly snatched it from the fire. My crew \\nstood firm: some god was breathing courage in us.\\nThey took the olive spear, its tip all sharp,\\nand shoved it in his eye. I leaned on top\\nand twisted it, as when a man drills wood\\nfor shipbuilding. Below, the workers spin\\nthe drill with straps, stretched out from either end.\\nSo round and round it goes, and so we whirled\\nthe fire-sharp weapon in his eye. His blood\\npoured out around the stake, and blazing fire\\nsizzled his lids and brows, and fried the roots. \\nAs when a blacksmith dips an axe or adze\\nto temper it in ice-cold water; loudly\\nit shrieks. From this, the iron takes on its power.\\nSo did his eyeball crackle on the spear.\\nHorribly then he howled, the rocks resounded,\\nand we shrank back in fear. He tugged the spear\\nout of his eye, all soaked with gushing blood.\\nDesperately with both hands he hurled it from him,\\nand shouted to the Cyclopes who lived\\nin caves high up on windy cliﬀs around. \\nThey heard and came from every side, and stood\\nnear to the cave, and called out, ‘Polyphemus!\\nWhat is the matter? Are you badly hurt?\\nWhy are you screaming through the holy night\\nand keeping us awake? Is someone stealing\\nyour herds, or trying to kill you, by some trick\\nor force?’\\nStrong Polyphemus from inside\\nreplied, ‘My friends! Noman is killing me\\nby tricks, not force.’\\nTheir words flew back to him:\\n‘If no one hurts you, you are all alone: \\nGreat Zeus has made you sick; no help for that.\\nPray to your father, mighty Lord Poseidon.’\\nThen oﬀ they went, and I laughed to myself,\\nat how my name, the ‘no man’ maneuver, tricked him.\\nThe Cyclops groaned and labored in his pain,\\nfelt with blind hands and took the door-stone out,\\nand sat there at the entrance, arms outstretched,\\nto catch whoever went out with the sheep.\\nMaybe he thought I was a total fool.\\nBut I was strategizing, hatching plans, \\nso that my men and I could all survive.\\nI wove all kinds of wiles and cunning schemes;\\ndanger was near and it was life or death.\\nThe best idea I formed was this: there were\\nthose well-fed sturdy rams with good thick fleece,\\nwool as dark as violets—all fine big creatures.\\nSo silently I tied them with the rope\\nused by the giant Cyclops as a bed.\\nI bound the rams in sets of three and set\\na man beneath each middle sheep, with one \\non either side, and so my men were saved.\\nOne ram was best of all the flock; I grabbed\\nhis back and curled myself up underneath\\nhis furry belly, clinging to his fleece;\\nby force of will I kept on hanging there.\\nAnd then we waited miserably for day.\\nWhen early Dawn revealed her rose-red hands,\\nthe rams jumped up, all eager for the grass.\\nThe ewes were bleating in their pens, unmilked,\\ntheir udders full to bursting. Though their master \\nwas weak and worn with pain, he felt the back\\nof each ram as he lined them up—but missed\\nthe men tied up beneath their woolly bellies.\\nLast of them all, the big ram went outside,\\nheavy with wool and me—the clever trickster.\\nStrong Polyphemus stroked his back and asked him,\\n‘Sweet ram, why are you last today to leave\\nthe cave? You are not normally so slow.\\nYou are the first to eat the tender flowers,\\nleaping across the meadow, first to drink, \\nand first to want to go back to the sheepfold\\nat evening time. But now you are the last.\\nYou grieve for Master’s eye; that wicked man,\\nhelped by his nasty henchmen, got me drunk\\nand blinded me. Noman will not escape!\\nIf only you could talk like me, and tell me\\nwhere he is skulking in his fear of me.\\nThen I would dash his brains out on the rocks,\\nand make them spatter all across the cave,\\nto ease the pain that no-good Noman brought.’ \\nWith that, he nudged the ram away outside.\\nWe rode a short way from the cave, then I\\nfirst freed myself and then untied my men.\\nWe stole his nice fat animals, and ran,\\nconstantly glancing all around and back\\nuntil we reached the ship. The other men\\nwere glad to see us, their surviving friends,\\nbut wept for those who died. I ordered them\\nto stop their crying, scowling hard at each.\\nI made them shove the fleecy flock on board, \\nand row the boat out into salty water.\\nSo they embarked, sat on their rowing benches,\\nand struck their oar blades in the whitening sea.\\nWhen I had gone as far as shouts can carry,\\nI jeered back,\\n‘Hey, you, Cyclops! Idiot!\\nThe crew trapped in your cave did not belong\\nto some poor weakling. Well, you had it coming!\\nYou had no shame at eating your own guests!\\nSo Zeus and other gods have paid you back.’\\nMy taunting made him angrier. He ripped \\na rock out of the hill and hurled it at us.\\nIt landed right in front of our dark prow,\\nand almost crushed the tip of the steering oar.\\nThe stone sank in the water; waves surged up.\\nThe backflow all at once propelled the ship\\nlandwards; the swollen water pushed us with it.\\nI grabbed a big long pole, and shoved us oﬀ.\\nI told my men, ‘Row fast, to save your lives!’\\nand gestured with my head to make them hurry.\\nThey bent down to their oars and started rowing. \\nWe got out twice as far across the sea,\\nand then I called to him again. My crew\\nbegged me to stop, and pleaded with me.\\n‘Please!\\nCalm down! Why are you being so insistent\\nand taunting this wild man? He hurled that stone\\nand drove our ship right back to land. We thought\\nthat we were going to die. If he had heard us,\\nhe would have hurled a jagged rock and crushed\\nour heads and wooden ship. He throws so hard!\\nBut my tough heart was not convinced; I was \\nstill furious, and shouted back again,\\n‘Cyclops! If any mortal asks you how\\nyour eye was mutilated and made blind,\\nsay that Odysseus, the city-sacker,\\nLaertes’ son, who lives in Ithaca,\\ndestroyed your sight.’\\nHe groaned, ‘The prophecy!\\nIt has come true at last! There was a tall\\nand handsome man named Telemus, the son\\nof Eurymus, who lived among my people;\\nhe spent his life here, soothsaying for us. \\nHe told me that Odysseus’ hands\\nwould make me lose my sight. I always thought\\na tall and handsome man would visit me,\\nendowed with strength and courage. But this weakling,\\nthis little nobody, has blinded me;\\nby wine he got the best of me. Come on,\\nOdysseus, and let me give you gifts,\\nand ask Poseidon’s help to get you home.\\nI am his son; the god is proud to be\\nmy father. He will heal me, if he wants, \\nthough no one else, not god nor man, can do it.’\\nAfter he said these words, I answered him,\\n‘If only I could steal your life from you,\\nand send you down to Hades’ house below,\\nas sure as nobody will ever heal you,\\neven the god of earthquakes.’\\nBut he prayed\\nholding his arms towards the starry sky,\\n‘Listen, Earth-Shaker, Blue-Haired Lord Poseidon:\\nacknowledge me your son, and be my father.\\nGrant that Odysseus, the city-sacker, \\nwill never go back home. Or if it is\\nfated that he will see his family,\\nthen let him get there late and with no honor,\\nin pain and lacking ships, and having caused\\nthe death of all his men, and let him find\\nmore trouble in his own house.’\\nBlue Poseidon\\ngranted his son’s prayer. Polyphemus raised\\na rock far bigger than the last, and swung,\\nthen hurled it with immeasurable force.\\nIt fell a little short, beside our rudder, \\nand splashed into the sea; the waves surged up,\\nand pushed the boat ahead, to the other shore.\\nWe reached the island where our ships were docked.\\nThe men were sitting waiting for us, weeping.\\nWe beached our ship and disembarked, then took\\nthe sheep that we had stolen from the Cyclops\\nout of the ship’s hold, and we shared them out\\nfairly, so all the men got equal portions.\\nBut in dividing up the flock, my crew\\ngave me alone the ram, the Cyclops’ favorite. \\nThere on the shore, I slaughtered him for Zeus,\\nthe son of Cronus, god of Dark Clouds, Lord\\nof all the world. I burned the thighs. The god\\nignored my oﬀering, and planned to ruin\\nall of my ships and all my loyal men.\\nSo all day long till sunset we were sitting,\\nfeasting on meat and drinking sweet strong wine.\\nBut when the sun went down and darkness fell,\\nwe went to sleep beside the breaking waves.\\nThen when rose-fingered Dawn came, bright and early, \\nI roused my men and told them to embark\\nand loose the cables. Quickly they obeyed,\\nsat at their rowing benches, all in order,\\nand struck the gray saltwater with their oars.\\nSo we sailed on, with sorrow in our hearts,\\nglad to survive, but grieving for our friends.”\\nBOOK \\nThe Winds and the Witch\\n“We reached the floating island of Aeolus,\\nwho is well loved by all the deathless gods.\\nAround it, on sheer cliﬀs, there runs a wall\\nof solid bronze, impregnable. Twelve children\\nlive with him in his palace: six strong boys,\\nand six girls. He arranged their marriages,\\none sister to each brother. They are always\\nfeasting there with their parents, at a banquet\\nthat never ends. By day, the savor fills\\nthe house; the court reverberates with sound. \\nAt night they sleep beside the wives they love\\non rope beds piled with blankets.\\nWe arrived\\nat that fine citadel. He welcomed me\\nand made me stay a month, and asked for news\\nof Troy, the Argive ships, and how the Greeks\\nwent home. I told him everything. At last\\nI told him he should send me on my way.\\nSo he agreed to help me, and he gave me\\na bag of oxhide leather and he tied\\nthe gusty winds inside it. Zeus, the son \\nof Cronus, made him steward of the winds,\\nand he can stop or rouse them as he wishes.\\nHe bound the bag with shining silver wire\\nto my curved ship, so no gust could escape,\\nhowever small, and he made Zephyr blow\\nso that the breath could carry home our ships\\nand us. But it was not to be. Our folly\\nruined us. For nine days and nights we sailed,\\nand on the tenth, our native land appeared.\\nWe were so near, we saw men tending fires. \\nExhausted, I let sweet sleep overcome me.\\nI had been doing all the steering, hoping\\nthat we would get home sooner if I did.\\nBut while I slept my men began to mutter,\\nsaying the great Aeolus gave me gifts—\\nsilver and gold that I was taking home.\\nWith glances to his neighbor, each complained,\\n‘It seems that everybody loves this man,\\nand honors him, in every place we sail to.\\nHe also has that loot from sacking Troy. \\nWe shared the journey with him, yet we come\\nback home with empty hands. And now Aeolus\\nhas made this friendly gift to him. So hurry,\\nwe should look in the bag, and see how much\\nis in there—how much silver, how much gold.’\\nThat bad idea took hold of them; they did it.\\nThey opened up the bag, and all the winds\\nrushed out at once. A sudden buﬀet seized us\\nand hurled us back to sea, the wrong direction,\\nfar from our home. They screamed and I woke up, \\nand wondered if I should jump oﬀ the ship\\nand drown, or bite my lip, be stoical,\\nand stay among the living. I endured it,\\ncovered my face, and lay on deck. A blast\\nof storm wind whooshed the ships back to the island\\nof great Aeolus. They began to weep.\\nWe disembarked and filled our jars with water,\\nand hungrily the men devoured their dinner.\\nWhen they were done, I took one slave with me\\nand one crew member, back to see Aeolus. \\nHe was at dinner with his wife and children.\\nWe entered and sat down beside the doorposts.\\nStartled, they asked,\\n‘Why are you here again?\\nYou had bad luck? What happened? Surely we\\nhelped you go on your way, and meant for you\\nto reach your homeland, where you wished to go.’\\nI answered sadly, ‘Blame my men, and blame\\nmy stubborn urge to sleep, which ruined us.\\nDear friends, you have the power to put things right.’\\nI hoped these words would soften them, but they \\nwere silent. Then the father yelled, ‘Get out!\\nYou nasty creature, leave my island! Now!\\nIt is not right for me to help convey\\na man so deeply hated by the gods.\\nYou godforsaken thing, how dare you come here?\\nGet out!’\\nHe roared and drove us from his palace.\\nDispirited, we sailed away. The men\\ngrew worn out with the agony of rowing;\\nour folly had deprived us of fair winds.\\nWe rowed six days and nights; the seventh day \\nwe came to Laestrygonia—the town\\nof Telepylus upon the cliﬀs of Lamos.\\nA herdsman there, returning to his home,\\ncan greet another herdsman going out.\\nA sleepless man could earn a double wage\\nby herding cows, then pasturing white sheep—\\nthe paths of day and night are close together.\\nWe reached the famous harbor, all surrounded\\nby sheer rock cliﬀs. On each side, strips of shore\\njut out and almost meet, a narrow mouth. \\nNo waves rear up in there, not even small ones.\\nWhite calm is everywhere. So all the others\\nharbored their ships inside, crammed close together.\\nI was the only one who chose to moor\\nmy ship outside the harbor, fastening\\nthe cables to a rock a way away.\\nI disembarked and climbed a crag to scout.\\nI saw no sign of cattle or of humans,\\nexcept some smoke that rose up from the earth.\\nI picked two men, and one slave as the third, \\nand sent them to find out what people lived\\nand ate bread in this land. They disembarked\\nand walked along a smooth path, where the wagons\\nbrought wood down from the mountains to the city.\\nThey met a girl in front of town, out fetching\\nsome water. She was heading for the fountain\\nof Artaky, the whole town’s water source.\\nShe was the strapping child of Antiphates,\\nking of the Laestrygonians. They asked her\\nabout the king and people of the country. \\nShe promptly took them to the high-roofed palace\\nof her own father. When they went inside\\nthey found a woman, mountain-high. They were\\nappalled and shocked. The giantess at once\\nsummoned the king her husband from the council;\\nhe tried to kill my men, and grabbing one\\nhe ate him up. The other two escaped,\\nback to the ship. The king’s shout boomed through town.\\nHearing, the mighty Laestrygonians\\nthronged from all sides, not humanlike, but giants. \\nWith boulders bigger than a man could lift\\nthey pelted at us from the cliﬀs. We heard\\nthe dreadful uproar of ships being broken\\nand dying men. They speared them there like fish.\\nA gruesome meal! While they were killing them\\ninside the harbor, I drew out my sword\\nand cut the ropes that moored my dark-cheeked ship,\\nand yelling to my men, I told them, ‘Row\\nas fast as possible away from danger!’\\nThey rowed at double time, afraid to die. \\nMy ship was lucky and we reached the sea\\nbeyond the overhanging cliﬀs. The rest,\\ntrapped in the bay together, were destroyed.\\nWe sailed oﬀ sadly, happy to survive,\\nbut with our good friends lost. We reached Aeaea,\\nhome of the beautiful, dreadful goddess Circe,\\nwho speaks in human languages—the sister\\nof Aeetes whose mind is set on ruin.\\nThose two are children of the Sun who shines\\non mortals, and of Perse, child of Ocean. \\nUnder the guidance of some god we drifted\\nsilently to the harbor, and we moored there.\\nFor two days and two nights we lay onshore,\\nexhausted and our hearts consumed with grief.\\nOn the third morning brought by braided Dawn,\\nI took my spear and sharp sword, and I ran\\nup from the ship to higher ground, to look\\nfor signs of humans, listening for voices.\\nI climbed up to a crag, and I saw smoke\\nrising from Circe’s palace, from the earth \\nup through the woods and thickets. I considered\\nif I should go down and investigate,\\nsince I had seen the smoke. But I decided\\nto go back down first, to the beach and ship\\nand feed my men, and then set out to scout.\\nWhen I had almost reached my ship, some god\\ntook pity on me in my loneliness,\\nand sent a mighty stag with great tall antlers\\nto cross my path. He ran down from the forest\\nto drink out of the river; it was hot. \\nI struck him in the middle of his back;\\nmy bronze spear pierced him. With a moan, he fell\\nonto the dust; his spirit flew away.\\nI stepped on him and tugged my bronze spear out,\\nand left it on the ground, while I plucked twigs\\nand twines, and wove a rope, a fathom’s length,\\nwell knotted all the way along, and bound\\nthe hooves of that huge animal. I went\\ndown to my dark ship with him on my back.\\nI used my spear to lean on, since the stag \\nwas too big to be lugged across one shoulder.\\nI dumped him down before the ship and made\\na comforting pep talk to cheer my men.\\n‘My friends! We will not yet go down to Hades,\\nsad though we are, before our fated day.\\nCome on, since we have food and drink on board,\\nlet us not starve ourselves; now time to eat!’\\nThey quickly heeded my commands, and took\\ntheir cloaks down from their faces, and they marveled\\nto see the big stag lying on the beach. \\nIt was enormous. When they finished staring,\\nthey washed their hands and cooked a splendid meal.\\nSo all that day till sunset we sat eating\\nthe meat aplenty and the strong sweet wine.\\nWhen darkness fell, we went to sleep beside\\nthe seashore. Then the roses of Dawn’s fingers\\nappeared again; I called my men and told them,\\n‘Listen to me, my friends, despite your grief.\\nWe do not know where darkness lives, nor dawn,\\nnor where the sun that shines upon the world \\ngoes underneath the earth, nor where it rises.\\nWe need a way to fix our current plight,\\nbut I do not know how. I climbed the rocks\\nto higher ground to look around. This is\\nan island, wreathed about by boundless sea.\\nThe land lies low. I saw smoke in the middle,\\nrising up through the forest and thick bush.’\\nAt that, their hearts sank, since they all remembered\\nwhat happened with the Laestrygonians,\\ntheir King Antiphates, and how the mighty \\nCyclops devoured the men. They wept and wailed,\\nand shed great floods of tears. But all that grieving\\ncould do no good. I made them wear their armor,\\nand split them in two groups. I led one,\\nand made godlike Eurylochus lead the other.\\nWe shook the lots in a helmet made of bronze;\\nEurylochus’ lot jumped out. So he\\nwent with his band of twenty-two, all weeping.\\nThose left behind with me were crying too.\\nInside the glade they found the house of Circe \\nbuilt out of polished stones, on high foundations.\\nRound it were mountain wolves and lions, which\\nshe tamed with drugs. They did not rush on them,\\nbut gathered around them in a friendly way,\\ntheir long tails wagging, as dogs nuzzle round\\ntheir master when he comes back home from dinner\\nwith treats for them. Just so, those sharp-clawed wolves\\nand lions, mighty beasts, came snuggling up.\\nThe men were terrified. They stood outside\\nand heard some lovely singing. It was Circe, \\nthe goddess. She was weaving as she sang,\\nan intricate, enchanting piece of work,\\nthe kind a goddess fashions. Then Polites,\\nmy most devoted and most loyal man,\\na leader to his peers, said,\\n‘Friends, inside\\nsomeone is weaving on that massive loom,\\nand singing so the floor resounds. Perhaps\\na woman, or a goddess. Let us call her.’\\nThey shouted out to her. She came at once,\\nopened the shining doors, and asked them in. \\nSo thinking nothing of it, in they went.\\nEurylochus alone remained outside,\\nsuspecting trickery. She led them in,\\nsat them on chairs, and blended them a potion\\nof barley, cheese, and golden honey, mixed\\nwith Pramnian wine. She added potent drugs\\nto make them totally forget their home.\\nThey took and drank the mixture. Then she struck them,\\nusing her magic wand, and penned them in\\nthe pigsty. They were turned to pigs in body \\nand voice and hair; their minds remained the same.\\nThey squealed at their imprisonment, and Circe\\nthrew them some mast and cornel cherries—food\\nthat pigs like rooting for in muddy ground.\\nEurylochus ran back to our black ship,\\nto tell us of the terrible disaster\\nthat happened to his friends. He tried to speak,\\nbut could not, overwhelmed by grief. His eyes\\nwere full of tears, his heart was pierced with sorrow.\\nAstonished, we all questioned him. At last \\nhe spoke about what happened to the others.\\n‘Odysseus, we went oﬀ through the woods,\\nas you commanded. In the glade we found\\na beautiful tall house of polished stone.\\nWe heard a voice: a woman or a goddess\\nwas singing as she worked her loom. My friends\\ncalled out to her. She opened up the doors,\\ninviting them inside. Suspecting nothing,\\nthey followed her. But I stayed there outside,\\nfearing some trick. Then all at once, they vanished. \\nI sat there for a while to watch and wait,\\nbut none of them came back.’\\nAt this, I strapped\\nmy silver-studded sword across my back,\\ntook up my bow, and told him, ‘Take me there.’\\nHe grasped my knees and begged me tearfully,\\n‘No no, my lord! Please do not make me go!\\nLet me stay here! You cannot bring them back,\\nand you will not return here if you try.\\nHurry, we must escape with these men here!\\nWe have a chance to save our lives!’\\nI said, \\n‘You can stay here beside the ship and eat\\nand drink. But I will go. I must do this.’\\nI left the ship and shore, and walked on up,\\ncrossing the sacred glades, and I had almost\\nreached the great house of the enchantress Circe,\\nwhen I met Hermes, carrying his wand\\nof gold. He seemed an adolescent boy,\\nthe cutest age, when beards first start to grow.\\nHe took my hand and said,\\n‘Why have you come\\nacross these hills alone? You do not know \\nthis place, poor man. Your men were turned to pigs\\nin Circe’s house, and crammed in pens. Do you\\nimagine you can set them free? You cannot.\\nIf you try that, you will not get back home.\\nYou will stay here with them. But I can help you.\\nHere, take this antidote to keep you safe\\nwhen you go into Circe’s house. Now I\\nwill tell you all her lethal spells and tricks.\\nShe will make you a potion mixed with poison.\\nIts magic will not work on you because \\nyou have the herb I gave you. When she strikes you\\nwith her long wand, then draw your sharpened sword\\nand rush at her as if you mean to kill her.\\nShe will be frightened of you, and will tell you\\nto sleep with her. Do not hold out against her—\\nshe is a goddess. If you sleep with her,\\nyou will set free your friends and save yourself.\\nTell her to swear an oath by all the gods\\nthat she will not plot further harm for you—\\nor while you have your clothes oﬀ, she may hurt you, \\nunmanning you.’\\nThe bright mercurial god\\npulled from the ground a plant and showed me how\\nits root is black, its flower white as milk.\\nThe gods call this plant Moly. It is hard\\nfor mortal men to dig it up, but gods\\nare able to do everything. Then Hermes\\nflew through the wooded island, back towards\\nhigh Mount Olympus. I went in the house\\nof Circe. My heart pounded as I walked.\\nI stood there at the doorway, and I saw her, \\nthe lovely Circe with her braided hair.\\nI called; she heard and opened up the doors\\nand asked me in. I followed nervously.\\nShe led me to a silver-studded chair,\\nall finely crafted, with a footstool under.\\nIn a gold cup she mixed a drink for me,\\nadding the drug—she hoped to do me harm.\\nI sipped it, but the magic did not work.\\nShe struck me with her wand and said,\\n‘Now go!\\nOut to the sty, and lie there with your men!’ \\nBut I drew my sharp sword from by my thigh\\nand leapt at her as if I meant to kill her.\\nShe screamed and ducked beneath the sword, and\\ngrasped\\nmy knees, and wailing asked me,\\n‘Who are you?\\nWhere is your city? And who are your parents?\\nI am amazed that you could drink my potion\\nand yet not be bewitched. No other man\\nhas drunk it and withstood the magic charm.\\nBut you are diﬀerent. Your mind is not\\nenchanted. You must be Odysseus, \\nthe man who can adapt to anything.\\nBright flashing Hermes of the golden wand\\nhas often told me that you would sail here\\nfrom Troy in your swift ship. Now sheathe your sword\\nand come to bed with me. Through making love\\nwe may begin to trust each other more.’\\nI answered, ‘Circe! How can you command me\\nto treat you gently, when you turned my men\\nto pigs, and you are planning to play tricks\\nin telling me to come to bed with you, \\nso you can take my courage and my manhood\\nwhen you have got me naked? I refuse\\nto come to bed with you, unless you swear\\na mighty oath that you will not form plans\\nto hurt me anymore.’\\nWhen I said that,\\nat once she made the oath as I had asked.\\nShe vowed and formed the oath, and then at last\\nI went up to the dazzling bed of Circe.\\nMeanwhile, four slaves, her house girls, were at work\\naround the palace. They were nymphs, the daughters \\nof fountains and of groves and holy rivers\\nthat flow into the sea. One set fine cloths\\nof purple on the chairs, with stones beneath them.\\nBeside each chair, another pulled up tables\\nof silver and set golden baskets on them.\\nThe third mixed up inside a silver bowl\\nsweet, cheering wine, and poured it in gold cups.\\nThe fourth brought water, and she lit a fire\\nbeneath a mighty tripod, till it boiled.\\nIt started bubbling in the copper cauldron; \\nshe took me to the bathtub, and began\\nto wash my head and shoulders, using water\\nmixed to the perfect temperature, to take\\nmy deep soul-crushing weariness away.\\nAfter the bath, she oiled my skin and dressed me\\nin fine wool cloak and tunic, and she led me\\nto a silver-studded well-carved chair, and set\\na footstool underneath. Another slave\\nbrought water for my hands, in a gold pitcher,\\nand poured it over them, to a silver bowl. \\nShe set a polished table near. The cook\\nbrought bread and laid a generous feast, and Circe\\ntold me to eat. But my heart was unwilling.\\nI sat there with my mind on other things;\\nI had forebodings. Circe noticed me\\nsitting, not touching food, and weighed by grief.\\nShe stood near me and asked, ‘Odysseus!\\nwhy are you sitting there so silently,\\nlike someone mute, eating your heart, not touching\\nthe banquet or the wine? You need not fear. \\nRemember, I already swore an oath.’\\nBut I said, ‘Circe, no! What decent man\\ncould bear to taste his food or sip his wine\\nbefore he saw his men with his own eyes,\\nand set them free? If you are so insistent\\non telling me to eat and drink, then free them,\\nso I may see with my own eyes my crew\\nof loyal men.’\\nSo Circe left the hall\\nholding her wand, and opened up the pigsty\\nand drove them out, still looking like fat boars, \\nlarge and full grown. They stood in front of her.\\nMajestic Lady Circe walked among them,\\nanointing each with some new drug. The potion\\nhad made thick hog-hairs sprout out on their bodies.\\nThose bristles all flew oﬀ and they were men,\\nbut younger than before, and much more handsome,\\nand taller. Then they recognized me. Each\\nembraced me tightly in his arms, and started\\nsobbing in desperation. So the house\\nrang loud with noise, and even she herself \\npitied them. She came near to me and said,\\n‘Odysseus, you always find solutions.\\nGo now to your swift ship beside the sea.\\nFirst drag the ship to land, and bring your stores\\nand all your gear inside the caves. Then come\\nback with your loyal men.’\\nMy heart agreed;\\nI went down to my swift ship on the shore.\\nI found my loyal men beside the ship,\\nweeping and shedding floods of tears. As when\\na herd of cows is coming back from pasture \\ninto the yard; and all the little heifers\\njump from their pens to skip and run towards\\ntheir mothers, and they cluster round them, mooing;\\njust so my men, as soon as they saw me,\\nbegan to weep, and in their minds it seemed\\nas if they had arrived in their own home,\\nthe land of rugged Ithaca, where they\\nwere born and raised. Still sobbing, they cried out,\\n‘Oh, Master! We are glad to see you back!\\nIt is as if we had come home ourselves, \\nto Ithaca, our fatherland. But tell us\\nabout how all our other friends were killed.’\\nI reassured them, saying, ‘First we must\\ndrag up the ship to land, and put the stores\\nand all our gear inside the caves; then hurry,\\nall of you, come with me, and see your friends\\ninside the goddess Circe’s holy house,\\neating and drinking; they have food enough\\nto last forever.’\\nThey believed my story,\\nwith the exception of Eurylochus, \\nwho warned them,\\n‘Fools! Why would you go up there?\\nWhy would you choose to take on so much danger,\\nto enter Circe’s house, where she will turn us\\nto pigs or wolves or lions, all of us,\\nforced to protect her mighty house for her?\\nRemember what the Cyclops did? Our friends\\nwent to his home with this rash lord of ours.\\nBecause of his bad choices, they all died.’\\nAt that, I thought of drawing my long sword\\nfrom by my sturdy thigh, to cut his head oﬀ \\nand let it fall down to the ground—although\\nhe was close family. My men restrained me,\\nsaying to me, ‘No, king, please let him go!\\nLet him stay here and guard the ship, and we\\nwill follow you to Circe’s holy house.’\\nSo they went up, away from ship and shore.\\nEurylochus did not stay there; he came,\\nfearing my angry scolding.\\nMeanwhile Circe\\nhad freed the other men, and in her house\\nshe gently bathed them, rubbing them with oil. \\nShe had them dressed in woolen cloaks and tunics.\\nWe found them feasting in the hall. The men,\\nseeing each other face-to-face again,\\nbegan to weep; their sobbing filled the hall.\\nThe goddess stood beside me and said,\\n‘King,\\nclever Odysseus, Laertes’ son,\\nnow stop encouraging this lamentation.\\nI know you and your men have suﬀered greatly,\\nout on the fish-filled sea, and on dry land\\nfrom hostile men. But it is time to eat \\nand drink some wine. You must get back the drive\\nyou had when you set out from Ithaca.\\nYou are worn down and brokenhearted, always\\ndwelling on pain and wandering. You never\\nfeel joy at heart. You have endured too much.’\\nWe did as she had said. Then every day\\nfor a whole year we feasted there on meat\\nand sweet strong wine. But when the year was over,\\nwhen months had waned and seasons turned, and each\\nlong day had passed its course, my loyal men \\ncalled me and said,\\n‘Be guided by the gods.\\nNow it is time to think of our own country,\\nif you are fated to survive and reach\\nyour high-roofed house and your forefathers’ land.’\\nMy warrior soul agreed. So all day long\\ntill sunset we kept sitting at the feast\\nof meat and sweet strong wine. But when the sun\\nset, and the darkness came, they went to bed\\nall through the shadowy palace. I went up\\nto Circe’s splendid bed, and touched her knees \\nin supplication, and the goddess listened.\\n‘Circe,’ I said, ‘Fulfill the vow you made\\nto send me home. My heart now longs to go.\\nMy men are also desperate to leave.\\nWhenever you are absent, they exhaust me\\nwith constant lamentation.’\\nAnd she answered,\\n‘Laertes’ son, great King Odysseus,\\nmaster of every challenge, you need not\\nremain here in my house against your will.\\nBut first you must complete another journey. \\nGo to the house of Hades and the dreadful\\nPersephone, and ask the Theban prophet,\\nthe blind Tiresias, for his advice.\\nPersephone has given him alone\\nfull understanding, even now in death.\\nThe other spirits flit around as shadows.’\\nThat broke my heart, and sitting on the bed\\nI wept, and lost all will to live and see\\nthe shining sun. When I was done with sobbing\\nand rolling round in grief, I said to her, \\n‘But Circe, who can guide us on this journey?\\nNo one before has ever sailed to Hades\\nby ship.’\\nAnd right away the goddess answered,\\n‘You are resourceful, King Odysseus.\\nYou need not worry that you have no pilot\\nto steer your ship. Set up your mast, let fly\\nyour white sails, and sit down. The North Wind’s breath\\nwill blow the ship. When you have crossed the stream\\nof Ocean, you will reach the shore, where willows\\nlet fall their dying fruit, and towering poplars \\ngrow in the forest of Persephone.\\nTie up your ship in the deep-eddying Ocean,\\nand go into the spacious home of Hades.\\nThe Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus,\\na tributary of the Styx, both run\\ninto the Acheron. The flowing water\\nresounds beside the rock. Brave man, go there,\\nand dig a hole a cubit wide and long,\\nand round it pour libations for the dead:\\nfirst honey-mix, then sweet wine, and the third \\nof water. Sprinkle barley, and beseech\\nthe spirits of the dead. Vow if you reach\\nthe barren land of Ithaca, to kill\\na heifer in your halls, the best you have,\\nuncalved, and you will heap the fire with meat,\\nand oﬀer to Tiresias alone\\na ram, pure black, the best of all your flock.\\nWhen you have prayed to all the famous dead,\\nslaughter one ram and one black ewe, directing\\nthe animals to Erebus, but turn \\nyourself away, towards the gushing river.\\nMany will come. Then tell your men to skin\\nthe sheep that lie there killed by ruthless bronze,\\nand burn them, with a prayer to mighty Hades\\nand terrible Persephone. Then draw\\nyour sword and sit. Do not let them come near\\nthe blood, until you hear Tiresias.\\nThe prophet will soon come, and he will tell you\\nabout your journey, measured out across\\nthe fish-filled sea, and how you will get home.’ \\nDawn on her golden throne began to shine,\\nand Circe dressed me in my cloak and tunic.\\nThe goddess wore a long white dress, of fine\\nand delicate fabric, with a golden belt,\\nand on her head, a veil. Then I walked round,\\nall through the house, and called my men. I stood\\nbeside each one, and roused them with my words.\\n‘Wake up! Now no more dozing in sweet sleep.\\nWe have to go. The goddess gave instructions.’\\nThey did as I had said. But even then \\nI could not lead my men away unharmed.\\nThe youngest one—Elpenor was his name—\\nnot very brave in war, nor very smart,\\nwas lying high up in the home of Circe,\\napart from his companions, seeking coolness\\nsince he was drunk. He heard the noise and bustle,\\nthe movements of his friends, and jumped up quickly,\\nforgetting to climb down the lofty ladder.\\nHe fell down crashing headlong from the roof,\\nand broke his neck, right at the spine. His spirit \\nwent down to Hades.\\nThen I told the others,\\n‘Perhaps you think that you are going home.\\nBut Circe says we have to go towards\\nthe house of Hades and Persephone,\\nto meet Tiresias, the Theban spirit.’\\nAt that, their hearts were broken. They sat down\\nright there and wept and tore their clothes. But all\\ntheir lamentation did no good. We went\\ndown to our speedy ship beside the sea,\\ndespite our grief. We shed abundant tears. \\nThen Circe came and tied up one black ewe\\nand one ram by the ship, and slipped away,\\neasily; who can see the gods go by\\nunless they wish to show themselves to us?”\\nBOOK \\nThe Dead\\n“We reached the sea and first of all we launched\\nthe ship into the sparkling salty water,\\nset up the mast and sails, and brought the sheep\\non board with us. We were still grieving, weeping,\\nin floods of tears. But beautiful, dread Circe,\\nthe goddess who can speak in human tongues,\\nsent us a wind to fill our sails, fair wind\\nbefriending us behind the dark blue prow.\\nWe made our tackle shipshape, then sat down.\\nThe wind and pilot guided straight our course. \\nThe sun set. It was dark in all directions.\\nWe reached the limits of deep-flowing Ocean,\\nwhere the Cimmerians live and have their city.\\nTheir land is covered up in mist and cloud;\\nthe shining Sun God never looks on them\\nwith his bright beams—not when he rises up\\ninto the starry sky, nor when he turns\\nback from the heavens to earth. Destructive night\\nblankets the world for all poor mortals there.\\nWe beached our ship, drove out the sheep, and went \\nto seek the stream of Ocean where the goddess\\nhad told us we must go. Eurylochus\\nand Perimedes made the sacrifice.\\nI drew my sword and dug a hole, a fathom\\nwidthways and lengthways, and I poured libations\\nfor all the dead: first honey-mix, sweet wine,\\nand lastly, water. On the top, I sprinkled\\nbarley, and made a solemn vow that if\\nI reached my homeland, I would sacrifice\\nmy best young heifer, still uncalved, and pile \\nthe altar high with oﬀerings for the dead.\\nI promised for Tiresias as well\\na pure black sheep, the best in all my flock.\\nSo with these vows, I called upon the dead.\\nI took the sheep and slit their throats above\\nthe pit. Black blood flowed out. The spirits came\\nup out of Erebus and gathered round.\\nTeenagers, girls and boys, the old who suﬀered\\nfor many years, and fresh young brides whom labor\\ndestroyed in youth; and many men cut down \\nin battle by bronze spears, still dressed in armor\\nstained with their blood. From every side they crowded\\naround the pit, with eerie cries. Pale fear\\ntook hold of me. I roused my men and told them\\nto flay the sheep that I had killed, and burn them,\\nand pray to Hades and Persephone.\\nI drew my sword and sat on guard, preventing\\nthe spirits of the dead from coming near\\nthe blood, till I had met Tiresias.\\nFirst came the spirit of my man Elpenor, \\nwho had not yet been buried in the earth.\\nWe left his body in the house of Circe\\nwithout a funeral or burial;\\nwe were too occupied with other things.\\nOn sight of him, I wept in pity, saying,\\n‘Elpenor, how did you come here, in darkness?\\nYou came on foot more quickly than I sailed.’\\nHe groaned in answer, ‘Lord Odysseus,\\nyou master every circumstance. But I\\nhad bad luck from some god, and too much wine \\nbefuddled me. In Circe’s house I lay\\nupstairs, and I forgot to use the ladder\\nto climb down from the roof. I fell headfirst;\\nmy neck was broken from my spine. My spirit\\ncame down to Hades. By the men you left,\\nthe absent ones! And by your wife! And father,\\nwho brought you up from babyhood! And by\\nyour son, Telemachus, whom you abandoned\\nalone at home, I beg you! When you sail\\nfrom Hades and you dock your ship again \\nat Aeaea, please my lord, remember me.\\nDo not go on and leave me there unburied,\\nabandoned, without tears or lamentation—\\nor you will make the gods enraged at you.\\nBurn me with all my arms, and heap a mound\\nbeside the gray salt sea, so in the future\\npeople will know of me and my misfortune.\\nAnd fix into the tomb the oar I used\\nto row with my companions while I lived.’\\n‘Poor man!’ I answered, ‘I will do all this.’ \\nWe sat there talking sadly—I on one side\\nheld firm my sword in blood, while on the other\\nthe ghost of my crew member made his speech.\\nThen came the spirit of my own dead mother,\\nAutolycus’ daughter Anticleia,\\nwhom I had left alive when I went oﬀ\\nto holy Troy. On seeing her, I wept\\nin pity. But despite my bitter grief,\\nI would not let her near the blood till I\\ntalked to Tiresias. The prophet came \\nholding a golden scepter, and he knew me,\\nand said,\\n‘King under Zeus, Odysseus,\\nadept survivor, why did you abandon\\nthe sun, poor man, to see the dead, and this\\nplace without joy? Step back now from the pit,\\nhold up your sharp sword so that I may drink\\nthe blood and speak to you.’\\nAt that, I sheathed\\nmy silver-studded sword. When he had drunk\\nthe murky blood, the famous prophet spoke.\\n‘Odysseus, you think of going home \\nas honey-sweet, but gods will make it bitter.\\nI think Poseidon will not cease to feel\\nincensed because you blinded his dear son.\\nYou have to suﬀer, but you can get home,\\nif you control your urges and your men.\\nTurn from the purple depths and sail your ship\\ntowards the island of Thrinacia; there\\nyou will find grazing cows and fine fat sheep,\\nbelonging to the god who sees and hears\\nall things—the Sun God. If you leave them be, \\nkeeping your mind fixed on your journey home,\\nyou may still get to Ithaca, despite\\ngreat losses. But if you hurt those cows, I see\\ndisaster for your ship and for your men.\\nIf you yourself escape, you will come home\\nlate and exhausted, in a stranger’s boat,\\nhaving destroyed your men. And you will find\\ninvaders eating your supplies at home,\\ncourting your wife with gifts. Then you will match\\nthe suitors’ violence and kill them all, \\ninside your halls, through tricks or in the open,\\nwith sharp bronze weapons. When those men are dead,\\nyou have to go away and take an oar\\nto people with no knowledge of the sea,\\nwho do not salt their food. They never saw\\na ship’s red prow, nor oars, the wings of boats.\\nI prophesy the signs of things to come.\\nWhen you meet somebody, a traveler,\\nwho calls the thing you carry on your back\\na winnowing fan, then fix that oar in earth \\nand make fine sacrifices to Poseidon—\\na bull and stud-boar. Then you will go home\\nand oﬀer holy hecatombs to all\\nthe deathless gods who live in heaven, each\\nin order. Gentle death will come to you,\\nfar from the sea, of comfortable old age,\\nyour people flourishing. So it will be.’\\nI said, ‘Tiresias, I hope the gods\\nspin out this fate for me. But tell me this,\\nand tell the truth. I saw my mother’s spirit, \\nsitting in silence near the blood, refusing\\neven to talk to me, or meet my eyes!\\nMy lord, how can I make her recognize\\nthat it is me?’\\nAt once he made his answer.\\n‘That is an easy matter to explain.\\nWhenever you allow one of these spirits\\nto come here near the blood, it will be able\\nto speak the truth to you. As soon as you\\npush them away, they have to leave again.’\\nWith that, Tiresias, the prophet spirit, \\nwas finished; he departed to the house\\nof Hades. I stayed rooted there in place\\nuntil my mother came and drank the blood.\\nShe knew me then and spoke in tones of grief.\\n‘My child! How did you come here through the darkness\\nwhile you were still alive? This place is hard\\nfor living men to see. There are great rivers\\nand dreadful gulfs, including the great Ocean\\nwhich none can cross on foot; one needs a ship.\\nHave you come wandering here, so far from Troy, \\nwith ship and crew? Have you not yet arrived\\nin Ithaca, nor seen your wife at home?’\\nI answered, ‘Mother, I was forced to come\\nto Hades to consult the prophet spirit,\\nTheban Tiresias. I have not yet\\ncome near to Greece, nor reached my own home\\ncountry.\\nI have been lost and wretchedly unhappy\\nsince I first followed mighty Agamemnon\\nto Troy, the land of horses, to make war\\nupon the people there. But tell me, how \\nwas sad death brought upon you? By long illness?\\nOr did the archer Artemis destroy you\\nwith gentle arrows? Tell me too about\\nmy father and the son I left behind.\\nAre they still honored as the kings? Or has\\nanother taken over, saying I\\nwill not return? And tell me what my wife\\nis thinking, and her plans. Does she stay with\\nour son and focus on his care, or has\\nthe best of the Achaeans married her?’ \\nMy mother answered, ‘She stays firm. Her heart\\nis strong. She is still in your house. And all\\nher nights are passed in misery, and days\\nin tears. But no one has usurped your throne.\\nTelemachus still tends the whole estate\\nunharmed and feasts in style, as lords should do,\\nand he is always asked to council meetings.\\nYour father stays out in the countryside.\\nHe will not come to town. He does not sleep\\non a real bed with blankets and fresh sheets. \\nIn winter he sleeps inside, by the fire,\\njust lying in the ashes with the slaves;\\nhis clothes are rags. In summer and at harvest,\\nthe piles of fallen leaves are beds for him.\\nHe lies there grieving, full of sorrow, longing\\nfor your return. His old age is not easy.\\nAnd that is why I met my fate and died.\\nThe goddess did not shoot me in my home,\\naiming with gentle arrows. Nor did sickness\\nsuck all the strength out from my limbs, with long \\nand cruel wasting. No, it was missing you,\\nOdysseus, my sunshine; your sharp mind,\\nand your kind heart. That took sweet life from me.’\\nThen in my heart I wanted to embrace\\nthe spirit of my mother. She was dead,\\nand I did not know how. Three times I tried,\\nlonging to touch her. But three times her ghost\\nflew from my arms, like shadows or like dreams.\\nSharp pain pierced deeper in me as I cried,\\n‘No, Mother! Why do you not stay for me, \\nand let me hold you, even here in Hades?\\nLet us wrap loving arms around each other\\nand find a frigid comfort in shared tears!\\nBut is this really you? Or has the Queen\\nsent me a phantom, to increase my grief?’\\nShe answered, ‘Oh, my child! You are the most\\nunlucky man alive. Persephone\\nis not deceiving you. This is the rule\\nfor mortals when we die. Our muscles cease\\nto hold the flesh and skeleton together; \\nas soon as life departs from our white bones,\\nthe force of blazing fire destroys the corpse.\\nThe spirit flies away and soon is gone,\\njust like a dream. Now hurry to the light;\\nremember all these things, so you may tell\\nyour wife in times to come.’\\nAs we were talking,\\nsome women came, sent by Persephone—\\nthe daughters and the wives of warriors.\\nThey thronged and clustered round the blood. I wanted\\nto speak to each of them, and made a plan. \\nI drew my sword and would not let them come\\ntogether in a group to drink the blood.\\nThey took turns coming forward, and each told\\nher history; I questioned each. The first\\nwas well-born Tyro, child of Salmoneus,\\nand wife of Cretheus, Aeolus’ son.\\nShe fell in love with River Enipeus,\\nmost handsome of all rivers that pour water\\nover the earth. She often went to visit\\nhis lovely streams. Poseidon took his form, \\nand at the river mouth he lay with her.\\nAround them arched a dark-blue wave that stood\\nhigh as a mountain, and it hid the god\\nand mortal woman. There he loosed her belt\\nand made her sleep. The god made love to her,\\nand afterwards, he took her hand and spoke.\\n‘Woman, be glad about this love. You will\\nbear glorious children in the coming year.\\nAﬀairs with gods always result in oﬀspring.\\nLook after them and raise them. Now go home; \\ntell no one who I am. But I will tell you.\\nI am Poseidon, Shaker of the Earth.’\\nWith that he sank beneath the ocean waves.\\nShe brought two sons to term, named Pelias\\nand Neleus, both sturdy boys who served\\nalmighty Zeus; and Pelias’ home\\nwas on the spacious dancing fields of Iolcus,\\nwhere sheep are plentiful; his brother lived\\nin sandy Pylos. And she bore more sons,\\nto Cretheus: Aeson, Pheres, Amythaeon \\nwho loved war chariots.\\nAnd after her\\nI saw Antiope, who said she slept\\nin Zeus’ arms and bore two sons: Amphion\\nand Zethus, the first settlers of Thebes,\\ncity of seven gates. Strong though they were,\\nthey could not live there on the open plain\\nwithout defenses.\\nThen I saw Alcmene,\\nwife of Amphitryon, who by great Zeus\\nconceived the lionhearted Heracles.\\nAnd I saw Megara, proud Creon’s child, \\nthe wife of tireless Heracles. I saw\\nfine Epicaste, Oedipus’ mother,\\nwho did a dreadful thing in ignorance:\\nshe married her own son. He killed his father,\\nand married her. The gods revealed the truth\\nto humans; through their deadly plans, he ruled\\nthe Cadmeans in Thebes, despite his pain.\\nBut Epicaste crossed the gates of Hades;\\nshe tied a noose and hung it from the ceiling,\\nand hanged herself for sorrow, leaving him \\nthe agonies a mother’s Furies bring.\\nThen I saw Chloris, who was youngest daughter\\nof Amphion, who ruled the Minyans\\nin Orchomenus. She was beautiful,\\nand Neleus paid rich bride-gifts for her.\\nShe was the queen in Pylos, and she bore\\nChromius, Nestor, Periclymenus,\\nand mighty Pyro, who was such a marvel\\nthat all the men desired to marry her.\\nBut Neleus would only let her marry \\na man who could drive oﬀ the stubborn cattle\\nof Iphicles from Phylace. The prophet\\nMelampus was the only one who tried,\\nbut gods restrained him, cursing him; the herdsmen\\nshackled him. Days and months went by, the seasons\\nchanged as the year went by, until at last\\nIphicles set him free as his reward\\nfor prophecy. The will of Zeus was done.\\nAnd then I saw Tyndareus’ wife,\\nLeda, who bore him two strong sons: the horseman \\nCastor, and Polydeuces, skillful boxer.\\nLife-giving earth contains them, still alive.\\nZeus honors them even in the underworld.\\nThey live and die alternately, and they\\nare honored like the gods.\\nAnd then I saw\\nIphimedeia, wife of Aloeus,\\nwho proudly said Poseidon slept with her.\\nShe had two sons whose lives were both cut short:\\nOtus and famous Ephialtes, whom\\nthe fertile earth raised up as the tallest heroes \\nafter renowned Orion. At nine years,\\nthey were nine cubits wide, nine fathoms high.\\nThey brought the din of dreadful raging war\\nto the immortal gods and tried to set\\nOssa and Pelion—trees, leaves and all—\\non Mount Olympus, high up in the sky.\\nThey might have managed it, if they had reached\\nfull adulthood. Apollo, son of Zeus\\nby braided Leto, killed them: they were both\\ndead before down could grow on their young chins, \\ndead before beards could wreathe their naked faces.\\nThen I saw Phaedra, Procris, and the lovely\\ndaughter of dangerous Minos, Ariadne.\\nTheseus tried to bring her back from Crete\\nto Athens, but could not succeed; the goddess\\nArtemis killed her on the isle of Dia,\\nwhen Dionysus spoke against her. Then\\ncame Maera, Clymene and Eriphyle:\\naccepting golden bribes, she killed her husband.\\nI cannot name each famous wife and daughter \\nI saw there; holy night would pass away\\nbefore I finished. I must go to sleep\\non board the ship beside my crew, or else\\nright here. I know the gods and you will help\\nmy onward journey.”\\nThey were silent, spellbound,\\nlistening in the shadowy hall. White-armed\\nArete spoke.\\n“Phaeacians! Look at him!\\nWhat a tall, handsome man! And what a mind!\\nHe is my special guest, but all of you\\nshare in our rank as lords; so do not send him \\naway too fast, and when he leaves, you must\\nbe generous. He is in need, and you\\nare rich in treasure, through the will of gods.”\\nThe veteran Echeneus, the oldest\\nman in their company, said, “Our wise queen\\nhas hit the mark, my friends. Do as she says.\\nBut first Alcinous must speak and act.”\\nThe king said, “Let it be as she has spoken,\\nas long as I am ruler of this nation\\nof seafarers. I know our guest is keen \\nto go back home, but let him stay till morning.\\nI will give all his presents then. You men\\nwill all help him, but I will help the most,\\nsince I hold power here.”\\nOdysseus\\nanswered with careful tact, “Alcinous,\\nking over all the people, if you urged me\\nto stay here for a year before you gave\\nthe parting gifts and sent me on my way,\\nI would be happy. It would be far better\\nto reach my own dear home with hands filled full \\nof treasure. So all men would honor me\\nand welcome me back home in Ithaca.”\\nAlcinous replied, “Odysseus,\\nthe earth sustains all diﬀerent kinds of people.\\nMany are cheats and thieves, who fashion lies\\nout of thin air. But when I look at you,\\nI know you are not in that category.\\nYour story has both grace and wisdom in it.\\nYou sounded like a skillful poet, telling\\nthe suﬀerings of all the Greeks, including \\nwhat you endured yourself. But come now, tell me\\nif you saw any spirits of your friends,\\nwho went with you to Troy and undertook\\nthe grief and pain of war. The night is long;\\nit is not time to sleep yet. Tell me more\\namazing deeds! I would keep listening\\nuntil bright daybreak, if you kept on telling\\nthe dangers you have passed.”\\nOdysseus\\nanswered politely, “King Alcinous,\\nit is a time for many tales, but also \\na time for sleep. If you still want to hear,\\nI will not grudge you stories. I will tell you\\nsome even more distressing ones, about\\nmy friend who managed to escape the shrieks\\nand battle din at Troy but perished later,\\nkilled in his own home by an evil wife.\\nHoly Persephone dispersed the ghosts\\nof women and they went their separate ways.\\nThe ghost of Agamemnon came in sorrow\\nwith all the rest who met their fate with him \\ninside Aegisthus’ house. He recognized me\\nwhen he had drunk the blood. He wept out loud,\\nand tearfully reached out his hands towards me,\\ndesperate to touch. His energy and strength\\nand all the suppleness his limbs once had\\nwere gone. I wept and my heart pitied him.\\nI cried out,\\n‘Lord of men, King Agamemnon!\\nHow did you die? What bad luck brought you down?\\nWas it Poseidon rousing up a blast\\nof cruel wind to wreck your ships? Or were you \\nkilled on dry land by enemies as you\\nwere poaching their fat flocks of sheep or cattle,\\nor fighting for their city and their wives?’\\nHe answered right away, ‘King under Zeus,\\nOdysseus—survivor! No, Poseidon\\ndid not rouse up a dreadful blast of wind\\nto wreck my ship. No hostile men on land\\nkilled me in self-defense. It was Aegisthus\\nwho planned my death and murdered me, with help\\nfrom my own wife. He called me to his house \\nto dinner and he killed me, as one slaughters\\nan ox at manger. What a dreadful death!\\nMy men were systematically slaughtered\\nlike pigs in a rich lord’s house for some feast,\\na wedding or a banquet. You have seen\\nmany cut down in war in thick of battle,\\nor slaughtered in a combat hand to hand;\\nbut you would grieve with even deeper pity\\nif you could see us lying dead beneath\\nthe tables piled with food and wine. The floor \\nswam thick with blood. I heard the desperate voice\\nof Priam’s daughter, poor Cassandra, whom\\ndeceitful Clytemnestra killed beside me.\\nAs I lay dying, struck through by the sword,\\nI tried to lift my arms up from the ground.\\nThat she-dog turned away. I went to Hades.\\nShe did not even shut my eyes or close\\nmy mouth. There is no more disgusting act\\nthan when a wife betrays a man like that.\\nThat woman formed a plot to murder me! \\nHer husband! When I got back home, I thought\\nI would be welcomed, at least by my slaves\\nand children. She has such an evil mind\\nthat she has poured down shame on her own head\\nand on all other women, even good ones.’\\nI cried out, ‘Curse her! Zeus has always brought\\ndisaster to the house of Atreus\\nthrough women. Many men were lost for Helen,\\nand Clytemnestra formed this plot against you\\nwhen you were far away.’\\nAt once he answered, \\n‘So you must never treat your wife too well.\\nDo not let her know everything you know.\\nTell her some things, hide others. But your wife\\nwill not kill you, Odysseus. The wise\\nPenelope is much too sensible\\nto do such things. Your bride was very young\\nwhen we went oﬀ to war. She had a baby\\nstill at her breast, who must be now a man.\\nHe will be glad when you come home and see him,\\nand he will throw his arms around his father. \\nThat is how things should go. My wife prevented\\nmy eager eyes from gazing at my son.\\nShe killed me first. I have a final piece\\nof sound advice for you—take heed of it.\\nWhen you arrive in your own land, do not\\nanchor your ship in full view; move in secret.\\nThere is no trusting women any longer.\\nBut have you any news about my son?\\nIs he alive? Is he in Orchomenus,\\nor sandy Pylos, or with Menelaus \\nin Sparta? Surely my fine son Orestes\\nis not yet dead.’\\nI answered, ‘Agamemnon,\\nwhy ask me this? I do not even know\\nwhether he is alive or dead. It is\\npointless to talk of hypotheticals.’\\nBoth of us wept profusely, deeply grieving\\nover the bitter words we spoke. Then came\\nthe spirits of Achilles and Patroclus\\nand of Antilochus and Ajax, who\\nwas handsomest and had the best physique, \\nof all the Greeks, next only to Achilles\\nthe sprinter. And Achilles recognized me\\nand spoke in tears.\\n‘My lord Odysseus,\\nyou fox! What will you think of next? How could you\\nbear to come down to Hades? Numb dead people\\nlive here, the shades of poor exhausted mortals.’\\nI said, ‘Achilles, greatest of Greek heroes,\\nI came down here to meet Tiresias,\\nin case he had advice for my return\\nto rocky Ithaca. I have not even \\nreached Greece, let alone my homeland. I have had\\nbad luck. But no one’s luck was ever better\\nthan yours, nor ever will be. In your life\\nwe Greeks respected you as we do gods,\\nand now that you are here, you have great power\\namong the dead. Achilles, you should not\\nbe bitter at your death.’\\nBut he replied,\\n‘Odysseus, you must not comfort me\\nfor death. I would prefer to be a workman,\\nhired by a poor man on a peasant farm, \\nthan rule as king of all the dead. But come,\\ntell me about my son. Do you have news?\\nDid he march oﬀ to war to be a leader?\\nAnd what about my father Peleus?\\nDoes he still have good standing among all\\nthe Myrmidons? Or do they treat him badly\\nin Phthia and Greece, since he is old\\nand frail? Now I have left the light of day,\\nand am not there to help, as on the plains\\nof Troy when I was killing the best Trojans, \\nto help the Greeks. If I could go for even\\na little while, with all that strength I had,\\nup to my father’s house, I would make those\\nwho hurt and disrespect him wish my hands\\nwere not invincible.’\\nI answered him,\\n‘I have no news to tell about your father,\\nbut I can tell you all about your son,\\ndear Neoptolemus. I brought him from\\nScyros by ship, with other well-armed Greeks.\\nWhen we were strategizing about Troy, \\nhe always spoke up first and to the purpose,\\nunmatched except by Nestor and myself.\\nAnd when we fought at Troy, he never paused\\nin the great throng of battle; he was always\\nfearlessly running forward, and he slaughtered\\nenormous numbers in the clash of war.\\nI cannot name all those he killed for us.\\nBut with his bronze he cut down Eurypylus,\\nthe son of Telephus, most handsome man\\nI ever saw, next only to great Memnon. \\nThe multitude of Cetians he brought\\nwere also killed, since Priam bribed his mother.\\nWhen we, the Argive leaders, were preparing\\nto climb inside the Wooden Horse, it was\\nmy task to open up and close the door.\\nThe other Greek commanders were in tears;\\ntheir legs were shaking. Not your handsome boy!\\nI never saw his face grow pale; he had\\nno tears to wipe away. Inside the horse,\\nhe begged me to allow him to jump out. \\nHe gripped his sword hilt and his heavy spear,\\nso desperate to go hurt the Trojans.\\nAt last, when we had sacked the lofty city\\nof Priam, he embarked weighed down with spoils.\\nNo sharp bronze spear had wounded him at all;\\nhe was unhurt by all the skirmishes\\nendured in war when Ares rages blind.’\\nAfter I told him this, Achilles’ ghost\\ntook great swift-footed strides across the fields\\nof asphodel, delighted to have heard \\nabout the glorious prowess of his son.\\nOther dead souls were gathering, all sad;\\neach told the story of his sorrow. Only\\nAjax kept back, enraged because I won\\nAchilles’ armor, when the case was judged\\nbeside the ships. The hero’s mother, Thetis,\\nand sons of Troy, and Pallas, gave the arms\\nto me. I wish I had not won this contest!\\nFor those arms Ajax lies beneath the earth,\\nwhose looks and deeds were best of all the Greeks \\nafter Achilles, son of Peleus.\\nI spoke to him to try to make it up.\\n‘Please, Ajax, son of mighty Telamon,\\ncan you not set aside your rage at me\\nabout those cursed arms? Not even now,\\nin death? The gods made them to ruin us.\\nYou were our tower; what a loss you were!\\nWe Greeks were struck by grief when you were gone;\\nwe mourned as long for you as for Achilles.\\nBlame nobody but Zeus. He ruined us, \\nin hatred for the army of the Greeks;\\nand that was why he brought this doom on you.\\nBut listen now, my lord. Subdue your anger.’\\nHe did not answer. He went oﬀ and followed\\nthe spirits of the dead to Erebus.\\nDespite his rage, we might have spoken longer\\nif I had not felt in my heart an urge\\nto see more spirits. I saw Minos there,\\nthe son of Zeus, who holds the golden scepter\\nand sits in judgment on the dead. They ask \\ntheir king to arbitrate disputes, inside\\nthe house of Hades, where the doors are always\\nwide open. I saw great Orion, chasing\\nacross the fields of asphodel the beasts\\nhe killed when living high in lonely mountains,\\nholding his indestructible bronze club.\\nAnd I saw Tityus, the son of Gaia,\\nstretched out nine miles. When Leto, Zeus’ lover,\\nwas traveling to Pytho, through the fields\\nof beautiful Panopeus, he raped her. \\nTwo vultures sit on either side of him,\\nripping his liver, plunging in his bowels;\\nhe fails to push them oﬀ. I saw the pain\\nof Tantalus, in water to his chin,\\nso parched, no way to drink. When that old man\\nbent down towards the water, it was gone;\\nsome god had dried it up, and at his feet\\ndark earth appeared. Tall leafy trees hung fruit\\nabove his head: sweet figs and pomegranates\\nand brightly shining apples and ripe olives. \\nBut when he grasped them with his hands, the wind\\nhurled them away towards the shadowy clouds.\\nAnd I saw Sisyphus in torment, pushing\\na giant rock with both hands, leaning on it\\nwith all his might to shove it up towards\\na hilltop; when he almost reached the peak,\\nits weight would swerve, and it would roll back down,\\nheedlessly. But he kept on straining, pushing,\\nhis body drenched in sweat, his head all dusty.\\nI saw a phantom of great Heracles. \\nThe man himself is with the deathless gods,\\nhappy and feasting, with fine-ankled Hebe,\\nthe child of mighty Zeus and golden Hera.\\nAround his ghost, the dead souls shrieked like birds,\\nall panic-struck. He walked like gloomy night,\\nholding his bow uncased and with an arrow\\nheld on the string. He glowered terribly,\\npoised for a shot. Around his chest was strapped\\na terrifying baldric made of gold,\\nfashioned with marvelous images of bears, \\nwild boars, and lions with fierce staring eyes,\\nand battles and the slaughtering of men.\\nI hope the craftsman who designed this scene\\nwill never make another work like this.\\nThis Heracles at once knew who I was,\\nand full of grief he cried,\\n‘Odysseus!\\nMaster of every circumstance, so you\\nare also tortured by the weight of fortune\\nas I was while I lived beneath the sun?\\nI was a son of Zeus, and yet my pain \\nwas infinite. I was enslaved to someone\\nfar less heroic than myself, who laid\\nharsh labors on me. Once he sent me here\\nto bring back Cerberus, since he could think\\nof no worse task for me. I brought the Dog\\nup out of Hades, with the help of Hermes,\\nand flashing-eyed Athena.’\\nHe went back\\nto Hades’ house. I stayed, in case more heroes\\nwho died in ancient times should come to me.\\nI would have seen the noble men I hoped for, \\nPirithous and Theseus, god-born.\\nBut masses of the dead came thronging round\\nwith eerie cries, and cold fear seized me, lest\\nthe dreadful Queen Persephone might send\\nthe monster’s head, the Gorgon, out of Hades.\\nSo then I hurried back and told my men\\nto climb on board the ship and loose the cables.\\nThey did so, and sat down along the benches.\\nThe current bore the ship down River Ocean,\\nfirst with the help of oars, and then fair wind.” \\nBOOK \\nDiﬃcult Choices\\n“Our ship sailed out beyond the stream of Ocean,\\nacross the waves of open sea, and came\\nto Aeaea, home of newborn Dawn, who dances\\nin meadows with the beams of Helius.\\nWe beached the ship upon the sandy shore,\\nand disembarked, and there we fell asleep\\nwhile waiting for bright morning. When Dawn came,\\nborn early, with her fingertips like petals,\\nI sent my men to Circe’s house, to bring\\nthe body of the dead Elpenor. Quickly \\nwe chopped the wood and at the farthest headland\\nwe held a funeral for him, and wept\\nprofusely, crying out in grief. We burned\\nhis body and his gear, and built a mound,\\nand dragged a pillar onto it, and fixed\\nhis oar on top—each ritual step in turn.\\nCirce, the well-groomed goddess, was aware\\nthat we were back from Hades, and she hurried\\nto meet us with her slaves. They carried bread\\nand meat and bright red wine. She stood among us, \\nand said,\\n‘This is amazing! You all went\\nalive to Hades—you will be twice-dead,\\nwhen other people only die one time!\\nEat now, and stay here drinking wine all day.\\nAt dawn, sail on. I will explain your route\\nin detail, so no evil thing can stitch\\na means to hurt you, on the land or sea.’\\nI am a stubborn man, but I agreed,\\nso there we sat and feasted on the meat\\nand strong sweet wine until the sun went down. \\nWhen darkness fell, the men slept by the ship.\\nThen Circe took my hand, and led me oﬀ\\napart from them, and questioned me in detail.\\nI told her everything. The lady Circe\\nreplied at last,\\n‘That quest is over now.\\nSo listen, I will give you good instructions;\\nanother god will make sure you remember.\\nFirst you will reach the Sirens, who bewitch\\nall passersby. If anyone goes near them\\nin ignorance, and listens to their voices, \\nthat man will never travel to his home,\\nand never make his wife and children happy\\nto have him back with them again. The Sirens\\nwho sit there in their meadow will seduce him\\nwith piercing songs. Around about them lie\\ngreat heaps of men, flesh rotting from their bones,\\ntheir skin all shriveled up. Use wax to plug\\nyour sailors’ ears as you row past, so they\\nare deaf to them. But if you wish to hear them,\\nyour men must fasten you to your ship’s mast \\nby hand and foot, straight upright, with tight ropes.\\nSo bound, you can enjoy the Sirens’ song.\\nBut if you beg your men to set you free,\\nthey have to tie you down with firmer knots.\\nI will not give you definite instructions\\nabout which route to take when you have sailed\\nbeyond the Sirens. Let your heart decide.\\nThere are two choices, and the first goes through\\nvast overhanging rocks, which Amphitrite\\nbatters aggressively with mighty waves. \\nThe blessed gods call these the Wandering Rocks.\\nNo birds can fly through safe, not even doves,\\nwho bring ambrosia to Zeus. One dove\\nis always lost in that sheer gulf of stone\\nand Zeus must send another to restore\\nthe number of the flock. No human ship\\nhas ever passed there. When one tries to enter,\\nthe waves and raging gusts of fire engulf\\nship timbers and the bodies of the men.\\nOnly the famous Ar go sailed through there \\nreturning from the visit with Aeetes.\\nThe current hurled the ship towards the rocks,\\nbut Hera, who loved Jason, led them safe.\\nTaking the second way, you meet two rocks:\\none reaches up to heaven with its peak,\\nsurrounded by blue fog that never clears.\\nNo light comes through there, even in the summer.\\nNo man could climb it or set foot upon it,\\neven if he had twenty hands and feet.\\nThe rock is sheer, as if it had been polished. \\nRight in the middle lies a murky cave\\nthat faces west, towards dark Erebus.\\nSteer your ship past it, great Odysseus.\\nThe hollow cave is so high up, no man\\ncould shoot it with an arrow. There lives Scylla,\\nhowling and barking horribly; her voice\\nis puppylike, but she is dangerous;\\neven a god would be afraid of her.\\nShe has twelve dangling legs and six long necks\\nwith a gruesome head on each, and in each face \\nthree rows of crowded teeth, pregnant with death.\\nHer belly slumps inside the hollow cave;\\nshe keeps her heads above the yawning chasm\\nand scopes around the rock, and hunts for fish.\\nShe catches dolphins, seals, and sometimes even\\nenormous whales—Queen Amphitrite, ruler\\nof roaring waters, nurtures many creatures.\\nNo sailors ever pass that way unharmed.\\nShe snatches one man with each mouth from oﬀ\\neach dark-prowed ship. The other rock is near, \\nenough to shoot an arrow right across.\\nThis second rock is lower down, and on it\\nthere grows a fig tree with thick leaves. Beneath,\\ndivine Charybdis sucks black water down.\\nThree times a day she spurts it up; three times\\nshe glugs it down. Avoid that place when she\\nis swallowing the water. No one could\\nsave you from death then, even great Poseidon.\\nRow fast, and steer your ship alongside Scylla,\\nsince it is better if you lose six men \\nthan all of them.’\\nI answered, ‘Goddess, please,\\ntell me the truth: is there no other way?\\nOr can I somehow circumvent Charybdis\\nand stop that Scylla when she tries to kill\\nmy men?’\\nThe goddess answered, ‘No, you fool!\\nYour mind is still obsessed with deeds of war.\\nBut now you must surrender to the gods.\\nShe is not mortal. She is deathless evil,\\nterrible, wild and cruel. You cannot fight her.\\nThe best solution and the only way \\nis flight. I am afraid if you take time\\nto arm beside the rock, she will attack\\nagain with all six heads and take six more.\\nSo row away with all your might, and call\\non Scylla’s mother, Cratais, Great Force,\\nwho bore her as a blight on humankind.\\nGo fast, before the goddess strikes again.\\nThen you will reach the island called Thrinacia,\\nwhere Helius keeps sheep and many cattle:\\nfifty per herd, with seven herds in all. \\nThey never reproduce or die, and those\\nwho tend them are the smooth-haired goddesses,\\nPhaethousa and Lampetia, the shining\\ndaughters of Helius by bright Neaira.\\nShe brought them up, then sent them oﬀ to live\\nthere in remote Thrinacia, to guard\\ntheir father’s sheep and cattle. If you can\\nremember home and leave the cows unharmed,\\nyou will at last arrive in Ithaca.\\nBut if you damage them, I must foretell \\ndisaster for your ship and for your crew.\\nEven if you survive, you will return\\nlate and humiliated, having caused\\nthe death of all your men.’\\nThe golden throne\\nof Dawn was riding up the sky as Circe\\nconcluded, and she strode across her island.\\nI went back to my ship and roused the men\\nto get on board and loose the sternward cables.\\nEmbarking, they sat down, each in his place,\\nand struck the gray saltwater with their oars. \\nBehind our dark-prowed ship, the dreadful goddess\\nCirce sent friendly wind to fill the sails.\\nWe worked eﬃciently to organize\\nthe rigging, and the breeze and pilot steered.\\nThen with an anxious heart I told the crew,\\n‘My friends, the revelations Circe shared\\nwith me should not be kept a secret, known\\nto me alone. I will share them with you,\\nand we can die in knowledge of the truth,\\nor else escape. She said we must avoid \\nthe voices of the otherworldly Sirens;\\nsteer past their flowering meadow. And she says\\nthat I alone should hear their singing. Bind me,\\nto keep me upright at the mast, wound round\\nwith rope. If I beseech you and command you\\nto set me free, you must increase my bonds\\nand chain me even tighter.’\\nSo I told them\\neach detail. Soon our well-built ship, blown fast\\nby fair winds, neared the island of the Sirens,\\nand suddenly, the wind died down. Calm came. \\nSome spirit lulled the waves to sleep. The men\\ngot up, pulled down the sails, and stowed them in\\nthe hollow hold. They sat at oar and made\\nthe water whiten, struck by polished wood.\\nI gripped a wheel of wax between my hands\\nand cut it small. Firm kneading and the sunlight\\nwarmed it, and then I rubbed it in the ears\\nof each man in his turn. They bound my hands\\nand feet, straight upright at the mast. They sat\\nand hit the sea with oars. We traveled fast, \\nand when we were in earshot of the Sirens,\\nthey knew our ship was near, and started singing.\\n‘Odysseus! Come here! You are well-known\\nfrom many stories! Glory of the Greeks!\\nNow stop your ship and listen to our voices.\\nAll those who pass this way hear honeyed song,\\npoured from our mouths. The music brings them joy,\\nand they go on their way with greater knowledge,\\nsince we know everything the Greeks and Trojans\\nsuﬀered in Troy, by gods’ will; and we know \\nwhatever happens anywhere on earth.’\\nTheir song was so melodious, I longed\\nto listen more. I told my men to free me.\\nI scowled at them, but they kept rowing on.\\nEurylochus and Perimedes stood\\nand tied me even tighter, with more knots.\\nBut when we were well past them and I could\\nno longer hear the singing of the Sirens,\\nI nodded to my men, and they removed\\nthe wax that I had used to plug their ears, \\nand untied me. When we had left that island,\\nI saw a mighty wave and smoke, and heard\\na roar. The men were terrified; their hands\\nlet fall the oars—they splashed down in the water.\\nThe ship stayed still, since no one now was pulling\\nthe slender blades. I strode along the deck\\npausing to cheer each man, then gave a speech\\nto rally all of them.\\n‘Dear friends! We are\\nexperienced in danger. This is not\\nworse than the time the Cyclops captured us, \\nand forced us to remain inside his cave.\\nWe got away that time, thanks to my skill\\nand brains and strategy. Remember that.\\nCome on then, all of you, and trust my words.\\nSit on your benches, strike the swelling deep\\nwith oars, since Zeus may grant us a way out\\nfrom this disaster also. Pilot, listen:\\nthese are your orders. As you hold the rudder,\\ndirect the ship away from that dark smoke\\nand rising wave, and head towards the rock; \\nif the ship veers the other way, you will\\nendanger us.’\\nThey promptly followed orders.\\nI did not mention Scylla, since she meant\\ninevitable death, and if they knew,\\nthe men would drop the oars and go and huddle\\ndown in the hold in fear. Then I ignored\\nCirce’s advice that I should not bear arms;\\nit was too hard for me. I dressed myself\\nin glorious armor; in my hands I took\\ntwo long spears, and I climbed up on the forecastle. \\nI thought that rocky Scylla would appear\\nfrom that direction, to destroy my men.\\nSo we rowed through the narrow strait in tears.\\nOn one side, Scylla; on the other, shining\\nCharybdis with a dreadful gurgling noise\\nsucked down the water. When she spewed it out,\\nshe seethed, all churning like a boiling cauldron\\non a huge fire. The froth flew high, to spatter\\nthe topmost rocks on either side. But when\\nshe swallowed back the sea, she seemed all stirred \\nfrom inside, and the rock around was roaring\\ndreadfully, and the dark-blue sand below\\nwas visible. The men were seized by fear.\\nBut while our frightened gaze was on Charybdis,\\nScylla snatched six men from the ship—my strongest,\\nbest fighters. Looking back from down below,\\nI saw their feet and hands up high, as they\\nwere carried oﬀ. In agony they cried\\nto me and called my name—their final words.\\nAs when a fisherman out on a cliﬀ \\ncasts his long rod and line set round with oxhorn\\nto trick the little fishes with his bait;\\nwhen one is caught, he flings it gasping back\\nonto the shore—so those men gasped as Scylla\\nlifted them up high to her rocky cave\\nand at the entrance ate them up—still screaming,\\nstill reaching out to me in their death throes.\\nThat was the most heartrending sight I saw\\nin all the time I suﬀered on the sea.\\nFree from the rocks of Scylla and Charybdis \\nwe quickly reached the island of the god,\\nHyperion’s son Helius, the Sun God.\\nThere were his cattle, with their fine broad faces,\\nand many flocks of well-fed sheep. While still\\nout on the sea in my black ship, I heard\\nthe lowing of the cattle in their pens,\\nand bleating of the sheep. I kept in mind\\nthe words of blind Tiresias the prophet\\nand Circe. Both had given strict instructions\\nthat we avoid the island of the Sun, \\nthe god of human joy. I told the men\\nwith heavy heart,\\n‘My friends, I know how much\\nyou have endured. But listen to me now.\\nTiresias and Circe both insisted\\nwe must avoid the island of the Sun,\\nthe joy of mortals. They said dreadful danger\\nlurks there for us. We have to steer our ship\\naround it.’\\nThey were quite downcast by this.\\nEurylochus said angrily to me,\\n‘You are unfair to us, Odysseus. \\nYou may be strong; you never seem to tire;\\nyou must be made of iron. But we men\\nhave had no rest or sleep; we are exhausted.\\nAnd you refuse to let us disembark\\nand cook our tasty dinner on this island.\\nYou order us to drift around all night\\nin our swift ship across the misty sea.\\nAt night, fierce storms rise up and wreck men’s ships,\\nand how can anyone escape disaster\\nif sudden gusts of wind from north or west \\nbring cruel blasts to break the ship, despite\\nthe wishes of the gods? Let us submit\\nto evening. Let us stay here, and cook food\\nbeside the ship. At dawn we can embark\\nand sail the open sea.’\\nThat was his speech.\\nThe other men agreed, and then I saw\\na spirit must be plotting our destruction.\\nMy words flew out.\\n‘Eurylochus! You force me\\nto yield, since I am one and you are many.\\nBut all of you, swear me a mighty oath: \\nif we find any herd of cows, or flock\\nof sheep, do not be fool enough to kill\\na single animal. Stay clear, and eat\\nthe food provided by immortal Circe.’\\nThey swore as I commanded. When they finished\\nmaking the oath, we set our well-built ship\\ninside the curving harbor, near freshwater.\\nThe men got out and skillfully cooked dinner.\\nWhen they were satisfied with food and drink,\\nthey wept, remembering their dear companions, \\nwhom Scylla captured from the ship and ate.\\nSweet sleep came down upon them as they cried.\\nWhen night was over, when the stars were gone,\\nZeus roused a blast of wind, an eerie storm.\\nHe covered earth and sea with fog, and darkness\\nfell down from heaven. When rose-fingered Dawn\\nappeared, we dragged the ship inside a cave,\\na place Nymphs danced in, and we moored it there.\\nI gave a speech to my assembled men.\\n‘My friends, we have supplies on board. Let us \\nnot touch the cattle, or we will regret it.\\nThose cows and fat sheep are the property\\nof Helius, the great Sun God, who sees\\nall things, and hears all things.’ I told them this.\\nReluctantly they yielded. But that month\\nthe South Wind blew and never stopped. No other\\nwas ever blowing, only South and East.\\nWhile the men still had food and wine, they kept\\nclear of the cows. They hoped to save their lives.\\nBut when our ship’s supplies ran out, the men \\nwere forced to hunt; they used their hooks to catch\\nboth fish and birds, whatever they could get,\\nsince hunger gnawed their bellies. I strode oﬀ\\nto pray, in case some god would show me how\\nto get back home. I left my men behind,\\nand crossed the island, washed my hands, in shelter\\nout of the wind, and prayed to all the gods.\\nThey poured sweet sleep upon my eyes.\\nMeanwhile,\\nEurylochus proposed a foolish plan.\\n‘Listen, my friends! You have already suﬀered \\ntoo much. All human deaths are hard to bear.\\nBut starving is most miserable of all.\\nSo let us poach the finest of these cattle,\\nand sacrifice them to the deathless gods.\\nIf we get home to Ithaca, at once\\nwe will construct a temple to the Sun God,\\nwith treasure in it. If he is so angry\\nabout these cows that he decides to wreck\\nour ship, and if the other gods agree—\\nI would prefer to drink the sea and die \\nat once, than perish slowly, shriveled up\\nhere on this desert island.’\\nAll the others\\nagreed with him. They went to poach the best\\nof Helius’ cattle, which were grazing\\nbeside the ship. The men surrounded them,\\nand called upon the gods. They had plucked leaves\\nfrom oak trees—on the ship there was no barley.\\nThey prayed, then killed them, skinned them, and cut oﬀ\\nthe thighs, and covered up the bones with fat,\\na double layer, with raw meat on top. \\nThey had no wine to pour libations over\\nthe burning oﬀering, but they made do\\nwith water, and they roasted all the innards.\\nAnd when the thighs were burned, the entrails sprinkled,\\nthey cut the other meat up into chunks\\nfor skewers.\\nSweet sleep melted from my eyes;\\nI rushed back to the ship beside the shore.\\nWhen I was close, the meaty smell of cooking\\nenfolded me. I groaned, and told the gods,\\n‘O Zeus, and all you deathless gods! You blinded \\nmy mind with that infernal sleep. My men\\ndid dreadful things while I was gone.’\\nMeanwhile,\\nLampetia in flowing skirts ran oﬀ\\nto tell the Sun God we had killed his cows.\\nEnraged, he called the other gods.\\n‘Great Zeus,\\nand all you other deathless gods, you must\\npunish Odysseus’ men. They killed\\nmy cattle! I delighted in those cows\\nall through each day, when I went up to heaven\\nand when I turned to earth. If they do not \\nrepay me, I will sink down into Hades\\nand bring my bright light only to the dead.’\\nZeus answered, ‘Helius! Please shine with us\\nand shine for mortals on life-giving earth.\\nI will immediately smite their ship\\nwith my bright thunderbolt, and smash it up\\nin fragments, all across the wine-dark sea.’\\nI heard this from the beautiful Calypso,\\nwho had been told by Hermes.\\nBack on shore\\nbeside my ship, I scolded each of them. \\nIt did no good; the cows were dead already.\\nThe gods sent signs—the hides began to twitch,\\nthe meat on skewers started mooing, raw\\nand cooked. There was the sound of cattle lowing.\\nFor six days my men banqueted on beef\\nfrom Helius. When Zeus, the son of Cronus,\\nled in the seventh day, the wind became\\nless stormy, and we quickly went on board.\\nWe set the mast up and unfurled the sails\\nand set out on the open sea.\\nWhen we \\nhad left that island, we could see no other,\\nonly the sky and sea. Zeus made a mass\\nof dark-blue storm cloud hang above our ship.\\nThe sea grew dark beneath it. For a moment\\nthe ship moved on, but then came Zephyr, shrieking,\\nnoisily rushing, with torrential tempest.\\nA mighty gust of wind broke oﬀ both forestays;\\nthe tacking was all scattered in the hold.\\nThe mast was broken backwards, and it struck\\nthe pilot in the stern; it smashed his skull. \\nHis bones were crushed, his skeleton was smashed.\\nHe fell down like a diver from the deck;\\nhis spirit left his body. At that instant,\\nZeus thundered and hurled bolts to strike the ship;\\nshaken, it filled with sulfur. All the men\\nfell overboard, and they were swept away\\nlike seagulls on the waves beside the ship.\\nThe gods prevented them from reaching home.\\nI paced on board until the current ripped\\nthe ship’s side from the keel. The waves bore oﬀ \\nthe husk, and snapped the mast. But thrown across it\\nthere was a backstay cable, oxhide leather.\\nWith this I lashed the keel and mast together,\\nand rode them, carried on by fearsome winds.\\nAt last the tempest ceased, the West Wind lulled.\\nI worried that the South Wind might compel me\\nto backtrack, to the terrible Charybdis.\\nAll night I was swept backwards and at sunrise\\nI came back to the dreadful rocks of Scylla\\nand of Charybdis, gulping salty water, \\nand overshadowed by the fig tree’s branches.\\nI jumped and clutched its trunk, batlike—unable\\nto plant my feet, or climb. The roots were down\\ntoo low; the tall long branches were too high.\\nSo I kept clinging on; I hoped Charybdis\\nwould belch my mast and keel back up. She did!\\nAs one who spends the whole day judging quarrels\\nbetween young men, at last goes home to eat—\\nat that same hour, the planks came bobbing up\\nout of Charybdis. I let go my hands \\nand feet and dropped myself way down to splash\\ninto the sea below, beside the timbers\\nof floating wood. I clambered onto them,\\nand used my hands to row myself away,\\nand Zeus ensured that Scylla did not see me,\\nor else I could not have survived. I drifted\\nfor nine days. On the evening of the tenth,\\nthe gods helped me to reach the island of\\nthe dreadful, beautiful, divine Calypso.\\nShe loved and cared for me. Why should I tell \\nthe story that I told you and your wife\\nyesterday in your house? It is annoying,\\nrepeating tales that have been told before.”\\nBOOK \\nTwo Tricksters\\nAfter he finished, all were silent, spellbound,\\nsitting inside the shadowy hall. At last,\\nAlcinous said,\\n“Now, Odysseus,\\nsince you have been my guest, beneath my roof,\\nyou need not wander anymore. You have\\nendured enough; you will get home again.\\nAnd all you regulars, my honored friends\\nwho always drink red wine here in my house\\nand listen to my singer: heed my words.\\nOur guest has clothes packed up inside a trunk, \\nand other gifts that we have given him.\\nEach of us now should add a mighty tripod\\nand cauldron. I will make the people pay\\na levy, so that none of us will suﬀer\\nfrom unrewarded generosity.”\\nThe king’s words pleased them all. They went back home\\nto rest. Then Dawn was born again; her fingers\\nbloomed, and they hurried back towards the ship\\nbringing heroic gifts of bronze. The king\\nembarked and stowed them underneath the beams, \\nto leave room for the crew when they were rowing.\\nThen all the men went back with him to eat.\\nThe holy king killed sacrificial meat—\\na cow to Zeus of dark clouds, son of Cronus,\\nwho rules the world. They burned the thighs and feasted\\nin happiness. The well-respected singer\\nDemodocus made music in their midst.\\nBut all the while Odysseus kept turning\\nhis head towards the shining sun, impatient\\nfor it to set. He longed to leave. As when \\na man is desperate for dinnertime\\nafter he spends the whole day with his oxen\\ndragging the jointed plow across the field,\\nand welcomes sunset, when he can go home\\nto eat; his legs are aching on the way—\\njust so Odysseus was glad of sunset.\\nAt once he told the seafaring Phaeacians,\\nespecially Alcinous,\\n“Great king,\\nand all of you, please send me safely home\\nwith oﬀerings, and thank you. I am grateful \\nto you for giving me my heart’s desire:\\na passage home, with gifts. I hope the gods\\nmaintain my luck. When I am home, I pray\\nto find my wife still faultless, and my loved ones\\nsafe. And may you Phaeacians live to bring\\njoy to your wives and children—every blessing.\\nI pray there is no trouble for your people.”\\nThey praised his words and said that they must help\\ntheir guest go home, since he had spoken well.\\nAlcinous addressed his right-hand man. \\n“Pontonous, now mix a bowl of wine;\\nserve drinks to everybody in the hall,\\nso we may pray to Zeus and help our guest\\nback to his homeland.”\\nSo the steward mixed\\na cheering bowl of wine and served them all\\nin turn. Still in their seats, they poured libations\\nto all the blessed gods that live in heaven.\\nGodlike Odysseus stood up and put\\na double-handled cup into the hands\\nof Arete. His words flew out to her. \\n“Bless you forever, queen, until old age\\nand death arrive for you, as for us all.\\nI will leave now. Be happy in your home\\nand children, and your people, and your king.”\\nWith that, the noble hero crossed the threshold.\\nAlcinous sent out his steward with him\\nto guide him to the swift ship on the shore.\\nArete sent some slave girls too. One brought\\na freshly laundered cloak and tunic; one\\ncarried the well-carved chest; the third brought bread \\nand red wine. When they reached the ship, the guides\\ntook all the food and drink and packed it neatly\\ninside the hold. They spread a sheet and blanket\\nout on the stern-deck of the hollow ship\\nso he could sleep there soundly. Climbing on,\\nhe lay there quietly. The rowers sat\\ndown on the benches calmly, and then loosed\\nthe cable from the mooring stone. They pulled,\\nleaning back hard; the oar blades splashed the water.\\nA sound sweet sleep fell on his eyes, like death; \\nhe did not stir. As four fine stallions\\nrush at the whip and race their chariot\\nacross the track, heads high, an easy canter—\\nso was the ship’s prow raised. The seething waves\\nof sounding purple sea rushed round the stern\\nas she sped straight ahead. The swiftest bird,\\na hawk, could never overtake; she sailed\\nso fast, and cleaved the waves. She bore a man\\nwhose mind was like the gods’, who had endured\\nmany heartbreaking losses, and the pain \\nof war and shipwreck. Now he slept in peace,\\nand he remembered nothing of his pain.\\nBut when the brightest star that carries news\\nabout the coming Dawn rose up the sky,\\nthe seaborne ship neared land. There is a harbor\\nof Phorcys, ancient sea god, in the district\\nof Ithaca. On either side of it\\nthere are sheer cliﬀs that jut across the bay;\\nthey shelter it and keep big waves outside\\nwhen storm winds blow. The ships remain in harbor \\nwithout a tether, once they cross its bounds.\\nAt the bay’s head there grows a long-leafed olive,\\nand near it is a beautiful dark cave,\\na holy place of sea-nymphs—Nereids.\\nInside are bowls and amphorae of stone,\\nand buzzing bees bring honey. There are looms,\\nalso of stone; the Nymphs weave purple cloth,\\nsea-purple—it is marvelous to see.\\nWater is always flowing through. There are\\ntwo entrances. The north one is for humans; \\nthe south is sacred. People cannot enter\\nthat way—it is the path of the immortals.\\nThey rowed inside the bay; they knew the place\\nof old. Their arms were pulling at top speed;\\nthe ship was traveling so fast that when\\nshe reached dry land, she beached for half her length.\\nThey disembarked, and lifted from the ship\\nOdysseus, wrapped up in sheets and blankets.\\nThey set him on the sand, still fast asleep.\\nThey unpacked all the presents he was given \\nby the Phaeacian lords to take back home,\\nthanks to Athena’s care. They heaped the things\\nbeside the olive tree, so no one passing\\nwould do them any damage while their owner\\nwas sleeping. Then they rowed away, back home.\\nPoseidon, Lord of Earthquakes, still remembered\\nhis hatred of Odysseus; he asked\\nZeus what he meant to do.\\n“O Father Zeus!\\nI will lose all my standing with the gods,\\nsince mortals fail to honor me, though these \\nPhaeacians are my very own descendants!\\nI always said Odysseus would reach\\nhome in the end. I did not take away\\nthat privilege from him, no, not at all,\\nsince you had promised it with your own nod.\\nTheir swift ship carried him across the ocean,\\nand they have set him down in Ithaca\\nwith a magnificent array of gifts:\\nbronze, heaps of gold and fine-spun clothes, far more\\nspoils than he ever would have won at Troy \\nif he had got out safely.”\\nStorm God Zeus\\nexclaimed, “Earth-Shaker! How absurd! The gods\\ndo not dishonor you; it would be hard\\nto disrespect an elder so high-ranking.\\nIf willful humans fail to show respect,\\nthen punish them; you always have that power.\\nDo as you wish!”\\nPoseidon answered, “Lord\\nof Dark Clouds, I have always wanted to.\\nI held back out of deference to you.\\nBut now, when that fine ship of those Phaeacians \\ncomes back from helping him across, I want\\nto smash it in the sea, and overwhelm\\ntheir city with a mountain, to prevent them\\nfrom ever guiding travelers again.”\\nThe Cloud Lord Zeus said, “Brother, I suggest\\nthat while the people in the city watch,\\nyou turn the ship arriving into stone,\\nstill looking like a ship. They will all\\nbe shocked. Then you can surround their town\\nwith a huge mountain.”\\nHearing this, Poseidon \\nwent to Phaeacian Scheria, and waited.\\nAs the ship sped towards the shore, the god\\nmoved near it, turned it all to stone, and slapped\\nhis palm to make it rooted to the seabed.\\nHe vanished, and the people of Phaeacia,\\nknown for their oars and famous ships, began\\nto ask each other,\\n“What? Who fixed that ship\\nfirm in the sea as she was rushing home?\\nWe saw it all!” They could not understand it.\\nAlcinous addressed the crowd and spoke. \\n“So it is true! My father long ago\\nsaid that Poseidon hates us for our habit\\nof helping travelers get home again;\\nwe got away with it, but he foretold\\nthat one day great Poseidon would destroy\\na ship on her return from such a journey;\\nthe god would hide our city with a mountain.\\nAnd now the old man’s words are coming true.\\nSo all of you must listen to me now.\\nStop helping visitors to travel onward. \\nWe have to sacrifice twelve bulls, handpicked\\nfor Lord Poseidon, so he may show mercy,\\nand not enfold our city in a mountain.”\\nAt this, they were afraid, and they prepared\\nthe bulls, and all the leaders of Phaeacia\\nprayed to Poseidon, standing round the altar.\\nMeanwhile Odysseus, who had been sleeping\\nin his own native land of Ithaca\\nwoke up, but did not recognize the place\\nfrom which he had been absent for so long. \\nPallas Athena cast a mist upon it,\\nso she could tell him how things stood, and make him\\nunrecognizable to his own wife\\nand family and neighbors, till he paid\\nthe suitors back for how they misbehaved.\\nThe friendly harbors and the winding paths\\nand leafy trees were all quite unfamiliar\\nto their own king. He leapt up to his feet\\nand looking at his native land, he groaned\\nand smacked his thighs, and sobbed,\\n“Where am I now? \\nAre those who live here violent and cruel?\\nOr are they kind to strangers, folks who fear\\nthe gods? Where can I carry all my treasure?\\nAnd where can I go wandering? If only\\nI had remained there in Phaeacia, till\\nI went on to some other mighty king\\nwho might have been my friend and helped me home.\\nWhere can I leave my things? Not here for sure;\\nthey will be stolen. Those Phaeacian lords\\nwere not so trustworthy! They promised me \\nthat they would bring me home to Ithaca.\\nThey broke their word and brought me somewhere else.\\nMay Zeus who helps the needy make them pay!\\nZeus watches everyone, and punishes\\nthe sinner. Let me count my treasure now—\\nthey may have stolen some when they sailed oﬀ.”\\nHe counted all the tripods, cauldrons, gold\\nand cloth, but none was missing. Then he paced\\nbeside the loud resounding sea, hunched up\\nwith homesickness and sobbing in his grief. \\nAthena came towards him; she looked like\\na shepherd, young and soft-skinned as a prince,\\nwearing a folded mantle of fine cloth\\nacross her shoulders; on her tender feet\\nwere sandals, and she held a javelin.\\nOdysseus was overjoyed to see her.\\nHe cried,\\n“Oh, friend! You are the very first\\nperson that I have met here. Greetings! Please,\\nbe kind, protect my treasure and myself.\\nI pray to you and supplicate, as if \\nyou were a god. I touch your knees; please help me!\\nAnd tell me, please, what is this place? An island?\\nOr is it a peninsula that slopes\\ntowards the sea from fertile mainland fields?\\nWho lives here?”\\nAnd with twinkling eyes the goddess\\nsaid, “Stranger, you must be a foreigner\\nfrom distant parts, or foolish, since you ask\\nabout this famous country. Many people\\nknow it, from those who live towards the east\\nunder the rising sun, to those out west \\nin lands of gloomy dusk. This is rough country,\\nnot fit for grazing horses, and not spacious,\\nbut not infertile; corn and wine abound here.\\nThe land is always wet with rain and dew.\\nThere are fine water holes, and it is good\\nfor raising goats and cattle, and the trees\\nare varied. Foreigner, I think the name\\nof Ithaca is even known in Troy,\\na land they say is far away from Greece.”\\nOdysseus, who had endured so much, \\nso long, was overjoyed, to hear from her\\nthat he was in his own dear native land.\\nHis words took wings and flew, but he did not\\ntell her the truth; he bit his story back.\\nHis mind was always full of clever schemes.\\n“Yes, I have heard of Ithaca, although\\nI come from distant Crete. Now I am here\\nwith all this wealth; I left an equal share\\nof riches for my children back at home.\\nI am in exile. On the fields of Crete \\nI killed Orsilochus, the speedy sprinter,\\nthe son of Idomeneus, the king.\\nI had refused to serve or help his father\\nat Troy; I led my own men. So the son\\nwanted to steal the Trojan spoils for which\\nI worked so hard, in war and long sea journeys.\\nI hid beside the road with one companion,\\nand as he came back from the countryside,\\nI ambushed him, and hit him with my spear.\\nThe sky was dark that night, and no one saw me \\nkill him with my sharp sword of bronze. And after\\nI murdered him, I quickly rowed away\\nto visit the Phoenicians, and I gave them\\na share of loot, which made them very glad.\\nI told them they should transport me to Pylos,\\nor famous Elis, ruled by the Epeians.\\nBut storm winds drove them oﬀ away from there\\nagainst their will: they did not mean to trick me.\\nSo swept oﬀ course, we came here in the night.\\nWe rowed at top speed into harbor, hungry, \\nbut none of us took any thought of dinner.\\nWe disembarked and all lay down right there.\\nSweet sleep enfolded me. I was exhausted.\\nThey took my treasure from the ship and set it\\nbeside me as I slept upon the sand.\\nAnd then they sailed away to well-built Sidon,\\nand I was left here grieving.”\\nAt his words,\\nAthena smiled into his eyes. She took\\nhis hand, and changed her body to a woman’s:\\nbeautiful, tall, and skilled in all the arts. \\nHer words were light as feathers.\\n“To outwit you\\nin all your tricks, a person or a god\\nwould need to be an expert at deceit.\\nYou clever rascal! So duplicitous,\\nso talented at lying! You love fiction\\nand tricks so deeply, you refuse to stop\\neven in your own land. Yes, both of us\\nare smart. No man can plan and talk like you,\\nand I am known among the gods for insight\\nand craftiness. You failed to recognize me: \\nI am Athena, child of Zeus. I always\\nstand near you and take care of you, in all\\nyour hardships. I made sure that you were welcomed\\nby the Phaeacians. I have come here now\\nto weave a plan with you and hide the treasure\\nwhich, thanks to me, they gave you to take home.\\nI will reveal the challenges you face\\nat home. This is your fate, and you must bear it\\nbravely, not telling any man or woman\\nthat you have finished wandering and come back. \\nSuﬀer in silence, bear their brutal treatment.”\\nOdysseus, still wary, answered, “Goddess,\\neven the smartest man may find it hard\\nto recognize you. You disguise yourself\\nso many ways. I do know that you helped me\\nduring the Trojan War, so long ago.\\nBut when we Greeks had sacked the town of Priam,\\nand we embarked, and gods dispersed our fleet,\\nI did not see you there on board my ship,\\ndaughter of Zeus. You gave me no protection. \\nLost and confused, I waited for the gods\\nto free me from my pain. I met you later,\\nin rich Phaeacia, and you spoke to me\\ncomforting words, and led me to the city.\\nPlease, by your father Zeus! I cannot think\\nthat this is Ithaca. I must be elsewhere.\\nYou want to fool me and make fun of me.\\nTell me the truth! Is this my own dear home?”\\nWith glowing eyes she said, “You always have\\nsuch keen intelligence, and that is why \\nI cannot leave you when you need my help.\\nYou have such intuition and such focus.\\nAn ordinary man would rush straight home\\nto see his wife and children when he reached\\nhis country, after such a journey. You\\ndecided not to even ask about them,\\nuntil you test your wife. She sits at home,\\npassing each night in misery, each day\\nin tears. For my part, I have never doubted.\\nI felt sure in my heart you would get home, \\nafter the loss of all your men. But I\\ndid not want conflict with my father’s brother,\\nPoseidon, who resented you because\\nyou blinded his beloved son. Now I\\nwill show you Ithaca, so you believe.\\nThis is the bay of Phorcys, ancient sea god,\\nand at the head there is an olive tree\\nwith long leaves, and nearby, the shady cave\\nsacred to nymphs called Nereids, to whom\\nyou sacrificed so many hundred cattle. \\nAnd here is Neriton, the wooded mountain.”\\nWith that, the goddess made the mist disperse.\\nThe land was visible. Odysseus,\\nafter so long a wait and so much pain,\\nwas filled with happiness at last. In joy\\nhe kissed the fertile earth of his own country,\\nthen lifted high his arms and prayed,\\n“O Nymphs!\\nI never thought I would come back to you,\\ndaughters of Zeus. Accept my loving prayers,\\nand I will give you gifts, as in the past, \\nif my commander, child of Zeus, is kind\\nand lets me live and raise my son.”\\nAthena\\nlooked straight into his eyes and said, “Be brave.\\nYou need not worry. Let us hurry now\\nto hide the treasure safely in the cave.\\nAnd then we must make plans.”\\nThe goddess went\\ndown in the murky cave, and looked around\\nfor hiding spots. Odysseus brought in\\nthe presents the Phaeacians gave him—gold,\\nand tireless bronze and finely woven cloth. \\nAthena set them all inside, and fixed\\nthe door-stone up, and then the two sat down\\nagainst the sacred olive and they planned\\nhow to destroy the suitors. Eyes aglow,\\nAthena said,\\n“Great king, Laertes’ son,\\nmaster of plots and plans, Odysseus,\\nthink how to strike the suitors. For three years\\nthey have been lording in your house and courting\\nyour godlike wife with gifts. She always longs\\nfor your return, and grieves. She leads them on \\nwith promises and messages to each,\\nbut her mind moves elsewhere.”\\nOdysseus\\ncried, “Oh! I would have died like Agamemnon\\nin my own house, if you had not explained\\nexactly how things stand. So, goddess, now\\nweave me a strategy to pay them back.\\nStand by me, give me courage and the drive\\nto fight as when I broke the shining crown\\nof Troy. If you will join me with that zeal\\nand help me, goddess-queen, I could do battle \\nagainst three hundred men at once.”\\nAthena\\nlooked straight at him, clear-eyed. She said, “I will\\nbe with you, truly. Know I stand beside you\\nas we begin our work. I do believe\\nthe suitors who devour your livelihood\\nwill spatter your broad floors with blood and brains.\\nBut now I will disguise you, so no human\\ncan recognize you. I will shrivel up\\nthe fine skin of your supple arms and legs,\\nruin your hair, and dress you up in rags, \\nso everyone will shudder, seeing you.\\nAnd I will cloud your eyes, to make you seem\\nugly to all the suitors, and your wife\\nand to the son you left at home. Now visit\\nthe swineherd who, though he is just a slave,\\nadores your son and wise Penelope\\nand is your friend. Go look for him among\\nthe sows who root beside the Corax rock\\nand near the spring of Arethusa, drinking\\nblack water, eating good nutritious acorns, \\nwhich fatten pigs. Stay there and sit with him,\\nand ask him everything. And I will go\\nto Sparta, where the girls are beautiful,\\nto fetch Telemachus, the boy you love.\\nHe went to Menelaus, to find out\\nif you are still alive.”\\nHe asked her sharply,\\n“But why did you not tell him? You must know\\neverything. Did you want him suﬀering\\nlike me, lost out at sea, while others eat\\nhis whole inheritance?”\\nWith shining eyes \\nAthena answered, “Come now, do not worry\\nabout the boy. I guided him myself\\nso that he might win glory by his journey.\\nHe is not suﬀering. He is away,\\nsitting and banqueting with Menelaus.\\nThe suitors do indeed desire to kill him,\\nand wait in ambush for him in their ship.\\nBut they will not succeed, I think. The earth\\nwill cover one or more of those who eat\\nyour property.”\\nThen with her wand Athena \\ntapped him; his handsome body withered up;\\nhis limbs became arthritic. She bleached out\\nhis hair, and made his skin look old and wrinkled,\\nand dimmed his fine bright eyes. She turned his clothes\\ninto a tattered cloak and ragged tunic,\\ndirty with soot. She wrapped around his shoulders\\na massive leather deerskin, and she gave him\\na threadbare tote bag and a walking stick.\\nTheir plans were set; they parted. She went oﬀ\\nto Sparta, to go fetch Telemachus. \\nBOOK \\nA Loyal Slave\\nLeaving the bay, he hiked the rugged path\\nthrough woodland and across the cliﬀs; Athena\\nhad shown him where to go to find the swineherd.\\nOf all those in Odysseus’ household,\\nthis noble slave cared most about preserving\\nthe master’s property. Odysseus\\nfound him as he was sitting out on his porch.\\nHis yard was high and visible for miles,\\nof fieldstones topped with twigs of thorny pear.\\nHe built it in the absence of his master, \\nwith no help from Laertes or the mistress.\\nAround the yard, he set a ring of stakes,\\nof wood with bark stripped oﬀ. Inside the yard,\\nhe made twelve sties all next to one another,\\nfor breeding sows, with fifty in each one.\\nThe boars slept outside; there were fewer of them,\\nbecause the suitors kept on eating them.\\nThe swineherd let them have the fattest boars;\\njust three hundred and sixty still remained.\\nTheir captain kept four fierce half-wild dogs \\nto guard the gate. Now he was cutting oxhide\\nto make himself some sandals. Of his men,\\nthree herded up the pigs, and ran around\\nin all directions; he had sent the fourth\\nto town to take a pig to those proud suitors.\\nHe had no choice; he had to satisfy\\ntheir cravings for fresh meat.\\nThen suddenly\\nthe guard dogs saw Odysseus, and rushed\\ntowards him with loud barks. He kept his head,\\nand sank down to the ground and dropped his stick. \\nThey would have hurt him terribly, and shamed him\\non his own property—but acting fast\\nthe swineherd dropped his leatherwork and rushed\\nto chase the dogs away. He yelled at them\\nand pelted them with stones to make them scatter.\\nAnd then he told his master,\\n“My dogs almost\\nripped you apart, old man! You would have brought me\\nshame, when the gods are hurting me already.\\nI am in mourning for an absent master,\\nraising his pigs for other men to eat. \\nMy lord is lost and maybe even hungry,\\nin lands where the people speak in foreign tongues—\\nif he is even still alive, still seeing\\nthe sunlight. Well now, follow me, old man,\\nfill up on food and wine, then tell me where\\nyou come from, and the troubles you have borne.”\\nThe noble swineherd heaped up cushy brushwood,\\nand spread a furry goatskin over it—his own\\nbed-blanket, thick and warm. Odysseus\\nsat down and was delighted at this welcome. \\nHe said,\\n“May Zeus and all the deathless gods\\nreward you with your heart’s desire, because\\nyou welcomed me so willingly.”\\nAnd you,\\nEumaeus, answered, “One must honor guests\\nand foreigners and strangers, even those\\nmuch poorer than oneself. Zeus watches over\\nbeggars and guests and strangers. What I have\\nto give is small, but I will give it gladly.\\nLife is like this for slaves: we live in fear,\\nwhen younger men have power over us. \\nMy real lord is kept from home by gods.\\nHe would have taken care of me, and given\\nwhat kindly owners give to loyal slaves:\\na house with land, and wife whom many men\\nwould want—as recompense for years of labor\\nwhich gods have blessed and made to prosper. Master\\nwould have been good to me, if he had stayed\\nhere till old age. He must be dead by now.\\nDamn Helen and her family! So many\\nhave died for her sake. Master went to Troy, \\nto win back Agamemnon’s honor, fighting\\nthe Trojans.”\\nThen he belted up his tunic\\nand hurried to the pen, and chose two piglets.\\nInside he butchered them, singed oﬀ the bristles,\\nchopped up the meat and roasted it on skewers.\\nHe set it, piping hot, before his guest,\\nsprinkling barley on the top. He mixed\\nwine in an ivy bowl, as sweet as honey,\\nand then sat down across from him, and urged,\\n“Now, guest, eat up! This is a poor slave’s meal: \\na suckling pig. The suitors eat the hogs.\\nTheir hearts have no compassion! They ignore\\nthe gods, who watch and hate such crimes and bless\\ngood deeds and justice. Even cutthroat pirates,\\nwho go to plunder other people’s lands,\\nseizing the spoils that Zeus has granted them,\\nand sail home in a ship filled full of treasure—\\neven they feel the watchful eyes of gods.\\nThese suitors must have heard some god’s voice saying,\\n‘Odysseus has died.’ So they refuse \\nto go back to their own homes or to arrange\\nsuitable marriages. Instead they sit,\\nwasting his wealth on feasts. Each night and day\\nthey butcher sheep, not one but dozens of them,\\nand pour out yet more wine for reckless drinking.\\nThose selfish oafs! My lord was very rich;\\nno others on the mainland or back here\\nin Ithaca, nor twenty all combined,\\npossessed as much. I will list all of it.\\nTwelve herds of cattle on the mainland, twelve \\nof sheep, and twelve of pigs, and twelve of goats.\\nHe had to hire more laborers to help us.\\nAnd out here on the far end of the island,\\neleven herds of goats are grazing, watched\\nby good men. Every day, a herdsman takes\\nwhichever goat seems fattest and most healthy\\nup to the palace. I, who watch these pigs,\\nmust choose the best for them.”\\nOdysseus\\ngratefully wolfed the meat and drank the wine\\nin silence. He was hatching plots to ruin \\nthe suitors. After he had had enough\\nto eat, he took the wine-cup he had drunk from,\\nfilled it again and gave it to Eumaeus,\\nwho took it gladly. Then Odysseus\\nsaid,\\n“Friend, who bought you? This rich, noble man\\nthat you describe—who is he? You say he\\ndied in the war for Agamemnon’s honor.\\nPerhaps I know him, since he must be famous.\\nZeus and the other gods will be aware\\nif I have seen him and can bring you news. \\nHe traveled widely.”\\nBut the swineherd said,\\n“His wife and son will not trust travelers\\nwho claim to bring them news. Tramps always lie\\nto get a meal—they have no cause to tell\\nthe truth. All those who pass through Ithaca\\ngo to my mistress spinning foolish tales.\\nShe welcomes them and questions them, while tears\\nstream from her eyes, and rightly so: a wife\\nshould mourn for her dead husband. Sir, you also\\nwould weave tall tales if you got clothes for it. \\nBut in reality, my master’s skin\\nhas been ripped oﬀ his bones by birds of prey\\nand dogs; his life is gone. Or he has been\\neaten at sea by fish; his bones are lying\\nupon the beach, heaped high with sand. His death\\nis ruin for us all, especially me,\\nsince I will never have so kind a master,\\nhowever far I go, not even if\\nI go back to the home of my own parents\\nwho gave me birth and brought me up. I wish \\nthat I could see them, in my native land.\\nBut I grieve less for my own family\\nthan for Odysseus. I miss him so.\\nI hesitate to call him by his name,\\nstranger: I would prefer to call him ‘brother,’\\neven when he is far away, because\\nhe loved and cared for me with so much kindness.”\\nOdysseus was self-restrained. He said,\\n“My friend, you are so adamant, insisting\\nthat he will not come back. You have no faith. \\nBut this is no tall tale: I swear to you\\nOdysseus is on his way. And when\\nhe is in his own house, then I will claim\\nmy prize as messenger—some better clothes.\\nTill then, I will take nothing, though I need them.\\nI hate like Hades’ gates the man who caves\\nto poverty, and starts to lie. I swear\\nby Zeus, and by the welcome that you gave me,\\nand by the hearth of great Odysseus,\\nwhere I am going: all this will turn out \\nas I say now. Odysseus will come,\\nwithin this very cycle of the moon:\\nbetween the waning and the waxing time,\\nhe will come home, and pay back all those here\\nwho disrespect his wife and noble son.”\\nYou answered him, swineherd Eumaeus, “Sir,\\nI will not give you this reward, since he\\nwill not come home. Relax and drink. Let us\\nthink about other things. Do not remind me.\\nMy heart is troubled when a person mentions \\nmy faithful master. Never mind your oath.\\nI hope he comes, as do Penelope\\nand old Laertes and Telemachus.\\nMay it come true. But I cannot forget\\nmy grief for that poor boy, my master’s son.\\nThanks to the gods, he grew up like a tree,\\nhandsome and strong, as if to match his father\\nwhen he becomes a man. But somebody\\nor some god ruined his good sense. He went\\nto Pylos, seeking news about his father. \\nThe suitors lie in wait for when he comes\\nback home, and soon Arcesius’ line\\nwill be wiped out on Ithaca. No more.\\nThey may catch him, or he may get away,\\nkept safe by Zeus. Now tell me, sir, the truth\\nabout your own adventures. Where are you from?\\nWhere do your parents live? Where is your town?\\nOn what boat did you sail here? How did sailors\\nbring you to Ithaca? And who were they?\\nI know you did not reach this land by foot.” \\nOdysseus said cunningly, “I will\\ntell you the truth, the whole truth. How I wish\\nwe two could sit at ease here in this cottage,\\nand we had food and sweet strong wine to last\\nas long as we desired, while all the work\\nwas done by others! Even if I talked\\na whole year, I would not complete the story\\nof everything the gods have made me suﬀer.\\nProudly I say, I come from spacious Crete,\\nthe son of wealthy Castor Hylacides, \\nwhose sons by his main wife were numerous,\\nraised in his house. My mother was a slave,\\nbought as a concubine, and yet my father\\nrespected me like all his other sons.\\nThe Cretan people held him in high honor\\nas if he were a god, since he was rich\\nand had such noble sons. But fate arrived\\nto take him down to Hades. Then my brothers\\nselfishly seized his property, and gave\\nonly a tiny part to me, with barely \\na place to live. But I was not a weakling,\\nor cowardly in fighting. My great skill\\nand talent helped me win a wife who had\\na decent dowry—all lost now. But you\\ncan see in stubble how the grain once grew,\\nthough I am crushed by grief. I have the gift\\nof courage from Athena and from Ares.\\nWhenever I chose warriors to ambush\\nour enemies, I never thought of death.\\nI leapt out far in front, and ran to catch them \\nand spear them. That was how I was in war.\\nI did not like farmwork or housekeeping,\\nor raising children. I liked sailing better,\\nand war with spears and arrows, deadly weapons.\\nOthers may shudder at such things, but gods\\nmade my heart love them. People’s preferences\\nare diﬀerent. Before the Greeks went oﬀ\\nto march on Troy, I led my troops and fleet\\non nine forays, with great success. I had\\nmy pick of all the spoils, and got much more \\nwhen we shared out the winnings. Soon my house\\ngrew rich; I was a fine, important man\\namong the Cretans. But far-seeing Zeus\\narranged that expedition of disaster,\\nwhich made so many men collapse and fall.\\nThe people wanted me to sail to Troy\\nwith Idomeneus. We had no choice;\\ntheir will was strong, constraining us. We Greeks\\nfought for nine years, and in the tenth we sacked\\nthe town of Priam, and sailed home. Some god \\nscattered the Greeks, and I was cursed by Zeus.\\nI stayed for just one month at home, enjoying\\nmy children and my wife and my possessions.\\nSome impulse made me want to sail to Egypt,\\nwith nine ships and a godlike crew. I rushed\\nto get the fleet prepared and gather up\\nthe men. I paid for many animals,\\nto kill as sacrifices for the gods\\nand for the men to cook and eat. We feasted\\nsix days, then on the seventh we embarked \\nand sailed from Crete. A fair north wind was blowing\\nso we could drift on easily, like floating\\ndownstream. No one got sick, and all our ships\\ncame through undamaged. We sat tight, and let\\nthe wind and pilot guide us over seas.\\nIn five days we had reached the river valley\\nof Egypt; my fleet docked inside the Nile.\\nI told the loyal men to wait and guard\\nthe ships while I sent scouts to check around\\nfrom points of higher ground. But they indulged \\ntheir own aggressive impulses, and started\\nwillfully doing damage to the fields\\nof Egypt and enslaved the little children\\nand women, and they killed the men. The news\\nsoon reached the city; people heard the screaming,\\nand right away at dawn, they all arrived.\\nThe plain was filled with warriors on foot,\\nand chariots and gleaming bronze, and Zeus,\\nthe Lord of Lightning, caused my men to panic.\\nThey dared not keep on fighting; danger lurked \\non every side. Then many of my men\\nwere killed with sharp bronze spears; the rest were taken\\nas slaves to work for them. I wish I too\\nhad died in Egypt! But more pain remained.\\nZeus put another plan into my mind.\\nI took my helmet oﬀ my head and dropped\\nmy shield and sword, and unarmed I approached\\nthe king. Beside his chariot I grasped\\nhis knees and kissed them. He was merciful;\\nhe kept me safe, and took me home with him, \\nriding his chariot. My eyes were wet.\\nMany Egyptians were enraged with me,\\nand tried to kill me with their spears; the king\\nprotected me—he feared the wrath of Zeus,\\nthe god of strangers, who hates wickedness.\\nI stayed there seven years and gained great wealth;\\nall the Egyptian people gave me gifts.\\nBut in the eighth, an avaricious man\\ncame from Phoenicia. He was good at lying,\\nskilled and well practiced at exploiting people. \\nHe tricked me into going oﬀ with him\\nback to Phoenicia, where he lived. I stayed\\na year, but when the hours and days and months\\nhad rolled around again, he made me sail\\nover the seas to Libya, pretending\\nthat I would go with him to do some trading.\\nHis true plan was to sell me for a profit.\\nI had suspicions, but I climbed on board.\\nThe ship sailed out with fair north wind behind her\\nfrom Crete out into open sea. But Zeus \\nplanned to destroy the crew. On leaving Crete,\\nno other land was visible, but only\\nthe sea and sky. Zeus set a dark-blue cloud\\nacross our ship that cast a shadow over\\nthe sea. He thundered and then hurled a bolt\\nof lightning at the ship. The impact whirled\\nthe ship right round and filled her up with sulfur.\\nThe men fell overboard and all were swept\\naway by waves, like cormorants beside\\nthe dark ship, and gods took away their chance \\nof getting home. But in my desperation\\nZeus rescued me. He put the sturdy mast\\ninto my hands. I clung to it and drifted,\\npropelled by storm winds for nine days. And on\\nthe tenth black night, the rolling waters swept me\\ntowards Thesprotia. There the king, named Pheidon,\\nhelped me without expecting recompense\\nbecause his son had found me all worn out,\\nchilled by the morning air. He took my hand,\\nraised me and led me to his father’s house, \\nand dressed me. That was where I heard about\\nOdysseus—the king said he had been\\na guest there on his journey home. The king\\nshowed me the treasure that Odysseus\\nhad gathered: gold and bronze and hard-worked iron.\\nThe royal stores contained enough to feed\\nhis family for ten more generations.\\nOdysseus, the king said, had gone oﬀ\\nto Dodona, to ask the holy oak\\nwhat Zeus intended. He had been too long \\naway from fertile Ithaca. He wondered\\nhow best to get back home—in some disguise\\nor openly. The king then swore to me,\\npouring libations, that he had a boat\\nprepared and crew picked out, to take him back\\nto his dear homeland. But he sent me first;\\nit happened some Thesprotians were already\\nsailing towards grain-rich Dulichium.\\nThe king told them to treat me well and take me\\nto King Acastus. But their hearts preferred \\nto bring me once again to misery.\\nAfter the ship was out upon the sea,\\nthey plotted to enslave me. They stripped oﬀ\\nmy cloak and tunic, and tossed me these rags\\nin which you see me now. And when night fell\\nthey came to Ithaca’s bright fields, and tied me\\ntightly with rope and left me on the ship,\\nand quickly went ashore to get some dinner.\\nThe gods themselves unloosed my bonds; they slipped\\neasily oﬀ. I pulled my ragged clothes \\nover my head, slid down the smooth ship’s plank\\nand plunged chest-forward in the sea. I swam\\nfast with both arms, and quickly got away.\\nI came ashore beside a flowering thicket\\nand huddled there in fear. They stomped around,\\nshouting, but in a while they gave up looking,\\nand got back on the ship. The gods themselves\\nhid me with ease, and brought me to this cottage—\\na wise man’s home—because it is my fate\\nto stay alive.”\\nEumaeus, you replied, \\n“Poor guest! Your tale of woe is very moving,\\nbut pointless; I will not believe a word\\nabout Odysseus. Why did you stoop\\nto tell those silly lies? I know about\\nmy master’s homecoming. The gods detest him;\\nthey loathe him, since they did not let him die\\nat Troy or in his friends’ arms, when the war\\nwas winding up, so that the Greeks could build\\na mound to glorify him and his son\\nin times to come. The robber-winds have snatched him. \\nHe has no glory now. I am a loner;\\nI live here with the pigs, and do not go\\nto town, except when wise Penelope\\ncalls me to share some news. The people cluster\\naround her, asking questions—some in sorrow\\nabout their absent master; others glad\\nto eat at his expense. I ask no questions,\\nsince an Aetolian fooled me with his lies.\\nHe came to my house, saying he had killed\\na man in distant parts and run away. \\nI welcomed him. He said that he had seen\\nOdysseus with Idomeneus\\nin Crete, repairing ships that storms had wrecked.\\nHe promised that my lord would come in summer\\nor harvesttime, made rich by heaps of treasure,\\nhis crew complete. A god has brought you here;\\nbut do not try to trick me or make nice\\nwith lies. I will be kind to you, old man,\\nnot for your stories, but in fear of Zeus,\\nthe god of strangers, and because I feel \\npity for you.”\\nBut sly Odysseus\\nanswered, “You are too skeptical! Despite\\nmy oath, I see you will not trust me. May\\nthe gods of Mount Olympus be our witness\\nthat if your master ever comes back home\\nto this house, you will give me clothes to wear,\\nand help me to Dulichium—I want\\nto go there. But if he does not arrive,\\nand I am wrong, your slaves can drive me over\\nthe cliﬀ tops, so no other beggar tries \\nto trick you.”\\nBut the upright swineherd answered,\\n“Yes, guest, I would be praised enormously\\namong all men, now and in times to come,\\nif I took you inside and welcomed you,\\nthen murdered you! And doing this,\\nwith what clean conscience could I pray to Zeus?\\nIn any case, now it is dinnertime.\\nMy men should come inside, so we can cook\\ndelicious food.”\\nThat was their conversation.\\nIn came the herdsmen, and they drove the pigs \\ninto their usual pens to rest; there rose\\na mighty din of grunting pigs. The noble\\nswineherd addressed his men.\\n“Bring out the best\\npig for our guest, who comes from distant lands.\\nAnd let us all enjoy ourselves. We suﬀer\\nin bitter toil for these white-tusked pigs,\\nwhile others eat the food we labor for,\\nand give us nothing.”\\nWith a keen bronze axe\\nhe chopped the wood. They brought a fattened pig\\nof five years old and put it on the altar. \\nThe swineherd’s heart was good: he kept in mind\\nthe gods. He shaved the bristles oﬀ its head,\\nand threw them in the fire, and prayed to all\\nthe gods, that through his ingenuity,\\nhis master would come home. He stretched up\\ntall, and used a piece of oaken firewood\\nto strike. The life departed, and they slit\\nthe throat and singed the hide, and chopped it up.\\nThe swineherd made an oﬀering of meat,\\nlaid flesh across the fine rich fat, and put it \\nupon the fire with barley-grain on top,\\nand sliced the rest and put it all on skewers,\\nand roasted it with care, then drew the meat oﬀ\\nand heaped it high on platters. Next he stood\\nand served it out in seven equal parts,\\nthe first with prayers, for Hermes and the Nymphs,\\nand then he served the others to the men.\\nHe gave Odysseus the piece of honor,\\ncut from the spine. His master was delighted,\\nand said,\\n“Eumaeus, may Zeus bless and love you \\nas I do, since you give me such good things.”\\nYou answered him, swineherd Eumaeus, “Eat,\\ndear guest; enjoy it, simple though it is.\\nGods give, gods take away, as is their will;\\nto gods all things are possible.”\\nWith that,\\nhe made the sacrifices to the gods,\\npoured a libation from the bright red wine,\\nthen gave Odysseus, the city-sacker,\\nthe cup. At last the swineherd sat to eat.\\nMesaulius served the food—that was the slave \\nbought by Eumaeus in his master’s absence,\\nwith no help from his mistress or Laertes.\\nHe traded him from Taphians. They all\\nreached out to take the good things set before them.\\nWhen they had had enough of food and drink,\\nMesaulius cleared things away; the men\\nwere full of bread and meat, and wanting sleep.\\nNight fell, a moonless, bitter night. Zeus rained\\ncontinually; wet Zephyr blew his hardest.\\nOdysseus—to test out if Eumaeus \\nwas kind enough to take his own cloak oﬀ,\\nor tell another man to do it—said,\\n“Eumaeus and you others, all of you.\\nI want to brag a little. I am dizzy,\\nunder the influence of wine, which makes\\neven the wisest people sing and giggle,\\nand dance, and say things best not spoken. Since\\nI have begun this blabbering, here goes,\\nI will be honest. I wish I was young\\nand strong again! As when we planned an ambush \\nunder the walls of Troy—the leading men\\nwere Menelaus and Odysseus,\\nand I was chosen as the third commander.\\nWhen we had reached the city wall, we lay\\nin bushes, reeds, and marshes, hiding under\\nour shields. Night fell, harsh and icy cold,\\nwith North Wind and a sleetlike snow, so cold\\nthe ice grew on our weapons. All the others\\nhad cloaks; they slept in comfort, tucked beneath\\ntheir shields. But I had foolishly forgotten \\nmy cloak and left it, not expecting cold.\\nI carried just my shield and shining belt.\\nIn the last part of night, as stars were setting,\\nI went near to Odysseus and nudged him.\\nHe listened to me carefully. I said,\\n‘Your Majesty, Odysseus, great general,\\nI am about to die from this cold weather!\\nI have no cloak. Some spirit tricked me into\\nwearing my tunic only; now there is\\nno way to fix it.’ Instantly he thought \\nof this solution. What a strategist\\nand fighter! Very quietly he whispered,\\n‘Hush now, do not let any of the others\\nhear you.’ He propped his head up on his elbow,\\nand told them, ‘Listen, friends. I had a dream\\nsent by the gods. We moved too far away\\nfrom where the ships are. Someone needs to speak\\nto Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,\\nand tell him to send more troops here.’ At that,\\nThoas the son of Andraimon leapt up, \\ntook oﬀ his purple cloak and sprinted down\\ntowards the ships. I snuggled down in comfort\\nunder his cloak till golden Dawn shone bright.\\nIf only I was young and strong again!\\nThen one of these pig-keepers on this farm\\nwould give a cloak to me, both from respect\\nand friendship. As it is, they all despise me\\nfor wearing dirty rags.”\\nEumaeus, you\\nreplied, “That was a splendid tale, old man!\\nIt worked. You will get all the clothes and things \\na poor old beggar needs—at least for now.\\nBut in the morning, you will have to put\\nyour old rags on again. We only have\\none outfit each, no spares. My master’s son\\nwill give you clothes when he arrives, and help you\\nto travel on wherever you desire.”\\nWith that, he stood and set a bed for him\\nbeside the fire, and threw on it some skins\\nof sheep and goats. Odysseus lay down.\\nEumaeus tucked him in a big thick cloak, \\nhis extra one, for really bitter weather.\\nOdysseus went to sleep; the young men slept\\nbeside him. But the swineherd did not like\\nto sleep so distant from the pigs; he started\\nto leave. Odysseus was glad the slave\\ntook good care of his absent master’s things.\\nEumaeus slung his sharp sword belt across\\nhis well-toned back, and wrapped around himself\\nhis windproof cloak and fine big furry goatskin.\\nHe took a sharpened knife to ward away \\nhumans or dogs, and he went oﬀ to sleep\\nout where the pigs with silver tusks were sleeping;\\na hanging rock protected them from wind.\\nBOOK \\nThe Prince Returns\\nAthena went to Sparta, to ensure\\nthe safe return of Prince Telemachus.\\nShe found him with Pisistratus, both lying\\non Menelaus’ porch, and Nestor’s son\\nwas fast asleep, but no sweet slumber held\\nTelemachus. His worries for his father\\nkept him awake all through god-given night.\\nOwl-eyed Athena stood by him and said,\\n“Telemachus, you should no longer travel\\nso far from home, abandoning your wealth, \\nwith greedy men at home. You must watch out;\\nThey may divide and eat up all your wealth,\\nand make your journey useless. Quickly ask\\nfor help from Menelaus to get home,\\nso you may find your mother safe and blameless.\\nHer father and her brothers are already\\ntelling her she should wed Eurymachus.\\nHe is the one most generous with gifts\\nto her and to her father. Do not let her\\ntake any items from the house, without \\nyour full consent. You know how women are—\\nthey want to help the house of any man\\nthey marry. When one darling husband dies,\\nhis wife forgets him, and her children by him.\\nShe does not even ask how they are doing.\\nLet your best slave girl watch your property,\\nuntil the gods give you your own wife. Also,\\nI have more news: take note. There is a gang\\nof suitors lurking in the stream between\\nyour Ithaca and rocky Same, who \\nhave plans to kill you on your journey home.\\nBut I suspect that some of those who waste\\nyour wealth will soon be lying under earth.\\nNow steer your ship far distant from the islands,\\nand sail both day and night. Some god who guards\\nand watches over you will send fair wind\\nbehind your sails. When you first reach the shore\\nof Ithaca, your men must drag the ship\\nup to the town, while you first go and visit\\nthe swineherd, who is better than most slaves. \\nSpend the night there. Tell him to go to town\\nto tell Penelope that you have come\\nsafely back home from Pylos.”\\nWith these words\\nthe goddess went back up to Mount Olympus.\\nHe woke the son of Nestor with a kick,\\nand said to him,\\n“Pisistratus! Go fetch\\nthe horses, get them harnessed to the carriage,\\nand let us hurry on our way.”\\nHe answered,\\n“Telemachus, this is impossible,\\nfor us to drive when it is pitch-black night, \\nhowever eager we may be to travel.\\nDawn will come soon. Wait till great Menelaus\\ncomes out to bring us presents in his carriage,\\nand sends us on our way with friendly words.\\nA generous host is sure to be remembered\\nas long as his guests live.”\\nThen all at once\\nDawn on her golden throne lit up the sky.\\nKing Menelaus got up from the bed\\nhe shared with fair-haired Helen and approached them.\\nSeeing him on his way, Telemachus \\nput on his bright white tunic, and then slung\\nhis mighty sword across his sturdy shoulders.\\nSo in a warlike guise, the well-loved son\\nof godlike King Odysseus stood near\\nand spoke to Menelaus.\\n“Royal son\\nof Atreus, now, please, send me home now,\\nto my beloved country. My heart yearns\\nto go back home.”\\nAnd Menelaus answered,\\n“Telemachus, I will not keep you here\\nif you are truly desperate for home. \\nI disapprove of too much friendliness\\nand of too much standoﬃshness. A balance\\nis best. To force a visitor to stay\\nis just as bad as pushing him to go.\\nBe kind to guests while they are visiting,\\nthen help them on their way. So friend, remain\\njust till I fetch some splendid gifts to pile\\nonto your carriage. Wait till you see them!\\nI will instruct the women to prepare\\na banquet in the hall from our rich stores. \\nFeasting before a long trip brings you honor;\\nit also makes good sense. And if you want\\nto have me travel with you all through Greece,\\nI shall yoke up my horses and escort you\\nthrough every town, and everywhere we go\\nwe will be given gifts—a fine bronze tripod,\\na cauldron, or two mules, or golden cups.”\\nTelemachus replied, “King Menelaus,\\nI want to go home right away. I have\\nno one back there to watch my property. \\nI would not want to die while I am searching\\nfor Father, or to lose my wealth at home.”\\nSo General Menelaus shouted out\\nto tell his wife and female slaves to make\\na feast from his rich stores. Eteoneus\\ngot out of bed and came—he lived nearby.\\nThe general boomed out orders: “Light the fire\\nand roast the meat!” The slave obeyed. Meanwhile,\\nhis master went inside the fragrant room\\ncontaining treasures. Helen went with him, \\nand Megapenthes. There he took a goblet,\\ntwo-handled, and he told his son to bring\\na silver bowl. And Helen stood beside\\nthe chests in which she kept the special clothes\\nthat she had worked with her own hands. She lifted\\nthe most elaborate and largest robe\\nthat shone like starlight under all the rest.\\nThen they went through the palace till they reached\\nTelemachus. And fair-haired Menelaus\\nsaid to him,\\n“May great Zeus, the Lord of Thunder, \\nhusband of Hera, make your wish come true—\\nmay you go back home safely. I will give you\\nthe best of all my treasure, as a mark\\nof deep respect: a bowl of solid silver,\\ncircled with gold; Hephaestus fashioned it.\\nThe King of Sidon, Phaedimus, bestowed it\\non me when I was at his house, en route\\nfor home. Now take it; it is yours.”\\nHe gave\\nthe goblet first, and Megapenthes brought\\nthe shining silver bowl and put it down \\nin front of him. Then Helen’s lovely cheeks\\nflushed as she moved in close. She held the robe\\nand said,\\n“Sweet boy, I also have a gift,\\ncrafted by my own hands. Remember Helen\\nwhen your own wedding day at last arrives,\\nand let your bride wear this. Until that time,\\nyour mother should take care of it. I wish you\\ngreat joy. I hope you reach your well-built home,\\nand fatherland.”\\nShe handed it to him;\\nhe took it gladly. Prince Pisistratus \\ntook all the gifts and packed them in the luggage,\\nand marveled at them in his heart.\\nThe king\\nled them inside; they sat on chairs. A slave girl\\nbrought out a beautiful gold water pitcher\\nand silver bowl so she could wash their hands.\\nShe set a polished table at their side.\\nAnother lowly girl brought bread and food\\nof every kind. Boethoedes began\\nto carve and serve the meat. The king’s son poured\\nthe wine for everyone. They helped themselves \\nto all the delicacies spread before them.\\nWhen they were satisfied, Telemachus\\nand Nestor’s son strapped on the horses’ harness,\\nand yoked them to the chariot and drove\\noﬀ from the echoing portico and gate.\\nBut Menelaus ran up just behind them,\\nholding a golden cup of honeyed wine\\nin his right hand, so they could pour libations\\nbefore they left. He stopped in front of them\\nand spreading wide his arms said,\\n“Boys, good luck! \\nGive Nestor my best wishes—he was always\\nas kind as any father while we Greeks\\nwere making war in Troy.”\\nTelemachus\\nsaid carefully, “Yes, king, when we go there\\nwe will pass on what you have said. I hope\\nI may go back to Ithaca and meet\\nOdysseus—good luck to match my fortune\\nin all your generosity and kindness.”\\nThen on the right an eagle flew; it held\\na big white goose clutched in its claws—a tame one, \\ncaught from the yard. The people, men and women,\\nwere running round and yelling after it.\\nIt darted on the right beside the boys,\\nand flew before their horses. They were all\\ndelighted. Nestor’s son was first to speak.\\n“My lord, King Menelaus, what do you think?\\nWas this a sign sent by some god for us?\\nOr sent for you?”\\nAnd Menelaus, favorite\\nof Ares, wondered how he ought to answer.\\nBut Helen cut in first and said, “Now listen, \\nand I will make a prophecy. The gods\\nhave put it in my heart and I believe\\nit will come true. Just as the eagle flew\\ndown from the mountains where he has his home\\nwith chicks and parents, seizing this tame goose—\\nso will Odysseus, who has been gone\\nso long and has endured so much, come back\\nand take revenge. Indeed, he is already\\nat home and planting ruin for the suitors.”\\nTelemachus replied, “May thundering Zeus \\nfulfill your prophecy at once! If so,\\nI would bow down to you as to a goddess.”\\nHe whipped the horses and they galloped oﬀ\\nthrough the town center to the open plain.\\nAll day the harness rattled as they ran.\\nBut when the sun went down and it grew dark,\\nthey came to Pherae, home of Diocles,\\nson of Ortilochus, who was the son\\nof Alpheus. He welcomed them and there\\nthey spent the night. When rosy-fingered Dawn \\nthe early-born appeared, they yoked the horses,\\nclimbed in the chariot, and drove away\\nfrom the resounding portico and gate.\\nThe horses flew with gusto at the whip.\\nSoon they were near the rocky town of Pylos.\\nTelemachus then asked Pisistratus,\\n“Would you do me a favor? We are friends\\nbecause our fathers have been friends forever,\\nand we are age-mates, and this trip has made us\\neven more intimate. Please do not bring me \\nbeyond my ship, but leave me here, in case\\nthe old man forces me to visit him\\nand be his guest. I long to get back home.\\nI have to go, and fast.”\\nThe son of Nestor\\nwondered how he should best respond. He thought\\nupon reflection he should turn the horses\\nback to the ship and shore beside the sea.\\nThere he took out the splendid gifts and clothes\\nand gold from Menelaus, and he packed them\\ninside the stern, and told Telemachus, \\n“Hurry! Embark now! Get your crew in too,\\nbefore I get back home and tell my father\\nthat you are here. I know him; he is stubborn.\\nHe will not let you go; he will come here\\nto fetch you, and he surely will not leave\\nwithout you. He will be in such a rage!”\\nWith that, he spurred the horses. Long manes flowing,\\nthey galloped to the citadel of Pylos.\\nTelemachus gave orders: “Make it all\\nshipshape, my friends, and get on board, so we \\ncan start our journey.”\\nQuickly they obeyed\\nand sat along the benches. As he worked,\\nwith prayers and sacrifices to Athena,\\na foreigner approached him, who had killed\\na man in Argos and had run away.\\nHe was a prophet and descended from\\nMelampus, who once lived in Pylos, land\\nof sheep. Melampus had been rich, and owned\\na palace, but he left his home, escaping\\nfrom Neleus, a proud, important man, \\nwho seized all his great wealth while he was trapped\\nand tortured in the house of Phylacus,\\nbecause a Fury put inside his mind\\na dangerous obsession with the daughter\\nof Neleus. He managed to escape,\\nand drove the cattle, lowing loudly, oﬀ\\nfrom Phylace to Pylos. He avenged\\nthe wrong that Neleus had done to him,\\nand brought the woman to his brother’s house\\nas wife, then went to Argos, home of horses, \\nsince there it was his destiny to rule\\nthe multitude of Argives, and he had\\ntwo strong sons: Mantius, and Antiphates,\\nwho fathered the heroic Oicles,\\nwhose son was Amphiaraus, the warlord,\\nwhom Zeus who holds the aegis and Apollo\\nadored wholeheartedly. But he did not\\nlive to old age, since he was killed at Thebes,\\nbecause his wife took bribes. He had two sons,\\nAmphilochus and Alcmaeon. The sons \\nof Mantius were Clitus, snatched by Dawn\\nto join the gods, because he was so handsome,\\nand Polypheides, whom Apollo gave\\nthe best prophetic skill of any mortal\\nafter Amphiaraus had died. This prophet\\ngrew angry with his father, and migrated\\nto Hyperisia, and there he told\\nfortunes for everyone. It was his son,\\nnamed Theoclymenus, who had approached\\nTelemachus while he was pouring wine \\nand praying to the gods. The stranger said,\\n“My friend, I find you making sacrifices.\\nI beg you, by religion, by the gods,\\nand by your life and your men’s lives: who are you?\\nWho are your parents? What is your home town?”\\nTelemachus said, “Stranger, I will tell you.\\nI come from Ithaca; my father is\\nOdysseus—he was. He must have died\\nsome dreadful death by now. It was for him\\nI got this ship and crew. I sailed to seek \\nnews of my absent father.”\\nAnd the stranger\\nreplied, “I too am far from home. I killed\\na man of my own tribe, and I have many\\nbrothers and kinsmen, powerful in Argos,\\nso I am on the run. They want to kill me.\\nI have been doomed to homelessness. But please,\\nlet me on board your ship. I come to you\\nin desperation—otherwise I will\\nsurely be killed. Those men are after me.”\\nTelemachus said, “Yes, you can join us \\non board our ship. And what we have is yours;\\nyou are our guest.”\\nHe took the stranger’s spear,\\nlaid it on deck, then climbed on board himself,\\nsat at the stern, and had his guest sit down\\nbeside him at the stern. They loosed the ropes.\\nTelemachus gave orders to the men\\nto seize the tackle; promptly they obeyed,\\nand raised the wooden mast and fastened it\\ninto the socket, binding it with forestays,\\nand hauled the white sail up with leather cables. \\nSharp-eyed Athena sent fair wind that gusted\\na wild explosive breath through bright clear sky;\\nthe ship began to race across the sea,\\npast Crouni and the lovely streams of Chalcis.\\nThe sun went down and all the world was dark.\\nImpelled by wind from Zeus, the ship sped on\\npast Phaea and they came to famous Elis\\nruled by the Epeians; from there they steered\\ntowards the Needle Islands, still unsure\\nif they would die.\\nMeanwhile, Odysseus \\nwas having dinner with the noble swineherd\\ninside the cottage, and the other men\\nwere eating with them. After they were done,\\nOdysseus began to test the swineherd,\\nto see if he would be hospitable,\\nand ask him to stay there, out on the farm,\\nor send him into town. He said,\\n“Eumaeus,\\nlisten, and listen all of you. At dawn\\nI plan to go to town to beg—I have\\nno wish to be a burden to you all. \\nI only need directions and a guide\\nwho can go with me. I will roam around\\nthe city on my own, in search of drink\\nand crusts of bread—so it must be. And if\\nI reach the house of King Odysseus,\\nI plan to tell Penelope my news,\\nand mingle with the high and mighty suitors;\\nthey may give me some food from their rich stores.\\nI could do anything they want at once.\\nI have the capability, you see. \\nHermes the messenger, the god who gives\\nfavor and glorifies all human labor,\\nhas blessed me with unrivaled skill in all\\ndomestic tasks: fire-laying, splitting logs,\\ncarving and roasting meat, and pouring wine—\\nI can do all the chores poor people do\\nto serve the rich.”\\nBut angrily you said,\\nEumaeus, “No! Why would you think of this?\\nYou would be killed if you set foot among\\nthat horde of suitors; their aggression reaches \\nthe iron sky. And those who wait on them\\nare not like you. They are young men, well dressed,\\nwith bright clean hair and handsome faces, serving\\nthe bread and wine and meat, piled high upon\\ntheir polished tables. Stay here. No one minds\\nyour presence—not myself, nor my companions.\\nAnd when Odysseus’ son arrives,\\nhe will provide a proper cloak and tunic,\\nand help you travel where your heart desires.”\\nOdysseus, experienced in pain, \\nanswered, “I hope Zeus loves you as I do,\\nsince you have saved me from the agonies\\nof wandering. The worst thing humans suﬀer\\nis homelessness; we must endure this life\\nbecause of desperate hunger; we endure,\\nas migrants with no home. But since you now\\nwant me to stay and wait for your young master,\\ntell me about Odysseus’ parents.\\nHis father, when he left, was on the threshold\\nof age. Are they alive still? Have they died?” \\nHe answered, “Stranger, I will tell you truly.\\nLaertes is alive, but he is always\\npraying to Zeus to let him pass away\\nin his own home. He feels such desperate grief\\nabout his son and his beloved wife,\\nwhose death made him so heartbroken, he aged\\nbefore his time. She died a dreadful death,\\na death I would not wish for any friend—\\ngrieving her absent son, the famous hero.\\nWhile she was still alive, despite her sadness, \\nshe used to like to talk and chat with me—\\nshe brought me up herself with her own daughter,\\nstrong, pretty Ctimene, her youngest child.\\nShe raised us both together, treating me\\nalmost as equal, just a little less.\\nAnd when we came of age, they sent the girl\\nto Same, for a hefty bridal-price.\\nThe mother dressed me in fine clothes, a cloak\\nand tunic, tying sandals on my feet,\\nand sent me to the country. But she still \\nloved me with all her heart. I miss them both.\\nThe blessed gods have made my work here prosper,\\nso I have had enough to eat and drink\\nand give to guests. But I hear no good news\\nabout my mistress. Ruin has befallen\\nthe house from those invaders. All her slaves\\nmiss talking to their owner, getting gossip,\\nsharing some food and drink with her, and taking\\nscraps to the fields with them—the kind of thing\\nthat makes slaves happy.”\\nAnd Odysseus \\nexclaimed, “Eumaeus! What a little child\\nyou were when you were taken far from home\\nand from your parents! Tell me more. Did they\\nlive in a city that was sacked? Or was it\\nbandits that found you, herding sheep or cows\\nalone? Did they seize hold of you and put you\\nonto their ship, and sell you for a profit\\nin this man’s house?”\\nThe swineherd answered him,\\n“Since you have asked this question, stranger, listen;\\nenjoy my story, sitting quietly, \\ndrinking your wine. These nights are magical,\\nwith time enough to sleep and to enjoy\\nhearing a tale. You need not sleep too early;\\nit is unhealthy. Any other man\\nwho feels the need of sleep should go lie down,\\nget up at dawn, have breakfast, and go herd\\nthe master’s pigs. But let us, you and I,\\nsit in my cottage over food and wine,\\nand take some joy in hearing how much pain\\nwe each have suﬀered. After many years \\nof agony and absence from one’s home,\\na person can begin enjoying grief.\\nI will tell you my story as you ask.\\nThere is an island—you may know it—called\\nSyria, where the sun turns round, above\\nOrtygia. It has few inhabitants,\\nbut it is good land, rich in sheep and wine\\nand grain; no famine ever hurts those there,\\nnor any deadly sickness. They grow old,\\nand with their gentle arrows, Artemis \\nand silver-bowed Apollo cause their death.\\nThe land is split into two provinces;\\nmy father Ctesius was king of both.\\nThen avaricious merchants came—Phoenicians,\\nskilled sailors, with great piles of treasure stored\\nin their black ship. And in my father’s house\\nthere was a woman from Phoenicia—tall\\nand beautiful and skilled in many arts.\\nThose clever rascals tricked her. One of them\\nfirst found her washing clothes beside the ship \\nand lay with her. Sex sways all women’s minds,\\neven the best of them. And then he asked her\\nwhere she was from and who she was; she showed him\\nmy father’s palace, and she said, ‘I am\\nfrom Sidon, rich in bronze. I am the daughter\\nof wealthy Arybas; as I was walking\\nback from the fields one day, some Taphian pirates\\nkidnapped me, brought me here to this man’s house,\\nand sold me to him, for a tidy sum.’\\nHer secret lover said, ‘Then would you like \\nto go back home with us, and see your parents\\nand your fine home again? They are alive\\nand quite rich now.’ The woman said, ‘Oh, yes,\\nI would! If all you sailors swear an oath\\nto bring me safely home.’ At that, they swore\\nas she had asked, and made their solemn vows.\\nAnd then the woman said, ‘You must keep mum,\\nand none of you can even speak to me\\nif you bump into me beside the road\\nor at the water fountain—otherwise \\nsomeone might tell the old man at the house.\\nThen he would get suspicious, chain me up,\\nand plan to have you killed. Remember this,\\nbear it in mind and do your trading quickly,\\nand when your ship is full of stores to take\\nback home with you, send news to me, and fast.\\nI will bring gold with me as well, whatever\\nwealth I can find to hand. I also want\\nto give another gift to pay my fare.\\nI take care of my master’s clever son— \\nwho always runs around outside with me.\\nI will bring him on board and he will fetch\\na pretty price from foreigners.’ With that,\\nshe went back to the palace. For a year\\nthey stayed with us accumulating wealth\\nby trading, and they filled their ship’s hold up.\\nWhen it was time to go, they sent a man\\nto tell the woman at my father’s house.\\nHe was a very cunning man. He wore\\na golden necklace strung with amber beads; \\nthe slave girls in the palace and my mother\\nstared and began to finger it and ask\\nhow much it cost; he nodded to the woman\\nin silence, and then went back to the ship.\\nShe took me by the hand and led me out\\ninto the forecourt, where she found some cups\\nleft on the tables by my father’s men\\nwho had been banqueting, and now had gone\\nto council—they were having a debate.\\nShe took three cups and hid them in her dress \\nand carried them away with her. I followed,\\nknowing no better. As the sun went down,\\nwe hurried through the dark streets to the harbor.\\nThere was the swift Phoenician ship. They all\\nembarked, put us on board as well, and sailed\\nover the watery waves; Zeus sent fair wind.\\nFor seven days we sailed and on the eighth,\\nArtemis struck the woman with her arrows.\\nShe crashed into the ship’s hold like a seagull.\\nThey threw her overboard to feed the fish \\nand seals, and I was left there, brokenhearted.\\nThe current carried them to Ithaca,\\nand then Laertes bought me with his wealth.\\nThat was the way my eyes first saw this land.”\\nOdysseus replied, “My heart is touched\\nto hear the story of your suﬀerings,\\nEumaeus. In the end, though, Zeus has blessed you,\\nsince after going through all that, you came\\nto live with someone kind, a man who gives you\\nplenty to eat and drink. Your life is good. \\nBut as for me, I am still lost; I trekked\\nthrough many towns before I wandered here.”\\nSo went their conversation; then they slept\\nfor just a little while; Dawn soon arrived\\nupon her throne.\\nMeanwhile, Telemachus\\ndrew near the mainland. Lowering the sail\\nnimbly, his men took down the mast and rowed\\nto anchorage. They cast the mooring stones,\\nand tied the cables from the stern, then climbed\\nout in the surf, and waded into shore. \\nThere they made dinner, mixing bright red wine.\\nWhen they had had enough to eat and drink,\\nthe boy said sensibly,\\n“You all should drag\\nthe ship towards the town, while I go visit\\nthe herdsmen in the fields of my estate.\\nThen I will come to town, at evening time.\\nAt dawn, I will provide a feast for you\\nof meat and wine.”\\nThen Theoclymenus\\nasked him, “But where shall I go, my dear boy?\\nTo whose house? One of those who rule this land? \\nOr should I go at once to your own mother\\nin your house?”\\nAnd Telemachus replied,\\n“Well, ordinarily I would invite you.\\nWe are good hosts. But as it is—best not,\\nfor your own sake. I will not be at home,\\nand Mother will not see you; she is weaving\\nupstairs upon her loom—she does not want\\nthe suitors seeing her. So I suggest\\nyou go to someone else’s house: the son\\nof skillful Polybus, Eurymachus. \\nThe Ithacans look at him as a god.\\nHe is the dominant suitor and the keenest\\non marrying my mother and acquiring\\nthe riches of Odysseus. Zeus knows\\nthe future, he alone. Eurymachus\\nmay die a dreadful death before that marriage.”\\nAs he said this, a bird flew on his right:\\na hawk, Apollo’s messenger. It clutched\\na pigeon in its talons; feathers scattered\\nbetween the ship and young Telemachus. \\nThen Theoclymenus called him aside\\nand grasped him by the hand, and said to him,\\n“Telemachus! Some god has sent this bird\\nto fly on your right hand. I knew at once\\nit was a sign. No family in all\\nof Ithaca has greater power; you are\\nthe kings forever.”\\nHe replied, “Oh, stranger!\\nI hope your words come true! If so, I would\\ngive you so many gifts to show my friendship\\nthat everyone you met would be impressed.” \\nAnd then he told his faithful man, “Piraeus,\\nyou were most trustworthy of those who came\\nwith me to Pylos. Let this stranger come\\nto your own house, be kind to him and give him\\na cordial welcome till I come.”\\nPiraeus\\nanswered, “However long you are away,\\nI will take care of him.”\\nAnd then he climbed\\naboard and told the men to come as well,\\nand loose the cables, which they did, and sat\\ndown on the benches. Then Telemachus \\ntied on his sandals, and took from the deck\\nhis sharp bronze spear. The men untied the ropes\\nand sailed towards the town, just as the son\\nof great Odysseus had ordered them.\\nThe boy walked quickly till he reached the farmyard.\\nHundreds of pigs were there and with them slept\\nthe swineherd who knew how to help his masters.\\nBOOK \\nFather and Son\\nAt dawn the swineherd and Odysseus\\nmade breakfast, lit the fire, and sent the herdsmen\\nout with the pigs that they had rounded up.\\nThe dogs, that as a rule would bark at strangers,\\nwere quiet when they saw Telemachus;\\nthey panted at him. When Odysseus\\nsaw how they acted, and heard footsteps coming,\\nhe said,\\n“Eumaeus, someone must be coming—\\na friend or somebody you know—the dogs\\nare friendly, with no barking. I can hear \\nfootsteps.”\\nHe hardly finished, when his son,\\nhis own dear son, was there inside the gate.\\nAmazed, the swineherd jumped up, letting fall\\nthe cups in which he had been mixing wine;\\nit spilled. He ran towards his master, kissed\\nhis face and shining eyes and both his hands,\\nand wept. Just as a father, when he sees\\nhis own dear son, his only son, his dear\\nmost precious boy, returned from foreign lands\\nafter ten years of grieving for his loss, \\nwelcomes him; so the swineherd wrapped his arms\\naround godlike Telemachus and kissed him,\\nas if he were returning from the dead.\\nWith tears still in his eyes he said,\\n“Sweet light!\\nYou have come back, Telemachus. I thought\\nthat I would never see you anymore,\\nafter you sailed to Pylos. My dear child,\\ncome in, let me enjoy the sight of you\\nnow you are back. Come in! You do not often\\ncome to the countryside to see us herders; \\nyou stay in town to watch that evil horde\\nof suitors.”\\nAnd Telemachus replied\\nwarily, “Grandpa, yes, I will come in.\\nI came to see you here with my own eyes,\\nand hear if Mother still stays in the house,\\nor if some other man has married her\\nalready, and Odysseus’ bed\\nis empty, full of ugly spiderwebs.”\\nThe swineherd, the commander, said, “Indeed,\\nher heart is loyal. She is in your house, \\nweeping by night and sad by day.”\\nHe took\\nTelemachus’ sword; the boy came in,\\ncrossing the stony threshold, and his father\\noﬀered his seat. Telemachus refused,\\nsaying, “You sit there, stranger. I can find\\na chair around my hut. The slave can help.”\\nOdysseus went back and sat back down.\\nThe swineherd spread fresh brushwood and a fleece\\non top, so that Telemachus could sit. \\nHe set the bread in baskets and brought meat,\\nleft over from the meal the day before.\\nHe mixed some wine up in a wooden bowl,\\nand sat down opposite Odysseus.\\nThey reached to take the good things set before them.\\nWhen they were satisfied, Telemachus\\nturned to the noble swineherd.\\n“Tell me, Grandpa,\\nwhere did this stranger come from? By what route\\ndid sailors bring him here? And who were they?\\nHe surely did not walk to Ithaca!” \\nEumaeus answered, “I will tell you, child.\\nHe is from Crete. He says he wandered, lost\\nthrough many towns—so some god spun his fate.\\nNow he has run away from the Thesprotians\\nwho brought him, and arrived here on my farm.\\nHe is all yours, your suppliant, to treat\\nhowever you desire.”\\nTelemachus\\nsaid anxiously, “This news of yours, Eumaeus,\\nis very worrying to me. How can I\\ninvite him to my house? I am too young \\nto fight back with my fists if someone picks\\na fight with me. My mother is unsure\\nif she should stay with me and show respect\\ntowards her husband’s bed and public gossip,\\nand keep on taking care of things at home,\\nor marry one of them, whichever suitor\\nasserts himself, and brings most lavish gifts.\\nBut since this man has come here, to your house,\\nI will dress him in fine clothes, cloak and tunic,\\nand sandals for his feet, and give a sword, \\nand help him on his way. If you are willing,\\nkeep him here in the farmhouse; care for him.\\nI will send you some clothes and all his food,\\nso he will be no bother to these men\\nor you. I will not let him go to meet\\nthe suitors; they are much too violent.\\nI would be mortified if they abused him.\\nIt would be diﬃcult for one man, even\\na strong one, to do anything to them.\\nThey are too many.”\\nThen Odysseus, \\nfrustrated, said, “My friend, it is my duty\\nto speak out when I hear the dreadful things\\nthose suitors have been doing in your house,\\nagainst your will; it breaks my heart. You are\\na good man. Tell me, did you choose to let them\\nbully you? Have the Ithacans been turned\\nagainst you by some god? Or do you blame\\nyour brothers, who should be a man’s supporters\\nwhen conflict comes? If only I had youth\\nto match my will! I wish I were the son \\nof great Odysseus—or that I were\\nthe man himself come home from wandering.\\nWe can still hope. Let someone chop my head oﬀ,\\nif I would not destroy them when I came\\ninside the palace of Odysseus!\\nAnd if I lost—since I am only one\\nagainst so many—I would rather die\\nin my own house, than watch such crimes committed!\\nStrangers dishonored! Slave girls dragged around,\\nraped in my lovely home! Men wasting wine \\nand bread—for nothing! For this waiting game!”\\nTelemachus said soberly, “I will\\nexplain the situation to you, stranger.\\nThe Ithacans are not my enemies,\\nand I do not have brothers I can blame.\\nZeus gave my family a single line:\\nArcesius had just one son, Laertes,\\nwho had Odysseus, his only son,\\nand he had me, his only son, whom he\\nleft back at home; he had no joy of me. \\nAnd now there are so many cruel invaders,\\nsince all the toughest men from all the islands—\\nfrom Same and Dulichium and wooded\\nZacynthus, and all those who hold command\\nin rocky Ithaca, have come to court\\nmy mother, wasting all my wealth. She does not\\nrefuse the awful prospect of remarriage,\\nnor can she end the courtship. They keep eating,\\nconsuming my whole house, and soon they may\\ndestroy me too. These things lie with the gods. \\nNow Grandpa, you must hurry to the queen,\\nand tell her I am safe back home from Pylos.\\nI will stay here while you tell her—just her;\\ndo not let any others hear the news,\\nsince many people want to plot my death.”\\nEumaeus, you replied, “I understand.\\nBut tell me, on this same trip, should I go\\nand tell poor old Laertes? For a while\\nhe used to watch the fields and join the slaves\\nfor dinner at the house, when in the mood, \\ndespite his grief for lost Odysseus.\\nBut since your ship set sail away to Pylos,\\nthey say he has stopped eating, will not drink,\\nand does not go to check the fields. He sits,\\nweeping and sobbing, worn to skin and bone.”\\nTelemachus said calmly, “That is sad;\\ndistressing news. But no, leave him alone.\\nIf human wishes could come true, my first\\nwould be to have my father come back home.\\nTake her your message, hurry back, and do not \\ntrail round the countryside to look for him.\\nTell Mother she should send a girl in secret\\nto run to old Laertes with the news.”\\nAt that, the swineherd tied his sandals on,\\nand started oﬀ towards the town. Athena\\nnoticed him leaving from the yard, and stood\\nbeside him as a woman, tall and skillful,\\nand beautiful. Odysseus could see her,\\nstanding beside the entrance to the cottage.\\nTelemachus could not; the gods are not \\nequally visible to everyone.\\nThe dogs could see her but they did not bark.\\nThey whimpered and slunk back across the room\\nin fear. She raised her eyebrows, with a nod;\\nhe understood and came out, past the wall,\\nand stood beside her. Then Athena told him,\\n“Odysseus, great strategist, it is\\ntime for your son to know the truth; together\\nyou have to plan how you will kill the suitors.\\nThen both of you go into town. I will \\njoin you there soon myself; indeed I am\\nitching to fight.”\\nAnd then Athena touched him,\\nusing a golden wand, and dressed him up\\nin fine clean cloak and tunic, and she made him\\ntaller and younger-looking. He became\\ntanned, and his cheeks filled out, and on his chin\\nthe beard grew dark. And so her work was done,\\nand oﬀ she flew. Odysseus went in.\\nHis son was startled and looked down, afraid\\nin case it was a god. His words flew out. \\n“Stranger, you look so diﬀerent from before.\\nYour clothes, your skin—I think that you must be\\nsome god who has descended from the sky.\\nBe kind to us, and we will sacrifice,\\nand give you golden treasures. Pity us!”\\nLong-suﬀering Odysseus replied,\\n“I am no god. Why would you think such things?\\nI am your father, that same man you mourn.\\nIt is because of me these brutal men\\nare hurting you so badly.”\\nThen he kissed \\nhis son and cried, tears pouring down his cheeks;\\nhe had been holding back till then. The boy\\ndid not yet trust it really was his father,\\nand said,\\n“No, you are not Odysseus,\\nmy father; some god must have cast a spell,\\nto cause me further pain. No mortal man\\ncould manage such a thing by his own wits,\\nbecoming old and young again—unless\\nsome god appeared and did it all with ease.\\nYou certainly were old just now, and wearing \\nthose dirty rags. Now you look like a god.”\\nArtful Odysseus said sharply, “No,\\nTelemachus, you should not be surprised\\nto see your father. It is me; no other\\nis on his way. I am Odysseus.\\nI suﬀered terribly, and I was lost,\\nbut after twenty years, I have come home.\\nAs for the way I look—Athena did it.\\nThe goddess can transform me as she likes;\\nsometimes a homeless beggar, then she makes me \\nlook like a young man, wearing princely clothes.\\nFor heavenly gods it is not diﬃcult\\nto make a mortal beautiful or ugly.”\\nWith that, he sat back down. Telemachus\\nhurled his arms round his father, and he wept.\\nThey both felt deep desire for lamentation,\\nand wailed with cries as shrill as birds, like eagles\\nor vultures, when the hunters have deprived them\\nof fledglings who have not yet learned to fly.\\nThat was how bitterly they wept. Their grieving \\nwould have continued till the sun went down,\\nbut suddenly Telemachus said,\\n“Father,\\nby what route did the sailors bring you here,\\nto Ithaca? And who were they? I know\\nyou did not walk.”\\nOdysseus replied,\\n“Son, I will tell you everything. Phaeacians,\\nfamous for navigation, brought me here.\\nThey always help their guests travel onward.\\nI slept as their ship sped across the ocean;\\nthey set me down on Ithaca, still sleeping. \\nThey brought me marvelous gifts of gold and bronze\\nand clothing, which are lying in a cave,\\nsince gods have willed it so. Athena told me\\nto come here and make plans with you to kill\\nour enemies. How many suitors are there?\\nWhat kind of men are they? I am well-known\\nfor my intelligence, and I will plot\\nto work out if we two alone can fight them,\\nor if we might need others helping us.”\\nTelemachus considered, then said, “Father, \\nI always heard how excellent you are,\\nat fighting with a spear, and making plans.\\nBut what you said just now—it is too much.\\nWe cannot fight, the two of us, against\\nsuch strong men, and so many—there are dozens,\\nnot just a handful. Let me tell you quickly\\nthe number of the suitors. Fifty-two\\ncame from Dulichium, all top-notch fighters,\\nwho brought six henchmen. Twenty-four men came\\nfrom Same, twenty more from Zacynthus, \\nand from right here on Ithaca came twelve,\\nall strong young men. They have a house boy with them,\\nnamed Medon, and a poet, and two slaves\\nwell trained in carving meat. If we attack\\nwhen all those men are crowded in the house,\\nI am afraid you will be paying back\\ntheir violence at all too high a price.\\nThink harder: can we find some kind of helper,\\nwilling to fight for us?”\\nOdysseus\\nsaid, “Do you think Athena and her father, \\nZeus, would be strong enough to keep us safe?\\nWould any other help be necessary?”\\nTelemachus replied, “The ones you mention\\nare good defenders. They sit high among\\nthe clouds, and they control both men and gods.”\\nThe veteran Odysseus replied,\\n“Those two will quickly join the heat of battle\\nwhen we begin to grapple with the suitors,\\nwhen in my house the god of war is testing\\nour fighting force and theirs. Go back at dawn, \\nand join those overconfident young men.\\nThe swineherd will escort me into town.\\nI will again be looking like a beggar.\\nIf they abuse me and you see me suﬀer,\\nyou must restrain yourself, repress your feelings,\\neven if they are pelting me with weapons,\\nand even if they grab me by the foot\\nto hurl me out. Just watch, and keep your temper.\\nPolitely tell them they should stop this folly.\\nThey will ignore you. Truly now their day \\nof doom is near at hand. Now listen hard.\\nAthena, my best co-conspirator,\\nwill nudge my heart, and I will nod to you.\\nThen you must find all weapons in the house\\nthat could be used for fighting; go and hide them\\naway inside the upstairs storage room.\\nAnd when the suitors ask where they have gone,\\nfob them oﬀ, saying, ‘They were near the fire,\\nso I removed them from the breath of smoke,\\nsince they were getting damaged; they were losing \\nthe luster that they used to have, before\\nOdysseus went oﬀ to Troy. Praise Zeus!\\nI thought of something even more important:\\nif you get drunk you may start quarreling,\\nand hurt each other. Then your lovely dinners\\nand courtship will be ruined. Arms themselves\\ncan prompt a man to use them.’ Tell them that.\\nLeave out two swords, two spears, and two thick shields\\nfor you and me to grab before we rush\\nto ambush them. Athena will bewitch them, \\nhelped by sharp-witted Zeus. And one more thing:\\nif you are my true son, of my own blood,\\nlet no one know that I am in the house.\\nLaertes and the swineherd must not know,\\nnor any of the slave girls, and not even\\nPenelope, until we have determined\\nthe women’s attitude. We also must\\ntest the male slaves, and see who has respect\\nand fears me in his heart, and who does not,\\nand who looks up to you as you deserve.” \\nHis glowing son said, “Father, you will see\\nmy courage in the moment. I am tough.\\nBut it would take too long to go around\\nand test each man like that, and all the while,\\nthe suitors would be sitting in your house,\\nwasting your wealth with heedless partying.\\nSo reconsider. I agree you should\\nfind out about the women—which of them\\nare innocent, and which dishonor you.\\nHowever, I have no desire to traipse \\naround to test the men; we can do that\\nlater, if Zeus reveals a sign to you.”\\nSuch was their conversation. Then the ship\\nin which Telemachus had gone to Pylos\\ndocked in the bay of Ithaca’s main town.\\nThey disembarked and dragged the ship onto shore.\\nThe slaves brought out the splendid gifts and weapons\\nand took them to the house of Clytius.\\nA messenger was sent to tell the queen\\nTelemachus was back in Ithaca, \\nand that he said that they must come to town,\\ndragging the ship, in case she had been weeping\\nin her anxiety about her son.\\nThe swineherd and this messenger met up,\\non the same mission, to inform the queen.\\nWhen both of them arrived, the slave girls clustered\\naround the messenger. He said,\\n“Great queen,\\nyour dear son has come home!”\\nAnd then the swineherd\\ntook her aside and told her what her son\\nhad ordered him to say. When he was done, \\nhe walked out through the hall and out the courtyard,\\nleaving the palace hall to join his pigs.\\nThe suitors were upset and down at heart.\\nEurymachus the son of Polybus\\nsaid, “Friends, the journey of this upstart boy\\nsucceeded! We were sure that he would fail.\\nWe must launch our best ship, equipped with rowers,\\nto speed across the ocean to the others\\nand tell them to come home at once.”\\nHis words\\nwere hardly finished when Amphinomus \\nspotted a ship inside the harbor, pointed\\naway from land; the sails were being furled,\\nthe men were carrying the oars. He laughed\\ntriumphantly and said,\\n“No need to send\\na messenger! They are already back!\\nSome god has told them, or they saw his ship\\napproaching, but could not catch up with it.”\\nSo leaping up, they went down to the seashore,\\nand dragged the black ship up onto dry land,\\nand servants proudly brought the weapons out. \\nThey all went crowding to the marketplace,\\ntogether, and banned any other men\\nfrom joining them, both young and old. And then\\nAntinous addressed them.\\n“How amazing!\\nThe gods have saved this man from death! For days\\nour scouts took turns to watch from windy cliﬀs.\\nAnd when the sun went down, we never spent\\na night on shore, but sailed to wait till Dawn\\nat sea in ambush for Telemachus,\\nto make sure we would catch him. Now some god \\nhas brought him home. We need to make new plans\\nto murder him. He must not get away.\\nHe will obstruct our courtship if he lives,\\nsince he is wise to us, and he will plot,\\nand now the people will be turned against us.\\nTelemachus will gather them; he must\\nbe furious, and he will not postpone\\naction. He will stand up and tell them how\\nwe planned to murder him, but failed to do so.\\nWhen they hear of our crimes, they will condemn us. \\nWe may get hurt or driven from our land,\\nto foreign territories; we must stop it!\\nCatch him out in the countryside, away\\nfrom town, or on the road. Let us rob him,\\nand share his wealth and property among us—\\nand let his mother, and whichever man\\nmarries her, keep the house. But if you think\\nit would be better if we let him live,\\nand keep his father’s riches for himself,\\nwe should stop flocking here to waste the wealth \\ninside his house. We should each go and court her\\nfrom home, by sending gifts. One day, the lady\\nwill marry, and the lucky man will be\\nthe one who sends the most gifts.”\\nThey were silent.\\nBut then Amphinomus, the famous son\\nof Nisus, spoke. He had come from the wheat fields\\nand pastures of Dulichium, with others.\\nHe was intelligent; Penelope\\npreferred his speeches over other men’s.\\nWisely he said,\\n“My friends, I for my part \\nhave no desire to kill Telemachus.\\nIt is a dreadful thing to kill a person\\nof royal blood. So first we must discover\\nthe gods’ intentions. If great Zeus decrees it,\\nI will kill him myself, and urge you all\\nto join me. If the gods do not approve,\\nI say we must not do it.”\\nSo he spoke,\\nand they agreed with what he said. They stood,\\nand went back to Odysseus’ house,\\nand sat on polished chairs.\\nPenelope \\ndecided she must show herself to these\\nungentlemanly suitors, since she had\\nfound out about the plot to kill her son—\\nMedon had heard their plans, and he told her.\\nHer women at her side, she went downstairs,\\ninto the hall, approached them and then stopped,\\nstanding beside the doorpost with a veil\\nacross her face. She told Antinous,\\n“You are a brute! A sneak! A criminal!\\nThe people say you are the smartest boy \\nof all those your own age on Ithaca.\\nIt is not true. You are insane! How could you\\ndevise a plan to kill Telemachus?\\nDo you have no respect for ties created\\nby supplication, which Zeus watches over?\\nHave you forgotten that your father came here,\\nrunning in terror from the Ithacans,\\nwho were enraged because he joined the pirates\\nof Taphos, and was hounding the Thesprotians,\\nour allies? So the Ithacans were eager \\nto kill him, rip his heart out, and devour\\nhis wealth. Odysseus protected him!\\nNow you consume your benefactor’s wealth,\\nand court his wife, and try to kill his son,\\nand you are hurting me! I tell you, stop!\\nAnd make the other suitors stop as well.”\\nHe said, “Penelope, you need not worry.\\nPut all this from your mind. There is no man\\nand never will be, who can harm your boy\\nwhile I am still alive upon this earth. \\nI swear to you, if someone tries, my sword\\nwill spill his blood! Your city-sacking husband\\noften would take me on his lap, and give me\\ntidbits of meat with his own hands, and sips\\nof red wine. So Telemachus is now\\nthe man I love the most in all the world.\\nThe boy is in no danger, not from us—\\nthere is no help for death brought by the gods.”\\nHe spoke to mollify her; all the while\\nhe was devising plans to kill her son. \\nShe went up to her light and airy bedroom,\\nand wept for dear Odysseus, her husband,\\nuntil Athena gave her eyes sweet sleep.\\nAs evening fell, the swineherd came back home\\nto find Odysseus. He and his son\\nhad killed a year-old pig and made a meal.\\nAthena came beside Odysseus\\nand touched him with her wand again to make him\\nragged and old, to make sure when the swineherd\\ncame in, he would not recognize his master, \\nin case he told Penelope the secret.\\nHe came inside. Telemachus spoke first.\\n“Eumaeus, you are back! What is the news\\nin town? Are those proud suitors in my house,\\nback from the ambush, or still lurking there\\nto catch me on my way back home?”\\nEumaeus\\nanswered, “I did not want to trek through town\\nasking that question. I preferred to share\\nmy news as fast as possible and then\\ncome back. One of your own men went with me, \\na messenger; he told your mother first.\\nI saw one more thing: as I passed the hill\\nof Hermes, right above the town I saw\\na ship draw into harbor, full of men\\nand loaded up with shields and spears. I thought\\nit could be them, but I cannot be sure.”\\nThen Prince Telemachus began to smile\\nand met his father’s eyes; he did not let\\nEumaeus see. When they were finished cooking,\\nthey shared the dinner equally, and all \\nhad plenty, then they took the gift of sleep.\\nBOOK \\nInsults and Abuse\\nWhen newborn Dawn appeared with hands of flowers,\\nTelemachus, Odysseus’ son,\\nfastened his handsome sandals on his feet,\\ntook up his sturdy spear that fit his hand,\\nand headed out. He told the swineherd,\\n“Grandpa,\\nI must go into town, to see my mother.\\nUntil we meet, I think she will not stop\\nher lamentations, tears, and bitter sobbing.\\nNow I need you to take this poor old stranger\\nto town to beg his supper; any man \\nwho feels like it can feed him. I cannot\\nput up with everyone right now; I have\\ntoo many worries. If he gets annoyed,\\nthe worse for him. I always like to tell\\nthe honest truth.”\\nOdysseus replied,\\n“My friend, I do not even want to stay.\\nBeggars should wander round the town and country.\\nI will get food from charitable people.\\nI am too old to stay here as a farmhand,\\nobeying orders from an overseer. \\nThis man will take me, as you told him to,\\nas soon as I have warmed up by the fire.\\nI only have these rags; the morning frost\\nmay do me in—you say the town is far.”\\nAt that, Telemachus strode quickly out,\\nthinking about his plan to hurt the suitors.\\nAnd when he reached the royal house, he propped\\nhis spear against a pillar, and went in,\\nacross the stony threshold.\\nEurycleia\\nthe nurse, was first to notice his arrival, \\nas she was laying fleeces on the chairs.\\nWeeping, she rushed at him. The other women\\nowned by strong-willed Odysseus assembled\\nand kissed Telemachus’ head and shoulders\\nto welcome him. Then wise Penelope\\ncame from her bedroom, looking like a goddess,\\nlike Artemis or golden Aphrodite,\\nand flung her arms around her darling son,\\nand wept. She kissed his face and shining eyes,\\nand through her tears her words flew out.\\n“You came! \\nTelemachus! Sweet light! I was so sure\\nthat I would never see you anymore\\nafter you sailed to Pylos secretly,\\nnot telling me, to get news of your father.\\nTell me, what have you seen?”\\nTelemachus\\nsaid calmly, “Mother, do not try to make me\\nupset, or stir my feelings. I survived\\nthe danger. Go upstairs and take your bath,\\nput on clean clothes and take your women with you\\ninto your bedroom. Sacrifice and pray \\nto all the gods, that one day Zeus may grant\\nrevenge. Now I am going into town.\\nI will invite the stranger who arrived\\nright after me on Ithaca. I sent him\\nahead, with my brave men, and told Piraeus\\nto take him home and treat him with all kindness\\nuntil I come.”\\nHis flying words hit home.\\nShe washed, put on clean clothes, and prayed to all\\nthe gods, and made them lavish sacrifices,\\nasking that one day Zeus would bring revenge. \\nTelemachus took up his spear and marched\\nout through the hall, two swift dogs at his side.\\nAthena poured unearthly grace upon him.\\nEveryone was amazed to see him coming.\\nThe suitors gathered round and spoke to him\\nin friendly tones; at heart, they meant him harm.\\nKeeping away from most of them, he joined\\nMentor and Antiphus and Halitherses,\\nwho were his father’s friends from long ago.\\nThey questioned him in detail. Then Piraeus \\napproached with Theoclymenus, the stranger\\nwhom he had brought through town towards the center.\\nAt once Telemachus set out and rushed\\nto stand beside the stranger. And Piraeus\\nspoke first.\\n“Telemachus, send women quickly\\nto my house, so I may give back the gifts\\nthat Menelaus gave you.”\\nBut with caution\\nTelemachus replied,\\n“Piraeus, no.\\nWe do not know exactly what will happen,\\nand if the suitors in my house by stealth \\nshould kill me and divide my father’s wealth\\nbetween themselves, I would prefer that you\\nenjoy the gifts than any of those men.\\nAnd if I kill them, planting doom among them,\\nbring me the gifts, and we will both be happy.”\\nWith this, he led the weary stranger back\\nto his house, where he laid their cloaks across\\nchairs; they went to bathe. The slave girls washed them,\\nrubbed them with oil, and dressed them in wool cloaks\\nand tunics. Then they left the baths and sat \\non chairs. A girl brought out a golden pitcher\\nand poured the washing water on their hands,\\nover a silver bowl. She set a table\\nbeside them, and a humble slave girl brought\\na generous array from their rich stores.\\nPenelope was leaning on a chair\\nbeside the door, facing Telemachus,\\nspinning fine strands of wool. They helped themselves\\nto food and drink. When they had had enough,\\nPenelope, preoccupied, spoke up. \\n“Telemachus, I will go upstairs now,\\nto lie down on my bed, which has become\\na bed of mourning, always stained with tears,\\nsince my Odysseus went oﬀ to Troy\\nwith those two sons of Atreus. But you\\nhave failed to tell me if you gathered news\\nabout your father’s journey home; now tell me,\\nbefore the suitors come.”\\nTelemachus\\nanswered her calmly. “Mother, I will tell you.\\nWe went to Pylos, visiting King Nestor. \\nHe made me very welcome in his palace,\\nunder his roof, as if I were his son\\nreturning after many years away.\\nHe cared for me like one of his own sons.\\nBut he said he had not heard anything\\nfrom anyone about Odysseus,\\nalive or dead. He sent me on, with horses\\nand carriage, to the son of Atreus,\\ngreat General Menelaus. There I saw\\nHelen for whose sake, by the will of gods, \\nthe Greeks and Trojans suﬀered through the war.\\nWhen Menelaus asked why I had come\\nto glorious Sparta, I told him the truth\\nin detail, and he answered, ‘Stupid cowards!\\nThe bed they want to lie down in belongs\\nto someone truly resolute. As when\\na deer lays down her newborn suckling fawns\\ninside the leafy den of some fierce lion,\\nand goes oﬀ to the slopes and grassy valleys\\nto graze. Then he comes back to his own bed \\nand cruelly destroys both little ones.\\nSo will Odysseus destroy them all.\\nBy Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo,\\nI pray he is as strong as long ago,\\non Lesbos, when he wrestled Philomedes\\nand hurled him to the ground, and all the Greeks\\ncheered. May he fight the suitors that same way,\\nso all of them will find their courtship ends\\nbadly, and their lives soon. And I will answer\\nyour questions frankly, and tell what I learned \\nfrom the old Sea God, who can tell no lies.\\nHe said he saw him in distress: the nymph\\nCalypso has him trapped upon her island,\\ninside her house. He cannot come back home\\nto his own country, since he has no fleet\\nor crew to row across the sea’s broad back.’\\nThat was what famous Menelaus said.\\nMy tasks accomplished, I sailed oﬀ. The gods\\ngave me fair wind which swiftly brought me home.”\\nHis story stirred emotions in her heart. \\nThen godlike Theoclymenus spoke up.\\n“My lady, wife of great Odysseus,\\nthis news is incomplete. I will reveal\\nthe whole truth with a prophecy. I swear\\nby Zeus and hospitality and by\\nthe hearth of great Odysseus, the place\\nwhere I have come: he is already here\\nin Ithaca—at rest or on his way.\\nHe must have learned what bad things they are doing,\\nand he is plotting ruin for them all. \\nI know because I saw a sign while sitting\\non board the ship—I told Telemachus.”\\nPenelope said carefully, “Well, stranger,\\nI hope this does come true. I would reward you\\nwith so much warmth and generosity\\nthat everyone you met would see your luck.”\\nMeanwhile, outside Odysseus’ house,\\nthe suitors relished games of darts and discus,\\nplaying outside as usual, with no thought\\nof others. Then at dinnertime, when flocks \\nof sheep were trekking home from every field,\\nled by their shepherds, Medon spoke. He was\\nthe suitors’ favorite slave boy, whom they always\\nbrought to their feasts.\\n“My lords, you have enjoyed\\nyour games. Now come inside to eat. There is\\nno harm in having meals at proper times.”\\nThey followed his advice, stood up and went\\ninside the palace. They spread out their cloaks\\nover the chairs, and killed plump goats, large rams,\\nsome fatted pigs, and one domestic cow, \\nand cooked them for the feast.\\nOdysseus\\nwas making haste to leave the countryside\\nfor town. The swineherd spoke in lordly tones.\\n“Stranger, my master says that you can come\\nto town today, as you desire—though I\\nwould rather leave you here to watch the farm.\\nBut I am nervous that the master may\\nreproach me, and a master’s curses fall\\nheavily on a slave. Now we must go.\\nThe hour is late and it will soon get colder; \\nthe sun is sinking low.”\\nOdysseus\\nanswered, “I understand. We can go now;\\nyou lead the way. But if you have a stick,\\ngive it to me to lean on, since I hear\\nthe path is slippery.”\\nWith that, he slung\\nhis bag across his shoulders by its string.\\nIt was all tattered, full of holes. Eumaeus\\ngave him a serviceable stick. They left;\\nthe dogs and herdsmen stayed to guard the farm.\\nThe swineherd led his master into town \\nresembling a poor old beggar, leaning\\nupon a stick and dressed in dirty rags.\\nThey walked along the stony path, and near\\nthe town, they reached an ornate fountain, flowing\\nwith clear streams, where the people came for water.\\nIt had been built by Ithacus, Neritus,\\nand Polyctor. A circle of black poplars\\ngrew round it, nurtured by the spring. Cool water\\npoured from the rocks above. There was an altar\\nbuilt over it in honor of the Nymphs. \\nAll passersby made oﬀerings to them.\\nMelanthius the son of Dolius,\\nwith two more herders, met them there. He was\\ndriving the finest goats to feed the suitors.\\nOn seeing them, he spoke abusively,\\nin brash, oﬀensive language that enraged\\nOdysseus.\\n“One scoundrel leads another!\\nMakes sense: gods join like things with like. You foul\\npig-man, where are you taking this old swine?\\nA scrounger, who will rub on many doors, \\ndemanding scraps, not gifts for warriors.\\nIf you let me have him to guard my farm,\\nand muck the pens and toss the kids their fodder,\\nhe could drink whey and fatten his stick legs.\\nBut he does not want work. He likes to traipse\\naround the town and beg for chow to stuﬀ\\nhis greedy belly. I predict, if he\\nreaches the palace of Odysseus,\\na mass of hands will hurl stools at his head,\\nto pelt him through the house and bruise his ribs.” \\nWith that, he sauntered past him, and lunged out\\nto kick him on the hip bone. What a fool!\\nOdysseus was not pushed oﬀ the path;\\nhe stood there fixed in place, and wondered whether\\nto rush at him, armed with his stick, and kill him,\\nor grab him by the ears and push him down\\nonto the ground. Instead, he braced himself\\nand kept his temper. When the swineherd saw\\nMelanthius insulting him, he prayed,\\narms high.\\n“O Fountain Nymphs, O Zeus’ daughters! \\nIf ever King Odysseus brought bones\\nof lamb and goat in luscious fat for you, then now\\nfulfill my prayer! May spirits guide him home!\\nMy master will put paid to all the bluster\\nof this rude man, who loafs round town and lets\\nthe animals be ruined by bad herders.”\\nMelanthius the goatherd sneered at him,\\n“Oh, very nice! This dog knows how to talk,\\nand it has learned some tricks. One day I will\\ntake him by ship and row him far away \\nfrom Ithaca, and get a heap of treasure\\nby selling him. I wish Apollo would\\nshoot silver arrows at Telemachus\\ntomorrow in his house; or that the suitors\\nwould kill him. I am sure Odysseus\\nis far away and never coming back.”\\nWith that, he left them—they were walking slowly,\\nand he rushed on ahead of them. He went\\ninside his master’s house, and sat among\\nthe suitors, with Eurymachus, his favorite. \\nThe slaves brought out a piece of meat for him,\\nand a submissive house girl brought him bread.\\nThe swineherd and Odysseus went in,\\nand stood, surrounded by the strumming sound\\nof the resounding lyre that Phemius\\nwas tuning for his song. Odysseus\\ngrabbed at the swineherd’s hand and said,\\n“Eumaeus!\\nThis is Odysseus’ splendid palace.\\nIt could be recognized among a thousand.\\nThe rooms are all connected, and the courtyard \\nis fenced in by a wall with cornices,\\nand there are sturdy double doors. No man\\ncould break through here. I notice many men\\nare feasting; I smell meat, and hear the lyre,\\nwhich gods have made companion to the feast.”\\nEumaeus answered, “Right! You are perceptive.\\nNow we must plan. Will you go inside first\\nto join the suitors, while I stay out here?\\nOr do you want to wait, and I will go?\\nBut do not stay too long. If someone sees you, \\nyou will be pelted, maybe beaten up.”\\nUnflappable Odysseus said, “Yes,\\nI thought of that. You go, I will stay here.\\nI have been hit before. I know hard knocks.\\nI am resilient. I suﬀered war\\nand being lost at sea. So let this be.\\nThere is no way to hide a hungry belly.\\nIt is insistent, and the curse of hunger\\nis why we sail across relentless seas,\\nand plunder other people.”\\nAs they spoke, \\nArgos, the dog that lay there, raised his head\\nand ears. Odysseus had trained this dog\\nbut with no benefit—he left too soon\\nto march on holy Troy. The master gone,\\nboys took the puppy out to hunt wild goats\\nand deer and hares. But now he lay neglected,\\nwithout an owner, in a pile of dung\\nfrom mules and cows—the slaves stored heaps of it\\noutside the door, until they fertilized\\nthe large estate. So Argos lay there dirty, \\ncovered with fleas. And when he realized\\nOdysseus was near, he wagged his tail,\\nand both his ears dropped back. He was too weak\\nto move towards his master. At a distance,\\nOdysseus had noticed, and he wiped\\nhis tears away and hid them easily,\\nand said,\\n“Eumaeus, it is strange this dog\\nis lying in the dung; he looks quite handsome,\\nthough it is hard to tell if he can run,\\nor if he is a pet, a table dog, \\nkept just for looks.”\\nEumaeus, you replied,\\n“This dog belonged to someone who has died\\nin foreign lands. If he were in good health,\\nas when Odysseus abandoned him\\nand went to Troy, you soon would see how quick\\nand brave he used to be. He went to hunt\\nin woodland, and he always caught his prey.\\nHis nose was marvelous. But now he is\\nin bad condition, with his master gone,\\nlong dead. The women fail to care for him. \\nSlaves do not want to do their proper work,\\nwhen masters are not watching them. Zeus halves\\nour value on the day that makes us slaves.”\\nWith that, the swineherd went inside the palace,\\nto join the noble suitors. Twenty years\\nhad passed since Argos saw Odysseus,\\nand now he saw him for the final time—\\nthen suddenly, black death took hold of him.\\nTelemachus first saw the swineherd coming.\\nHe gave a nod to tell him to come over. \\nGlancing around, Eumaeus saw the stool\\nused by the boy who carved the suitors’ meat.\\nHe picked it up and set it down beside\\nTelemachus’ table. There he sat;\\nthe slave boy brought him meat and bread. And then\\nOdysseus approached and stepped inside,\\nlooking like some poor homeless sad old man;\\nhe hobbled on his stick, then slumped himself\\ndown on the ash-wood threshold, leaning back\\nagainst the cypress doorpost, which a workman \\nhad smoothed and straightened long ago. The boy\\nsummoned the swineherd over, and picked up\\na wheat loaf from the basket and as much\\nmeat as his hands could hold, and gave it to him.\\nHe said,\\n“Please take this food out to that stranger,\\nand tell him he should walk around the hall\\nand beg from all the suitors; shame is not\\na friend to those in need.”\\nThe swineherd went\\nand told Odysseus, “Telemachus\\ngives you this food and says you ought to beg \\nfrom all these suitors; shame, he says, is not\\nfitting for those who have to live by handouts.”\\nOdysseus prayed cautiously, “O Zeus,\\nbless this Telemachus, and may he have\\nall that his heart desires.”\\nAnd with both hands\\nhe took the food and set it at his feet,\\non top of his old ragged bag, and ate,\\nand listened to the singer in the hall.\\nAs he was finishing, the music stopped;\\nthe suitors shouted, and Athena stood \\nbeside Odysseus, and prompted him\\nto go among the suitors, begging scraps,\\nto find out which of them were bad or good—\\nalthough she had no thought of saving any\\nout of the massacre which was to come.\\nHe went around and begged from left to right,\\nholding his hand out, like a practiced beggar.\\nThey gave him food in pity, and they wondered\\nwho this man was and whereabouts he came from.\\nThey asked each other, and Melanthius, \\nthe goatherd, said,\\n“You suitors of the queen,\\nlisten to me about this stranger here.\\nI saw this man before; the swineherd brought him.\\nI know no more; I do not know his background.”\\nAntinous began to scold the swineherd.\\n“Pig-man! You famous idiot! Why did you\\nbring this man here? Do we not have already\\nplenty of homeless people coming here\\nto spoil our feasts? Is it not bad enough\\nthat they crowd round and eat your master’s wealth? \\nYou had to ask this other one as well?”\\nEumaeus, you replied, “Antinous,\\nyou are a lord, but what you say is trash.\\nWho would invite a stranger from abroad\\nunless he had the skills to help the people—\\na prophet, or a doctor, or a builder,\\nor poet who can sing and bring delight?\\nNo one would ask a beggar; they bring only\\ntheir hunger. Out of all the suitors, you\\nare meanest to the slaves, especially me. \\nBut if the prudent queen and godlike prince\\nstill live here in this house, I do not mind.”\\nTelemachus said, “Shush. Antinous\\ndoes not deserve an answer. He is always\\npicking a fight, and goading on the others.”\\nThen turning to Antinous, he said,\\n“You care for me so nicely, like a father!\\nYou told me I should force the stranger out.\\nMay no god make that happen! Go to him\\nand give him something; I can spare the food. \\nGo on, I tell you! You should pay no heed\\nto Mother or the other household slaves\\nbelonging to my father. You were not\\nconcerned about them anyway. You want\\nto gorge yourself, not share with other people.”\\nAntinous replied, “You little show-oﬀ!\\nWhat nasty temper! What an awful comment!\\nIf all the suitors gave the same as me,\\nthis house could keep him checked for three whole\\nmonths.”\\nHe had a footstool underneath the table, \\nfor resting his soft feet on while he feasted;\\nhe brandished it. The others all gave food\\nand filled the beggar’s bag. Odysseus\\nhad finished with his test; he could have walked\\nback to the threshold, no harm done. Instead,\\nhe stood beside Antinous and said,\\n“Friend, give me something. You must be the best\\nof all the Greeks. You look like royalty,\\nso you should give more food than all the rest,\\nand I will make you known throughout the world. \\nI used to be a rich man, with a palace.\\nWhen needy beggars came from anywhere,\\nno matter who they were, I gave them food.\\nMy slaves were numberless, my wealth was great;\\nI had the life men say is happiness.\\nBut Zeus destroyed it all; he wanted to.\\nHe prompted me to travel with some pirates\\nto Egypt; that long journey spelled my ruin.\\nI moored my galleys in the River Nile\\nand told my loyal men to stay and guard them, \\nand sent out scouts to all the lookout points.\\nBut they were too impulsive, and they sacked\\nthe beautiful Egyptian fields, and seized\\nwomen and children, and they killed the men.\\nThe screaming reached the town; the people heard,\\nand rushed to come and help; at dawn the plain\\nwas all filled up with foot soldiers and horses\\nand flashing bronze. Then Zeus, who loves the thunder,\\ncaused panic in my men—disastrous panic.\\nDanger was all around us, and not one \\nstood firm. The sharp bronze swords killed many men,\\nand others were enslaved as laborers.\\nBut they gave me to somebody they met,\\na foreigner named Dmetor, king of Cyprus.\\nI came from there. Such is my tale of woe.”\\nAntinous replied, “What god imposed\\nthis pest to spoil our feast? Stay over there,\\nnot near my table—or you can get lost!\\nGet killed in Egypt or enslaved in Cyprus!\\nYou barefaced beggar! You come up to us, \\nand these men give you treats unthinkingly;\\nwe have so much, and people do not mind\\nsharing another person’s wealth.”\\nSharp-witted\\nOdysseus drew back from him and said,\\n“You handsome idiot! You would not give\\na grain of salt from your own house. You sit\\nenjoying someone else’s food, and yet\\nyou will not give a crumb from this great banquet\\nto me.”\\nAntinous was furious,\\nand scowling said, “That does it! You insult me? \\nYou lost the chance to leave with dignity!”\\nHe lifted up his stool and hurled it at\\nOdysseus’ right shoulder, near his back.\\nIt did not knock him over; like a rock\\nhe stood there, shook his head, and silently\\nconsidered his revenge. Then he went back,\\nsat on the threshold and set down the bag,\\nall full of food, and told them, “Listen, suitors\\nof this world-famous queen; I have to speak.\\nWhen men are fighting for their own possessions, \\nfor cows or sheep, there is no shame in wounds.\\nBut now Antinous has wounded me\\nbecause I came here hungry; hunger brings\\nsuch suﬀering to humans. If there are\\ngods of the poor, or Furies to avenge us,\\nmay he be struck by death, instead of marriage!\\nHe answered, “Stranger, shut up, or be oﬀ!\\nIf you keep talking, we young men will drag you\\nacross the palace by your hands and feet\\nand have you flayed alive!”\\nBut all the others \\nreproached Antinous insistently.\\n“You ought not to have hit a poor old beggar!\\nIf he turns out to be a god from heaven\\nit will end badly! Gods disguise themselves\\nas foreigners and strangers to a town,\\nto see who violates their holy laws,\\nand who is good.”\\nAntinous ignored\\nthe suitors’ words. The blow increased the pain\\ninside Telemachus’ heart, but he\\nlet fall no tears. He calmly shook his head \\nand thought about revenge.\\nPenelope\\nheard what had happened in the hall, and said\\nto all her slaves,\\n“I hope Apollo shoots\\nAntinous, just as he hit the beggar!”\\nAnd old Eurynome replied, “If only\\nour prayers were answered! None of them would live\\nto see the Dawn ride in upon her throne.”\\nPenelope said, “Yes, dear, they are all\\nour enemies and mean to do us harm.\\nAntinous is the worst; he is like death. \\nSome poor old stranger wandered to this house\\nand asked the men for food, compelled by need.\\nThe others helped him out and filled his bag;\\nAntinous hurled a footstool at his shoulder.”\\nShe had this conversation in her room\\nwith her attendants, while Odysseus\\nwas eating dinner. Then she called the swineherd.\\n“Eumaeus! Have the stranger come to me,\\nso I may welcome him, and ask if he\\nhas heard or witnessed anything about \\nlong-lost Odysseus. The stranger seems\\nas if he must have traveled far.”\\nEumaeus\\nreplied, “Your Majesty, I wish these men\\nwould quiet down! The tales the stranger tells\\nwould charm your heart. For three days and three nights\\nI had him stay with me. He ran away\\nfrom oﬀ a ship, and came to my house first;\\nhe started to describe his suﬀerings,\\nand had not finished. Like a singer, blessed\\nby gods with skill in storytelling—people \\nwatch him and hope that he will sing forever—\\nso this man’s tale enchanted me. He says\\nOdysseus and he are old guest-friends\\nthrough their forefathers. This man lived in Crete,\\nthe home of Minos, and he traveled here\\na rambling route, with dangers compassed round.\\nHe says Odysseus is still alive\\nand near here, in the rich Thesprotian land,\\nand he is bringing home a pile of treasure.”\\nPenelope said, “Call him over, let him \\ntell me in person, while the suitors have\\ntheir fun here in my house or at the doors;\\ntheir mood is festive. In their homes they have\\nuntasted food and wine, which their house slaves\\ndevour, while they are flocking to our house\\neach day to slaughter oxen, sheep, and goats,\\nto feast and drink our wine, with no restraint.\\nOur wealth is decimated. There is no man\\nhere like Odysseus, who could defend\\nthe house. But if Odysseus comes back \\nto his own native land, he and his son\\nwill soon take vengeance for their violence.”\\nTelemachus sneezed loudly and the noise\\nresounded through the hall. Penelope\\nlaughed, and she told Eumaeus,\\n“Call the stranger!\\nMy son just sneezed at what I said—you heard?\\nIt is a sign of death for all the suitors;\\nno one can save them from their ruin now.\\nBut listen: if I find this stranger speaking\\nthe truth, give him nice clothes—a cloak and tunic.” \\nAt that, the swineherd went and stood beside\\nOdysseus. His words had wings.\\n“Now sir,\\nPenelope, Telemachus’ mother,\\nhas summoned you. She feels impelled to ask\\nabout her husband, painful though it is.\\nIf you tell her the truth—and she will know—\\nyou will get clothes; you desperately need them.\\nAnd you can ask for food all through the town,\\nand fill your belly. Anyone who wants\\ncan give you scraps.”\\nStrong-willed Odysseus \\nanswered, “Eumaeus, I will tell the truth,\\nthe whole truth, to Penelope, and soon.\\nI know about Odysseus; we shared\\nin suﬀering. But I am very nervous\\nabout the rowdy suitors. Their aggression\\ntouches the iron sky. When I was walking\\nacross the hall just now, quite harmlessly,\\nthat man hurled something at me, and he hurt me.\\nTelemachus did nothing to protect me,\\nand nor did anybody else. So now, \\ntell her to stay right there until night falls,\\nhowever eager she may be. At dusk,\\nshe can come nearer, sit beside the fire,\\nand ask about her husband’s journey home.\\nI do have dirty clothes—you know it well,\\nsince it was you I came to first for help.”\\nThe swineherd headed back; he crossed the threshold,\\nand sharp Penelope said,\\n“Are you not\\nbringing the traveler? Is something wrong?\\nIs he too scared or shy? A homeless man \\ncan ill aﬀord such shame.”\\nEumaeus answered,\\n“His words were common sense; he wants to stay\\nout of the suitors’ way; they are aggressive.\\nHe says you should stay here until sunset.\\nIt is much better for you too, my queen,\\nto speak to him alone.”\\nPenelope\\nreplied, “The stranger is no fool at least.\\nThere never were such bullies as these men,\\nand they intend us harm.”\\nThe swineherd went\\nback to the crowd of suitors, and approached \\nTelemachus, and tucked his head down close,\\nso no one else would hear. “My friend,” he said,\\n“I have to go and watch the pigs, and all\\nyour property, and mine. You should take care\\nof everything, but most of all, yourself.\\nDo not get hurt. So many mean you harm.\\nI pray that Zeus obliterates them all,\\nbefore they injure us!”\\nTelemachus\\nanswered, “May it be so. First eat, then go;\\ncome back at dawn with animals for meat. \\nThe rest is up to me and up to gods.”\\nSo then Eumaeus sat down on the stool,\\nand ate and drank, then went back to his pigs,\\nleaving the palace full of banqueters.\\nIt was already late, past afternoon;\\nmusic and dancing entertained the suitors.\\nBOOK \\nTwo Beggars\\nThen came a man who begged throughout the town\\nof Ithaca, notorious for greed.\\nHe ate and drank nonstop, so he was fat\\nbut weak, with no capacity for fighting.\\nThe name his mother gave him as a child\\nwas Arnaeus, but all the young men called him\\nIrus, because he was their messenger.\\nNow this man tried to chase Odysseus\\nfrom his own home, and cursed him.\\n“Get away,\\nold man! Get out! Or else you will be dragged \\nout by the foot! Do you not see the suitors\\nwinking to tell me I must throw you out?\\nThis is embarrassing for me; I must\\nmake you get up right now! Or we must fight!”\\nScowling at him, Odysseus said, “Fool!\\nI did not do you wrong or speak against you.\\nI am not jealous of another beggar\\nreceiving gifts, however much he gets.\\nThis doorway can accommodate us both.\\nDo not hog all the wealth; it is not yours. \\nYou seem to be a homeless man, like me.\\nGods give all mortal blessings. Do not stir me\\nto fight or lose my temper. I am old\\nbut I will crack your ribs and smash your face\\nto bloody pulp—then I will have a day\\nof peace tomorrow; you will not return\\nhere to the palace of Odysseus.”\\nIrus the vagabond was furious.\\n“This greedy pig yaks on like some old woman\\nscrubbing an oven! I will hurt him, punch him \\ntwo-fisted, and rip out his teeth, as farmers\\npull out the tusks from pigs that damage crops.\\nGet ready! Let them watch. How could you be\\nso dumb, to pick a fight with someone younger?”\\nSo on the threshold at the palace doors\\ntheir furious aggression reached its peak.\\nAntinous, that saintly lord, incited\\nthe fight and with a chuckle told the suitors,\\n“My friends! We never had so fine a show\\nbrought to this house before. The gods be thanked, \\nthese two are getting ready for a brawl.\\nQuick, let us goad them on!”\\nThey all jumped up,\\nlaughing, and gathered round the ragged beggars.\\nAntinous addressed them.\\n“Listen, suitors!\\nGoat stomachs stuﬀed with fat and blood are roasting\\nover the fire for dinner. Let the beggar\\nwho wins the fight choose one of these and take it;\\nand he can always eat with us in future,\\nand we will let no other beggar come\\nto share our company.”\\nThey all agreed. \\nThe strategist Odysseus deceived them,\\nsaying, “My friends, there is no way a man\\nas old as me, worn down by suﬀering,\\ncan fight a younger man. My hunger forces\\nbad choices, tempting me to take the beating.\\nBut swear a mighty oath that none of you\\nwill step up to help Irus out and hit me\\nroughly with fists and make me lose to him.”\\nAll of them swore the oath as he had asked.\\nThe holy prince Telemachus said,\\n“Guest, \\nif your brave spirit urges you to fight\\nagainst this challenger, you need not worry\\nabout the others. Anyone who strikes you\\nwill face a multitude. I am your host;\\nEurymachus and this Antinous\\nare sensible and they agree with me.”\\nThey all consented, and Odysseus\\ntook oﬀ his rags and tied them round his waist,\\nrevealing massive thighs and mighty shoulders,\\nenormous chest and sturdy arms. Athena \\nstood near him and increased his strength, to suit\\nthe shepherd of the people. All the suitors\\nwere flabbergasted, and they said,\\n“This means\\nthe end of Irus—brought upon himself!\\nWhat muscles underneath the old man’s rags!”\\nIrus was deeply troubled and afraid;\\nhis heart sank. But the house slaves made him gird\\nhis tunic and get ready. He was shaking.\\nAntinous said,\\n“Haha, you big show-oﬀ!\\nYou would be better dead than so afraid \\nof some old man worn down by suﬀering.\\nIf this man beats you, proving he is stronger,\\nI will toss you on board a ship and send you\\noﬀ to King Echetus in mainland Greece,\\nthe lord of cruelty and pain. He will\\ncut oﬀ your nose and ears with pitiless bronze,\\nand then your genitals, and he will give them\\nraw to his dogs to eat.”\\nThese words increased\\nhis shakiness. Escorted to the ring,\\nhe stood. Both raised their fists. Odysseus, \\nwho had endured so many insults, wondered\\nif he should hit him hard enough to kill him,\\nor give him just a tap to knock him down.\\nA light touch would be best, he thought, in case\\nthe suitors cottoned on. They came to blows.\\nFirst Irus hit Odysseus’ shoulder;\\nOdysseus punched Irus on his neck\\nbelow the ear, and broke his jaw. Red blood\\ngushed from his mouth, and with a moan he fell,\\nteeth chattering, legs flailing. Then the suitors \\nthrew up their hands to cheer, and died of laughter.\\nOdysseus seized Irus by the foot,\\ndragging him through the gateway to the courtyard,\\nand propped him by the wall. He put a staﬀ\\ninto his hand, and said,\\n“Sit there and keep\\nthe dogs and pigs away! You good-for-nothing!\\nYou must not bully visitors and beggars,\\nor you will suﬀer even worse than this!”\\nThen picking up his ragged bag, he slung it\\nacross his shoulders by the strap and sat \\nbeside the door again. The suitors went\\ninside and raised their cups.\\n“May all the gods\\nand Zeus give you your heart’s desire! That Irus\\nwas sponging everywhere, the greedy pig.\\nYou put a stop to him, and we will send him\\nto Echetus, the king of mass destruction.”\\nOdysseus was thrilled to hear this omen.\\nAntinous set out the big goat’s stomach,\\nstuﬀed full of blood and fat, in front of him.\\nAmphinomus provided two bread baskets, \\nand a gold cup of wine, and welcomed him.\\n“Sir, be our guest, and may your future luck\\nbe good, though now you have so many troubles.”\\nOdysseus replied, his wits about him,\\n“Amphinomus, you seem intelligent,\\nlike Nisus of Dulichium, your father;\\nI heard about his wealth and excellence,\\nand that you are his son. You are well-spoken.\\nTake note of what I say. Of all the creatures\\nthat live and breathe and creep on earth, we humans \\nare weakest. When the gods bestow on us\\ngood fortune, and our legs are spry and limber,\\nwe think that nothing can ever can go wrong;\\nbut when the gods bring misery and pain,\\nwe have to bear our suﬀering with calm.\\nOur mood depends on what Zeus sends each day.\\nI once had what most people count as wealth,\\ngreat riches. I committed many crimes,\\nof violence, abuses of my power,\\nabetted by my brothers and my father. \\nNo one should turn away from what is right;\\na man should quietly accept whatever\\nthe gods may give. I see how wickedly\\nthe suitors are behaving—wasting wealth\\nand failing to respect the wife of one\\nwho soon will come back to his family\\nand homeland. Very soon! May spirits guide you\\nhome, so you do not meet him when he comes.\\nWhen he confronts the suitors in this hall\\nthere will be blood.”\\nHe poured an oﬀering \\nof sweet wine to the gods, and took a sip,\\nthen passed the cup back to Amphinomus,\\nwho took it, and then paced around the house,\\ntroubled at heart, his head bowed low; he saw\\nthe danger in his mind. But he was not\\nfated to live; Athena had condemned him\\nto be defeated by Telemachus\\nwith his strong spear. Amphinomus sat down\\non the same chair that he sat on before.\\nAthena, with her gray eyes glinting, gave \\nthoughtful Penelope a new idea:\\nto let the suitors see her, so desire\\nwould open up inside them like a sail,\\nand so her son and husband would respect her.\\nMysteriously, she laughed, and told her slave,\\n“Eurynome, I have a new desire:\\nto let the suitors see me, though I hate them.\\nI also want to give my son advice:\\nnot to spend so much time with those proud men.\\nThey talk impressively, but their intentions \\nare bad.”\\nEurynome replied, “My child,\\nyour words make sense. But you should wash and oil\\nyour skin, not go with blotches on your face\\nto have this conversation with your son.\\nYou should not grieve forever, and your boy\\nis older now. You always begged the gods\\nto let you see him grown up, with a beard.”\\nPenelope replied with circumspection,\\n“Eurynome, I know you care for me,\\nbut do not tell me I should wash myself \\nand put on oil. The gods destroyed my beauty\\nthat day my husband left in hollow ships.\\nGo call my slave girls, Hippodameia\\nand Autonoe—they must come with me\\ninto the hall. I do not want to go\\nto meet the men alone. It would be shameful.”\\nSo the old woman went and called the girls.\\nAthena’s eyes were bright with plans. She poured\\nsweet sleep onto Penelope, who lay\\ndown on her couch; her joints relaxed; she slept. \\nAthena gave her gifts of godlike power,\\nto make the men astonished when they saw her.\\nShe put ambrosial beauty on her face,\\nthe kind that Aphrodite, wreathed in myrtle,\\nuses before she dances with the Graces.\\nShe also made her shapelier and taller,\\nand made her skin more white than ivory.\\nThe goddess left. The girls came in; their talking\\nwoke up the queen. She felt her cheeks and said,\\n“Despite my bitter grief, a peaceful sleep \\nenveloped me. If only Artemis\\nwould bring me gentle death right now to end\\nmy misery. I waste my life in longing\\nfor my beloved husband, who was good\\nat everything—the best of the Achaeans.”\\nShe went down from her sunny room upstairs.\\nThe two slaves went with her. She reached the suitors,\\nand stood beside the central pillar, holding\\nher gauzy veil before her face. Her two\\ntrustworthy slaves stood either side of her. \\nThe suitors weakened at the knees; desire\\nbewitched them, and they longed to lie with her.\\nShe spoke to her dear son, Telemachus.\\n“Telemachus, you are not thinking straight.\\nWhen you were still a child, you had good sense.\\nNow you are bigger; you have reached adulthood.\\nYou are so tall and so good-looking now!\\nPeople can see you are a rich man’s son;\\neven a foreigner would know at once.\\nAnd yet your judgment is askew. What happened, \\nthat you allowed a guest to be insulted?\\nIf strangers in our house are so abused,\\nwhat then? You will be shamed! Your reputation\\nwill be destroyed!”\\nTelemachus replied\\nwith calculated purpose. “Mother, I do not\\nblame you for being angry. In my heart\\nI do know right and wrong. I used to be\\na child; I am not now. But I cannot\\neven aﬀord to think my own heart’s thoughts.\\nThose evil suitors keep distracting me, \\nand I have no one on my side. This fight\\nbetween the stranger and that beggar Irus\\ndid not turn out as they had wished; the stranger\\nwas much the stronger. Father Zeus! Apollo!\\nAthena! May the suitors in our house\\nbe beaten and bow down their heads, some in\\nthe house, and some outside. May each man’s body\\ngrow weak—like Irus, out there at the gate,\\nsitting with head slumped down, as if he were\\nintoxicated; he cannot stand up \\nnor go back home. His body is too frail.”\\nAnd then Eurymachus spoke up and said,\\n“O Queen Penelope! Wise, prudent daughter\\nof great Icarius! If all the Greeks\\ncould see you now, there would be far more suitors\\nfeasting here in your house, from dawn to dusk,\\nbecause no other woman equals you\\nin beauty, stature, and well-balanced mind.”\\nPenelope replied with caution. “No,\\nthe deathless gods destroyed my looks that day \\nthe Greeks embarked for Troy, and my own husband\\nOdysseus went with them. If he came\\nand started taking care of me again,\\nI would regain my good name and my beauty.\\nI am weighed down by grief. A spirit set\\nso many troubles on me. At the time\\nthat he left Ithaca, my husband grabbed\\nmy wrist, took my right hand, and said to me,\\n‘Now wife, I do not think we armored Greeks\\nwill all come home unharmed from Troy. They say \\nthe Trojans are good warriors with arrows\\nand javelins, and they ride chariots\\ndrawn by swift horses, which can quickly turn\\nthe tide of war, in which so many die.\\nSome god may bring me home, or I may be\\ncaptured out there in Troy. I do not know.\\nYou must remember this: my parents need\\nto be well cared for in our house, as much\\nas now or more so with me gone away.\\nWhen our son’s beard has grown, you must get married\\n\\nto any man you choose, and leave your house.’\\nThose were my husband’s words. The time has come;\\nthe night when I must marry is at hand.\\nTerrible! I am cursed! Zeus took away\\nmy happiness. Another bitter thought\\noppresses me: it is not right or proper\\nto court a decent woman in this way,\\na rich man’s wife, competing for her hand.\\nThey ought to bring fat sheep and cows to feed\\nmy family, and give fine gifts, not eat \\nwhat is not theirs, and oﬀer nothing back.”\\nOdysseus, who had endured so much,\\nwas happy she was secretly procuring\\npresents, and charming them with pretty words,\\nwhile her mind moved elsewhere.\\nAntinous\\nsaid, “Wise Penelope, take all the presents\\nthat any of the Greeks would like to bring.\\nRefusing gifts is not polite. But we\\nwill not go back to our own farms or elsewhere,\\nuntil you choose the best of us to marry.” \\nThey all agreed and sent their men for gifts.\\nAntinous brought out a splendid robe,\\nembroidered, with twelve brooches of pure gold\\npinned to the fabric. And Eurymachus\\ngave her a necklace, finely worked in gold\\nset in with amber beads that shone like sunlight.\\nTwo slaves brought earrings from Eurydamas.\\nThey sparkled beautifully, and triple clusters\\nlike berries hung from each. Pisander’s slave\\nbrought her a lovely choker, finely made. \\nAll of the suitors gave her diﬀerent gifts.\\nThe queen went upstairs to her room; her slaves\\ncarried the splendid presents. Then the suitors\\nturned back to watch the dancing and enjoy\\nthe captivating music. They stayed there\\nin pleasure, till black evening came. They set\\nthree braziers to light the whole great hall,\\nstuﬀed with dry wood, well seasoned and fresh cut,\\ncombined with kindling. The slave girls owned\\nby firm Odysseus took turns to light them. \\nThe king himself had all his wits about him,\\nand said,\\n“Slave girls! Odysseus, your master,\\nhas been long gone. Go back and sit beside\\nthe queen and comfort her. Spin yarn or comb\\nthe wool. I can provide these men with light.\\nIf they decide to stay here till bright Dawn\\nrides on her lovely throne, I will not be\\ndefeated. I am tough.”\\nAt that, the girls\\nbegan to giggle, peeking at each other.\\nPretty Melantho, child of Dolius, \\nhad been brought up by Queen Penelope,\\nwho gave her toys and treated her just like\\na daughter. But Melantho, unconcerned\\nabout Penelope, was sleeping with\\nEurymachus. She started to insult\\nOdysseus, and taunt him.\\n“Poor old stranger!\\nYou are insane! You did not want to sleep\\nout in the smithy or the public shelter;\\ninstead, you come here talking high and mighty\\namong this crowd of men. Are you not scared? \\nWine may have dulled your senses, or perhaps\\nyou always say such idiotic things.\\nHas your defeat of Irus made you crazy?\\nThat beggar? Then watch out, a better man\\nmay fight you soon, and punch your face so hard\\nyou will be kicked out of this house all drenched\\nin blood.”\\nOdysseus scowled back and said,\\n“You little dog! I will soon go and tell\\nTelemachus what you have said, so he\\ncan slice you limb from limb!”\\nThat made the women \\ntremble with fear; they thought he spoke the truth.\\nThey scattered through the house. He took his stand\\nbeside the braziers to keep them lit,\\nand looked at all the suitors. In his heart\\nhe formed his plans, which soon would be fulfilled.\\nAthena wanted pain to sink down deep\\ninside Odysseus. She made the suitors\\nkeep taunting him. Eurymachus was jeering\\nto make the others laugh.\\n“Now listen, suitors!\\nI have an intuition that this man \\nhas come into Odysseus’ house\\nthrough some god’s will. His head is shining brightly\\nunder the lanterns’ light—perhaps because\\nhe is completely bald!”\\nAnd then he turned\\nand asked Odysseus, the city-sacker,\\n“Stranger, if I was hiring, would you like\\nto labor on a distant farm for me?\\nYou would be paid for sure, if you could plant\\ntall trees, and build stone walls, and I would give you\\nyour meals all year and clothes, including footwear. \\nBut you are only skilled at wickedness.\\nYou have no wish to work. You like to beg,\\ntraipsing around to stuﬀ your greedy belly.”\\nCrafty Odysseus said, “How I wish,\\nEurymachus, that we could have a contest\\nin springtime in the meadow, when the days\\nare growing longer; I would have a scythe\\nof perfect curvature and so would you.\\nThe grass would be abundant; we would test\\nour skill by working all day long, not eating \\nuntil late evening. Or if we could plow\\nusing a pair of fine and well-fed oxen,\\nstrong and both equal in their power to pull,\\nand if we had four acres of good soil,\\nthen you would see if I know how to cut\\na furrow straight. Or if Zeus suddenly\\nmade war begin tomorrow, and I had\\ntwo spears, a shield, and a helmet all of bronze\\nclose-fitted to my head, you would see me\\namid the throng of fighters at the front— \\nand you would not hurl insults at my belly.\\nYou act aggressive, and you think you are\\na big strong man, because you spend your time\\namong this tiny group of lowborn louts.\\nBut if Odysseus appeared, the doors—\\nwhich are quite wide—would start to seem too narrow,\\nas you were struggling to get away.”\\nScowling with rage, Eurymachus replied,\\n“You nasty hobo! I will make you pay\\nfor showing oﬀ in front of all of us. \\nYou should be scared! The wine has made you stupid,\\nor maybe you are always talking nonsense;\\nor you are all puﬀed up from having won\\nover the beggar Irus!”\\nThen he hurled\\na footstool at Odysseus, who ducked\\nbehind Amphinomus in fear; it hit\\nthe right hand of the slave boy serving wine;\\nthe wine jug fell and clattered on the ground.\\nThe boy fell backwards on the dust and moaned.\\nThe suitors’ shouts resounded through the shadows: \\n“Too bad this foreign drifter did not die\\nbefore he came here causing all this bother!\\nThese arguments with beggars are disrupting\\nour banquet; it is spoiling our nice evening.\\nThis silly fuss is dominating things.”\\nTelemachus spoke up with dignity.\\n“Most noble lords! This is insanity.\\nPerhaps you dined too well, or else some god\\nis stirring you. Now you have finished dinner,\\ngo home and sleep, whenever you are ready. \\nI will not force you out.”\\nThey bit their lips,\\nsurprised at the self-confidence he showed.\\nAmphinomus, the famous son of Nisus,\\ngrandson of Lord Aretias, spoke out\\nto all of them.\\n“My friends! What he has said\\nwas fair; no one need take oﬀense. Do not\\nabuse the stranger, nor the slaves who work\\nin great Odysseus’ house. The boy\\nshould fill the cups with wine, so we can pour\\nlibations, then go home. Telemachus \\ncan take care of the stranger—after all,\\nthe beggar came to his house.”\\nThey agreed.\\nAnd Moulius, the slave Amphinomus\\nhad brought there from Dulichium, mixed wine\\nfor all of them and shared the drinks around.\\nThey poured libations to the gods and sipped\\nthe cheering wine. When they had had enough,\\neach of them went back home, to his own bed.\\nBOOK \\nThe Queen and the Beggar\\nOdysseus was left there in the hall,\\nand with Athena, he was hatching plans\\nfor how to kill the suitors. Words flew fast:\\n“Telemachus, we have to get the weapons\\nand hide them. When the suitors see them gone\\nand question you, come up with good excuses.\\nYou can explain, ‘The soot had damaged them;\\nwhen King Odysseus marched oﬀ to Troy\\ntheir metal gleamed; now they are growing dull.\\nI put them safe away from all that smoke. \\nSome spirit also warned me if you drink\\ntoo much and argue, you could hurt each other,\\ndishonoring your banquet and your courtship.\\nWeapons themselves can tempt a man to fight.’”\\nTelemachus obeyed his father’s word.\\nHe summoned Eurycleia, and he told her,\\n“Shut up the women in their rooms, while I\\ncarry my father’s weapons to the storeroom.\\nThey have got dirty since my father left\\nwhen I was just a little boy. I want \\nto keep them safe, protected from the smoke.”\\nThe loving nurse said, “Child, I wish you would\\ntake charge of all the household management\\nand guard the wealth. Which girl should bring the torch?\\nYou said the slaves were not allowed to walk\\nin front of you.”\\nHe said, “This stranger will.\\nA man who eats my bread must work for me,\\neven if he has come from far away.”\\nShe made no answer but locked up the doors\\nthat led inside the hall. Odysseus \\nand his bright boy jumped up and got the helmets\\nand studded shields and pointed spears. Athena\\nstood by them with a golden lamp; she made\\nmajestic light. Telemachus said,\\n“Father,\\nmy eyes have noticed something very strange.\\nThe palace walls, the handsome fir-wood rafters\\nand crossbeams and the pillars high above\\nare visible, as if a fire were lit.\\nSome god from heaven must be in the house.”\\nBut cautiously Odysseus replied, \\n“Hush, no more questions, discipline your thoughts.\\nThis is the way of gods from Mount Olympus.\\nYou need to go to bed. I will stay here,\\nto aggravate the slave girls and your mother,\\nand make her cry, and let her question me.”\\nTelemachus went through the hall, lit up\\nby blazing torches, to his room. Sleep came,\\nand there he lay till Dawn. Odysseus\\nstayed in the hall, still plotting with Athena\\nhow to destroy the suitors.\\nThen the queen, \\nher wits about her, came down from her room,\\nlike Artemis or golden Aphrodite.\\nSlaves pulled her usual chair beside the fire;\\nit was inlaid with whorls of ivory\\nand silver, crafted by Icmalius,\\nwho had attached a footstool, all in one.\\nA great big fleece was laid across the chair,\\nand pensively Penelope sat down.\\nThe white-armed slave girls came and cleared away\\nthe piles of bread, the tables, and the cups, \\nfrom which the arrogant suitors had been drinking.\\nThey threw the embers from the braziers\\nonto the floor, and heaped fresh wood inside them\\nfor light and warmth.\\nAnd then Melantho scolded\\nOdysseus again. “Hey! Stranger! Will you\\nkeep causing trouble, roaming round our house\\nat night and spying on us women here?\\nGet out, you tramp! Be happy with your meal!\\nOr you will soon get pelted with a torch!\\nBe oﬀ!”\\nOdysseus began to scowl, \\nand made a calculated speech. “Insane!\\nYou silly girl, why are you mad at me?\\nBecause I am all dirty, dressed in rags,\\nand begging through the town? I have no choice.\\nThat is how homeless people have to live.\\nI used to have a house, and I was rich,\\nrespectable, and often gave to beggars;\\nI helped whoever came, no matter what.\\nI had a lot of slave girls too, and all\\nthe things we count as wealth; the happy life. \\nZeus ruined it. He must have wanted to.\\nGirl, may you never lose the rank you have\\namong the other slave girls—if your mistress\\ngets angry, or Odysseus arrives.\\nIt might still happen. But if he is dead\\nand never coming back, his son is now\\na man, praise be Apollo. He will notice\\nany misconduct from the women here.\\nHe is a grown-up now.”\\nPenelope\\nhad listened warily, and now she spoke \\nto scold the slave. “You brazen, shameless dog!\\nWhat impudence! I see what you are doing!\\nWipe that impertinent expression oﬀ!\\nYou knew quite well—I told you so myself—\\nthat I might keep the stranger in the hall\\nto question him about my missing husband.\\nI am weighed down by grief.”\\nAnd then she turned\\nto tell Eurynome, “Bring out a chair\\nand put a cushion on it, so this stranger\\ncan sit and talk with me. I want to ask him \\nsome questions.”\\nSo the woman brought a chair\\nof polished wood, and set a cushion on it.\\nOdysseus knew how to bide his time.\\nHe sat, and circumspect Penelope\\nbegan the conversation.\\n“Stranger, first\\nI want to ask what people you have come from.\\nWho are your parents? Where is your home town?”\\nCunning Odysseus said, “My good woman,\\nno mortal on the earth would speak against you;\\nyour glory reaches heaven. You must be \\nthe daughter of a holy king who ruled\\na mighty people with good laws; his rule\\nmade the black earth grow wheat and barley; trees\\nwere full of fruit; the sheep had lambs; the sea\\nprovided fish, and people thrived. This is\\nyour house. You have the right to question me,\\nbut do not ask about my family\\nor native land. The memory will fill\\nmy heart with pain. I am a man of sorrow.\\nI should not sit in someone else’s house \\nlamenting. It is rude to keep on grieving.\\nThe slaves, or even you, might criticize\\nand say my tearfulness is caused by wine.”\\nPenelope said cautiously, “Well, stranger,\\nthe deathless gods destroyed my strength and beauty\\nthe day the Greeks went marching oﬀ to Troy,\\nand my Odysseus went oﬀ with them.\\nIf he came back and cared for me again,\\nI would regain my beauty and my status.\\nBut now I suﬀer dreadfully; some god \\nhas ruined me. The lords of all the islands,\\nSame, Dulichium, and Zacynthus,\\nand those who live in Ithaca, are courting\\nme—though I do not want them to!—and spoiling\\nmy house. I cannot deal with suppliants,\\nstrangers and homeless men who want a job.\\nI miss Odysseus; my heart is melting.\\nThe suitors want to push me into marriage,\\nbut I spin schemes. Some god first prompted me\\nto set my weaving in the hall and work \\na long fine cloth. I said to all my suitors,\\n‘Although Odysseus is dead, postpone\\nrequests for marriage till I finish weaving\\nthis sheet to shroud Laertes when he dies.\\nMy work should not be wasted, or the people\\nin Argos will reproach me, if a man\\nwho won such wealth should lie without a shroud.’\\nThey acquiesced. By day I wove the web,\\nand in the night by torchlight, I unwove it.\\nI tricked them for three years; long hours went by \\nand days and months, but then, in the fourth year,\\nwith help from my own fickle, doglike slave girls,\\nthey came and caught me at it. Then they shouted\\nin protest, and they made me finish it.\\nI have no more ideas, and I cannot\\nfend oﬀ a marriage anymore. My parents\\nare pressing me to marry, and my son\\nknows that these men are wasting all his wealth\\nand he is sick of it. He has become\\nquite capable of caring for a house \\nthat Zeus has glorified. And now, you must\\nreveal your ancestry. You were not born\\nfrom rocks or trees, as in a fairy tale.”\\nThe master of deception answered, “Wife\\nof great Odysseus, Laertes’ son,\\nwhy will you not stop asking me about\\nmy family? I will speak, if I must.\\nBut you are making all my troubles worse.\\nIt is the way of things, when someone is\\naway from home as long as I have been, \\nroaming through many cities, many dangers.\\nStill, I will tell you what you ask. My homeland\\nis Crete, a fertile island out at sea.\\nI cannot count how many people live there,\\nin ninety cities, and our languages\\nare mixed; there are Achaeans, native Cretans,\\nand long-haired Dorians and Pelasgians.\\nKnossos is there, a mighty city where\\nMinos, the intimate of Zeus, was king\\nfor nine years, and my father was his son, \\nthe brave Deucalion, whose other son\\nwas Idomeneus, who sailed to Troy\\nwith the two sons of Atreus. My name\\nis Aethon, and I am the younger brother.\\nIn Crete, I saw Odysseus, and gave him\\nguest-gifts. A storm had driven him oﬀ course\\nat Malea, and carried him to Crete,\\nalthough he yearned for Troy. He narrowly\\nescaped the winds and found a refuge, mooring\\nhis ships in Amnisus, beside the cave \\nof Eileithyia. He came up to town,\\nand asked to see my brother, who, he said,\\nwas his good friend, a man he much admired.\\nBut Idomeneus had sailed to Troy\\nten days before. I asked him and his crew\\ninside and gave them all a lavish welcome;\\nour stores were ample, and I made the people\\nbring barley and red wine and bulls to butcher,\\nto satisfy their hearts. Those noble Greeks\\nstayed for twelve days; a mighty north wind trapped\\nthem; \\nso strong a person could not stand upright;\\nsome spirit must have summoned it to curse them.\\nBut on the thirteenth day, the wind died down;\\nthey sailed away.”\\nHis lies were like the truth,\\nand as she listened, she began to weep.\\nHer face was melting, like the snow that Zephyr\\nscatters across the mountain peaks; then Eurus\\nthaws it, and as it melts, the rivers swell\\nand flow again. So were her lovely cheeks\\ndissolved with tears. She wept for her own husband, \\nwho was right next to her. Odysseus\\npitied his grieving wife inside his heart,\\nbut kept his eyes quite still, without a flicker,\\nlike horn or iron, and he hid his tears\\nwith artifice. She cried a long, long time,\\nthen spoke again.\\n“Now stranger, I would like\\nto set a test, to see if you did host\\nmy husband and the men that followed him\\nin your own house, as you have said. Describe\\nhis clothes, and what he looked like, and his men.” \\nOdysseus the trickster said, “My lady,\\nthat would be hard to say—his visit was\\nso long ago. It has been twenty years.\\nBut I will tell the image in my mind.\\nKingly Odysseus wore a purple cloak,\\nof double-folded wool, held fastened by\\na golden brooch with double pins, that was\\nelaborately engraved. In its front paws\\na dog held down a struggling dappled fawn.\\nAll those who saw it marveled how the dog \\ncould grip the fawn, and how the fawn could kick\\nits legs and try to get away, though both\\nwere made of gold. I noticed his white tunic\\nwas soft as dried-up onion peel, and shiny\\nas sunlight. It astonished many women.\\nBut note, I do not know if he had brought\\nthese clothes from home, or if a crew member\\nhad given them to him on board the ship,\\nor some guest-friend. Odysseus had many\\ndear friends, since very few could match his worth. \\nAnd I myself gave him a sword of bronze,\\na double-folded purple cloak, and tunic\\nedged with a fringe. I sent him oﬀ in glory\\nwhen he embarked. He had a valet with him,\\nI do remember, named Eurybates,\\na man a little older than himself,\\nwho had black skin, round shoulders, woolly hair,\\nand was his favorite out of all his crew\\nbecause his mind matched his.”\\nThese words increased\\nher grief. She knew the signs that he had planted \\nas evidence, and sobbed; she wept profusely.\\nPausing, she said, “I pitied you before,\\nbut now you are a guest and honored friend.\\nI gave those clothes to him that you describe;\\nI took them from the storeroom, folded them,\\nand clasped that brooch for him. But I will never\\nwelcome him home. A curse sailed on that ship\\nwhen he went oﬀ to see Evilium—\\nthe town I will not name.”\\nHe answered shrewdly,\\n“Your Majesty, Odysseus’ wife, \\nstop ruining your pretty skin with tears,\\nand grieving for your husband, brokenhearted.\\nI do not blame you; any woman would\\nmourn for a husband by whom she had children,\\neven if he were not the kind of man\\nthey say your husband was—a godlike hero.\\nBut stop your crying. Listen. I will tell you\\na certainty. I will be frank with you.\\nI heard Odysseus is coming home.\\nHe is alive and near here, in Thesprotia. \\nBy hustling, he gained a heap of treasure\\nthat he is bringing home. He lost his ship\\nat sea, and let his loyal men be killed\\nwhen he had left Thrinacia; Helius\\nand Zeus despised Odysseus, because\\nhis men had killed the Cattle of the Sun.\\nSo all those men were drowned beneath the waves,\\nbut he himself was clinging to the rudder\\nand washed up in the land of the Phaeacians,\\nthe cousins of the gods. They honored him \\nas if he were a god himself, and gave him\\nabundant gifts, and tried to send him home\\nsafely. He would have been here long ago,\\nbut he decided he should travel more\\nand gather greater wealth. No man on earth\\nknows better how to make a profit. Pheidon,\\nthe king of the Thesprotians, told me this.\\nHe poured libations and he swore to me\\nthere was a ship already launched and crew\\nall set to take him home. But Pheidon said \\ngood-bye to me first, as a ship of theirs\\nhappened to be already on its way\\nto barley-rich Dulichium. He showed me\\nthe treasure that Odysseus had gained—\\nenough to feed his children and grandchildren\\nfor ten whole generations. Pheidon said\\nOdysseus had gone to Dodona,\\nto ask the rustling oak leaves whether Zeus\\nadvised him, after all those years away,\\nto go home openly or in disguise. \\nI tell you, he is safe and near at hand.\\nHe will not long be absent from his home\\nand those that love him. I swear this by Zeus,\\nthe highest, greatest god, and by the hearth\\nwhere I am sheltering. This will come true\\nas I have said. This very lunar month,\\nbetween the waning and the waxing moon\\nOdysseus will come.”\\nPenelope\\nsaid warily, “Well, stranger, I do hope\\nthat you are right. If so, I would reward you \\nat once with such warm generosity\\nthat everyone you met would see your luck.\\nIn fact, it seems to me, Odysseus\\nwill not come home. No one will see you oﬀ\\nwith kind good-byes. There is no master here\\nto welcome visitors as he once did\\nand send them oﬀ with honor. Was there ever\\na man like him? Now slaves, give him a wash\\nand make a bed with mattress, woolen blankets\\nand fresh clean sheets, to keep him warm till Dawn \\nassumes her golden throne. Then bathe and oil him;\\nseat him inside the hall, beside my son,\\nand let him eat. If any of these men\\nis so corrupt that he would harm our guest,\\nthe worse for him! He will get nowhere here,\\nhowever much he rages. Stranger, how\\ncould you have evidence that I excel\\nall other women in intelligence,\\nif you were kept in rags, your skin all sunburnt,\\nin my house? Human beings have short lives. \\nIf we are cruel, everyone will curse us\\nduring our life, and mock us when we die.\\nThe names of those who act with nobleness\\nare brought by travelers across the world,\\nand many people speak about their goodness.”\\nBut devious Odysseus said, “Wife\\nof great Odysseus, I started hating\\nblankets and fine clean sheets the day I rowed\\nfrom cloudy, mountainous Crete. I will lie down\\nas I have spent so many sleepless nights, \\non some rough pallet, waiting for bright Dawn.\\nI do not care for footbaths; do not let\\nany of these slave women in your house\\ncome near my feet, unless there is an old one\\nwhom I can trust, who has endured the same\\nheartbreak and sorrow as myself. If so,\\nI would not mind if she should touch my feet.”\\nPenelope said thoughtfully, “Dear guest,\\nhow well you speak! No visitor before\\nwho came into my house from foreign lands \\nhas ever been so scrupulous. I have\\na sensible old woman, who brought up\\nmy husband. She first took him in her arms\\nfrom his own mother as a newborn child.\\nShe is quite weak, but she can wash your feet.\\nGet up now, Eurycleia, wash your master’s\\nage-mate. By now, Odysseus himself\\nmust have old wrinkled feet and hands like these.\\nWe mortals grow old fast in times of trouble.”\\nThe old slave shed hot tears, and held her hands \\nacross her face, and wailed,\\n“Oh, child! I am\\nso useless to you now! Zeus hated you\\nbeyond all other men, although you are\\nso god-fearing! No human ever burned\\nso many thigh-bones to the Lord of Thunder,\\nor sacrificed so much to him. You prayed\\nthat you would reach a comfortable old age\\nand raise your son to be respected. Now\\nyou are the only one who cannot reach\\nyour home. And when that poor Odysseus \\nstays at the palaces of foreign kings,\\nI think the women slaves are mocking him\\nas these bad girls are hounding you. You have\\nrefused to let them wash you, to avoid\\nabuse. But wise Penelope has told me\\nto wash you, and reluctantly I will,\\nfor her sake and for yours—you move my heart.\\nNow listen. Many strangers have come here\\nin trouble and distress. But I have never\\nseen any man whose body, voice, and feet \\nare so much like my master’s.”\\nHe replied\\nshrewdly, “Old woman, everyone who sees\\nthe two of us says we are much alike;\\nyou were perceptive to observe the likeness.”\\nThen the old woman took the shining cauldron\\nused for a footbath, and she filled it up\\nwith water—lots of cold, a splash of hot.\\nOdysseus sat there beside the hearth,\\nand hurriedly turned round to face the darkness.\\nHe had a premonition in his heart \\nthat when she touched him, she would feel his scar\\nand all would be revealed. She kneeled beside him,\\nand washed her master. Suddenly, she felt\\nthe scar. A white-tusked boar had wounded him\\non Mount Parnassus long ago. He went there\\nwith his maternal cousins and grandfather,\\nnoble Autolycus, who was the best\\nof all mankind at telling lies and stealing.\\nHermes gave him this talent to reward him\\nfor burning many oﬀerings to him. \\nMuch earlier, Autolycus had gone\\nto Ithaca to see his daughter’s baby,\\nand Eurycleia put the newborn child\\non his grandfather’s lap and said, “Now name\\nyour grandson—this much-wanted baby boy.”\\nHe told the parents, “Name him this. I am\\ndisliked by many, all across the world,\\nand I dislike them back. So name the child\\n‘Odysseus.’ And when he is a man,\\nlet him come to his mother’s people’s house, \\nby Mount Parnassus. I will give him treasure\\nand send him home rejoicing.” When he grew,\\nOdysseus came there to claim his gifts.\\nHis cousins and Autolycus embraced him,\\nand greeted him with friendly words of welcome.\\nHis grandma, Amphithea, wrapped her arms\\naround him like a vine and kissed his face\\nand shining eyes. Autolycus instructed\\nhis sons to make the dinner. They obeyed\\nand brought a bull of five years old and flayed it, \\nand chopped it all in pieces, and then sliced\\nthe meat with skill and portioned it on skewers\\nand roasted it with care, and shared it out,\\nand everybody got the same amount.\\nThe whole day long they feasted, till the sun\\nwent down and darkness fell. Then they lay down\\nand took the gift of sleep. When early Dawn,\\nthe newborn child with rosy hands, appeared,\\nAutolycus went hunting with his dogs\\nand with his sons; Odysseus went too. \\nUp the steep wooded side of Mount Parnassus\\nthey climbed and reached its windswept folds. The sun\\nrose from the calmly flowing depths of Ocean\\nto touch the fields, just as the hunters came\\ninto a glen. The dogs had dashed in front,\\nlooking for tracks. Autolycus’ sons\\ncame after, with Odysseus who kept\\nclose to the dogs, and brandished his long spear.\\nA mighty boar lurked there; its lair was thick,\\nprotected from the wind; the golden sun \\ncould never strike at it with shining rays,\\nand rain could not get in; there was a pile\\nof fallen leaves inside. The boar had heard\\nthe sound of feet—the men and dogs were near.\\nOut of his hiding place he leapt to face them,\\nhis bristles standing up, his eyes like fire,\\nand stood right next to them. Odysseus\\nwas first to rush at him, his long spear gripped\\ntight in his hand. He tried to strike; the boar\\nstruck first, above his knee, and charging sideways \\nscooped a great hunk of flesh oﬀ with his tusk,\\nbut did not reach the bone. Odysseus\\nwounded the boar’s right shoulder, and the spear\\npierced through. The creature howled and fell to earth.\\nHis life flew out. Autolycus’ sons\\nbustled around and skillfully bound up\\nthe wound received by great Odysseus,\\nand stopped the black blood with a charm, and took him\\nback to their father’s house, and nursed him well,\\nthen gave him splendid gifts, and promptly sent him \\nback home to Ithaca, and he was glad.\\nHis parents welcomed him and asked him questions,\\nwanting to know how he had got the wound.\\nHe told them he was hunting with his cousins\\non Mount Parnassus, and a boar attacked him;\\nthe white tusk pierced his leg.\\nThe old slave woman,\\nholding his leg and rubbing with flat palms,\\ncame to that place, and recognized the scar.\\nShe let his leg fall down into the basin.\\nIt clattered, tilted over, and the water \\nspilled out across the floor. Both joy and grief\\ntook hold of her. Her eyes were filled with tears;\\nher voice was choked. She touched his beard and said,\\n“You are Odysseus! My darling child!\\nMy master! I did not know it was you\\nuntil I touched you all around your leg.”\\nShe glanced towards Penelope, to tell her\\nit was her husband. But Penelope\\ndid not look back; she could not meet her eyes,\\nbecause Athena turned her mind aside. \\nOdysseus grabbed her throat with his right hand\\nand with the left, he pulled her close and whispered,\\n“Nanny! Why are you trying to destroy me?\\nYou fed me at your breast! Now after all\\nmy twenty years of pain, I have arrived\\nback to my home. You have found out; a god\\nhas put the knowledge in your mind. Be silent;\\nno one must know, or else I promise you,\\nif some god helps me bring the suitors down,\\nI will not spare you when I kill the rest, \\nthe other slave women, although you were\\nmy nurse.”\\nWith calculation, Eurycleia\\nanswered, “My child! What have you said! You know\\nmy mind is firm, unshakable; I will\\nremain as strong as stone or iron. Let me\\npromise you this: if you defeat the suitors,\\nI will tell you which women in the palace\\ndishonor you, and which are free from guilt.”\\nOdysseus already had a plan.\\n“Nanny, why do you mention them? No need. \\nI will myself make my own observations\\nof each of them. Be quiet now; entrust\\nthe future to the gods.”\\nThe old nurse went\\nto fetch more washing water; all the rest\\nwas spilt. She washed and oiled him, and then\\nhe pulled his chair beside the fire again,\\nto warm himself, and covered up his scar\\nwith rags. And carefully Penelope\\nspoke to him.\\n“Stranger, I have one small question\\nI want to ask you. It will soon be time \\nto lie down comfortably—at least for those\\nwho can enjoy sweet sleep, no matter what.\\nBut I have been aﬄicted by some god\\nwith pain beyond all measure. In the day,\\nI concentrate on my work and my women’s,\\ndespite my constant grief. But when night comes,\\nand everybody goes to sleep, I lie\\ncrying in bed and overwhelmed by pain;\\nworries and sorrows crowd into my heart.\\nAs when the daughter of Pandareus, \\nthe pale gray nightingale, sings beautifully\\nwhen spring has come, and sits among the leaves\\nthat crowd the trees, and warbles up and down\\na symphony of sound, in mourning for\\nher son by Zethus, darling Itylus,\\nwhom she herself had killed in ignorance,\\nwith bronze. Just so, my mind pulls two directions—\\nshould I stay here beside my son, and keep\\nthings all the same—my property, my slave girls,\\nand my great house—to show respect towards \\nmy husband’s bed and what the people say?\\nOr should I marry one of them—whichever\\nis best of all the suitors and can bring\\nmost presents? When my son was immature,\\nand young, I could not leave my husband’s house.\\nHe would not let me. Now that he is big\\nand all grown-up, he urges me to go;\\nhe is concerned that they are eating up\\nhis property. Now how do you interpret\\nthis dream of mine? I dreamed that twenty geese \\ncame from the river to my house, and they\\nwere eating grain and I was glad to see them.\\nThen a huge eagle with a pointed beak\\nswooped from the mountain, broke their necks, and\\nkilled them.\\nI wept and wailed, inside the dream; the women\\ngathered around me, and I cried because\\nthe eagle killed my geese. Then he came back\\nand sitting on the jutting roof-beam, spoke\\nin human language, to restrain my grief.\\n‘Penelope, great queen, cheer up. This is \\nno dream; it will come true. It is a vision.\\nThe geese are suitors; I was once an eagle,\\nbut now I am your husband. I have come\\nback home to put a cruel end to them.’\\nThen I woke up, looked round, and saw the geese\\nstill eating grain beside the trough as they\\nhad done before.”\\nOdysseus, well-known\\nfor his intelligence, said, “My dear woman,\\nthere is no way to wrest another meaning\\nout of the dream; Odysseus himself \\nsaid how he will fulfill it: it means ruin\\nfor all the suitors. No one can protect them\\nfrom death.”\\nBut shrewd Penelope said, “Stranger,\\ndreams are confusing, and not all come true.\\nThere are two gates of dreams: one pair is made\\nof horn and one of ivory. The dreams\\nfrom ivory are full of trickery;\\ntheir stories turn out false. The ones that come\\nthrough polished horn come true. But my strange dream\\ndid not come out that way, I think. I wish \\nit had, as does my son. The day of doom\\nis coming that will take me from the house\\nof my Odysseus. I will arrange\\na contest with his axes. He would set them\\nall in a row, like ship’s props. From a distance\\nhe shot an arrow through all twelve of them.\\nI will assign this contest to the suitors.\\nWhoever strings his bow most readily,\\nand shoots through all twelve axes, will win me,\\nand I will follow him. I will be parted \\nfrom here, this lovely house, my marriage home,\\nso full of wealth and life, which I suppose\\nI will remember even in my dreams.”\\nScheming Odysseus said, “Honored wife\\nof great Odysseus, do not postpone\\nthis contest. They will fumble with the bow\\nand will not finish stringing it or shooting\\nthe arrow through, before Odysseus,\\nthe mastermind, arrives.”\\nShe chose her words\\nwith care: “If you would sit and entertain me, \\nguest, I would never wish to go to sleep.\\nBut humans cannot stay awake forever;\\nimmortal gods have set a proper time\\nfor everything that mortals do on earth.\\nI will go up and lie down on my bed,\\nwhich is a bed of grief, all stained with tears\\nthat I have cried since he went oﬀ to see\\nEvilium, the town I will not name.\\nI will lie there, and you lie in this house;\\nspread blankets on the floor, or have the slaves \\nmake up a bed.”\\nWith that, she went upstairs,\\naccompanied by slave girls. In her room,\\nshe cried for her dear husband, till sharp-sighted\\nAthena poured sweet sleep onto her eyes.\\nBOOK \\nThe Last Banquet\\nOdysseus was lying at the entrance\\non an untreated oxhide, over which\\nhe heaped a pile of fleeces from the sheep\\nthe suitors sacrificed. Eurynome\\nspread a thick blanket over him. He lay there\\nbut did not sleep; his mind was plotting how\\nto kill the suitors. Then the girls who had\\nbeen sleeping with suitors slipped outside,\\ngiggling and happy to be out together.\\nHis heart was roused to rage; he wondered whether \\nto jump at them and slaughter every one,\\nor let them have one very final night\\nwith those proud suitors—and his heart was barking,\\njust as a mother dog will stand astride\\nher little puppies, bristling to fight,\\nif she sees any man she does not know;\\nso his heart growled inside him; he was shocked\\nat their behavior. He slapped his chest\\nand told himself,\\n“Be strong, my heart. You were\\nhounded by worse the day the Cyclops ate \\nyour strong companions. But you kept your nerve,\\ntill cunning saved you from the cave; you thought\\nthat you would die there.”\\nSo his heart held firm\\nand constant, but he writhed around, as when\\na man rotates a sausage full of fat\\nand blood; the huge fire blazes, and he longs\\nto have the roasting finished. So he squirmed,\\nthis way and that, and wondered how he could\\nattack the shameless suitors, being one\\nagainst a multitude. Athena came \\nfrom heaven and stood near him, at his head,\\nresembling a woman, and she said,\\n“Why are you wide awake, unlucky man?\\nThis is your house, this is your wife inside,\\nand your own child, the son you hoped to have.”\\nClever Odysseus said, “Goddess, yes,\\nall that is true. But I am wondering how\\nI can attack those upstarts, who are always\\nclustered together, while I am alone.\\nMy biggest fear is this: if you and Zeus \\nhelp me to kill them, then what? Where can I\\nrun to escape my punishment? You tell me!”\\nWith glinting eyes Athena said, “So stubborn!\\nMost men trust friends—even weaker, mortal friends,\\nwhose judgment is far worse than mine. I am\\na goddess, and throughout your many trials,\\nI have watched over you. If we were ambushed,\\nsurrounded by not one but fifty gangs\\nof men who hoped to murder us—you would\\nescape, and even poach their sheep and cows. \\nNow go to sleep. To stay on guard awake\\nall night is tiring. Quite soon you will\\ndistance yourself, Odysseus, from trouble.”\\nWith that, the goddess drenched his eyes with sleep,\\nthen flew back to Olympus. Sleep took hold,\\nrelaxed him, and released him from his worries.\\nMeanwhile, his faithful wife was wide awake,\\ncrying and sitting upright on her bed\\nagainst soft pillows. When her sobs subsided,\\nshe prayed.\\n“O Artemis! Majestic goddess! \\nDaughter of Zeus! If only you would shoot\\nan arrow in my heart and kill me now,\\nor let a gust of wind take hold of me\\nand carry me across the misty clouds\\nand fling me where the waters of the Ocean\\npour forth and back again, as when the breezes\\ntook up the daughters of Pandareus,\\nafter the gods destroyed their parents, leaving\\nthe daughters orphaned. Aphrodite helped them,\\nand gave them honey, cheese, and mellow wine, \\nand Hera gave them beauty and good sense,\\nabove all other women; Artemis\\nincreased their height; Athena taught them how\\nto be most skillful in all handiwork.\\nThen Aphrodite went to Mount Olympus\\nto ask Zeus, Thunderlord, to grant the girls\\ngood marriages—he knows all things, all fates,\\nboth good and bad. But Harpies seized and forced them\\nto serve the cruel Furies. May the gods\\nannihilate me just like them! Or may \\nArtemis strike me dead, with my gaze fixed\\nupon Odysseus! Let me not make\\na lesser husband glad. When someone weeps\\nall through the day quite overwhelmed by grief,\\nbut sleeps at night, forgetting everything,\\nher pain is bearable. But I am cursed\\nwith nightmares by some god. Last night, a man\\nwas sleeping by me, just like him when he\\nmarched oﬀ to war. My heart was cheered; it seemed\\na vision, not a dream.”\\nAs she said this, \\nthe golden Dawn arrived. Odysseus\\nheard his wife weeping, and became confused;\\nhe thought that she was standing by his head,\\nand that she had already recognized him.\\nHe took the cloak and fleece with which he slept,\\nand put them on a chair inside the palace,\\nand took the oxhide outside to the courtyard,\\nthen raised his arms and prayed.\\n“O Father Zeus!\\nO gods! If you have brought me back on purpose\\nacross dry land and sea to my own home, \\nafter you made me suﬀer all that pain,\\nlet someone inside speak in words of omen,\\nand Zeus, display another sign outside.”\\nZeus, Lord of Cunning, heard him, and he thundered\\nfrom bright Olympus, high above the clouds;\\nOdysseus was happy. Then a woman,\\na wheat grinder, inside the house nearby,\\nspoke words of omen. Twelve slaves worked the mills\\nto grind the wheat and barley for the king.\\nThe rest had finished and had gone to sleep. \\nThe weakest one was still at work. She paused\\nher mill, and spoke—he heard it as an omen.\\n“Zeus, king of gods and humans! You made thunder\\nboom from a cloudless sky—a sign for someone.\\nFulfill a poor slave’s prayer: that this will be\\nthe last day that the suitors dine in style\\nhere in the old king’s house. My knees are sore\\nfrom this exhausting work of grinding grain\\nfor them. I pray this is their final meal!”\\nThis sign and Zeus’ thunder made her master \\nglad, and more certain he would get revenge\\non those who did him wrong.\\nThe other women\\ngathered and lit a fire in the hearth.\\nGodlike Telemachus got out of bed\\nand dressed, and slung his sword across his back.\\nHe tied his sandals on his well-oiled feet,\\nand took his sharp and sturdy bronze-tipped spear.\\nStanding across the threshold, he called out\\nto Eurycleia.\\n“Nanny! Did you women\\nmake sure our guest was honored, with a meal \\nand comfortable bed? Or did he lie there\\nneglected? This is typical of Mother!\\nShe may be clever, but she acts on whims!\\nShe treats unwanted guests with great respect,\\nand rudely sends the better ones away.”\\nThe nurse said tactfully, “Child, do not blame her,\\nnot now. He drank some wine, and chose a chair.\\nHe said he had already had his dinner—\\nshe asked him. And at bedtime, she brought out\\na cot, so that the girls could make his bed. \\nPoor destitute old man! He would not take\\nnice bedding. He slept outside on the porch,\\non oxhide and a fleece; we spread a cloak\\non top of him.”\\nTelemachus marched oﬀ\\nout of the palace, with his sword in hand,\\naccompanied by two swift dogs, and went\\ndown to the meeting place of the Achaeans.\\nThen noble Eurycleia, child of Ops,\\ncalled to the slaves.\\n“Now hurry! You girls sweep\\nthe floors and sprinkle them. Spread purple cloths \\nacross the chairs. You others, sponge the tables,\\nand wash the double-handled cups and bowls.\\nAnd you, go fetch the water from the spring.\\nBe quick! They will be coming soon; it is\\na festival for all of them today.”\\nThey listened carefully and followed orders.\\nTwenty ran oﬀ to fetch the dark spring water;\\nthe other well-trained slaves were working hard \\naround the house. The able-bodied men\\ncame in and chopped the wood. They knew their work.\\nThe women got back from the spring, and with them\\nthe swineherd came with three fat pigs—his best.\\nHe penned them in the yard to root around,\\nand kindly asked Odysseus,\\n“My friend,\\nare they now treating you with more respect,\\nor still abusing you, just as before?”\\nOdysseus, the cunning strategist,\\nreplied, “Eumaeus, may the gods avenge\\nthese upstarts for their wickedness and schemes!\\nThe scoundrels have abused me in a house \\nwhich is not theirs! They show no shame!”\\nWhile they\\nwere talking in this way, Melanthius\\narrived with two more herders. They were driving\\nthe very fattest she-goats from the flock—\\na contribution to the suitors’ banquet.\\nHe tied the goats up on the portico,\\nand started picking on Odysseus.\\n“Stranger! Are you still here, still causing trouble,\\nwith begging and annoying those inside?\\nI promise you a beating if you stay! \\nYour begging is not welcome! This is not\\nthe only place in Greece where there is food.”\\nInscrutable Odysseus said nothing;\\nhe bowed his head in silence, contemplating\\nhis murderous plans.\\nThe third and final herdsman,\\nPhiloetius, an overseer, came\\nherding fat he-goats and an uncalved heifer,\\nbrought by a ferryman to Ithaca—\\nthe ferries also carry passengers\\nwhen anybody needs to get across. \\nPhiloetius tied up his animals\\noutside, and asked the swineherd,\\n“Who is this\\nnew guest who has arrived? Who are his people?\\nWhere is his native land? His ancestry?\\nPoor man, he has a kingly look; his bearing\\nis like a lord’s. When gods spin threads of pain,\\neven great kings are made to wander far\\nand suﬀer greatly.”\\nThen he shook his hand\\nand greeted him. “Good morning, sir! You are\\ndown on your luck; I hope things change for you. \\nNo god is more destructive, Zeus, than you!\\nYou are the father of humanity,\\nbut you do not take pity on our pain.\\nMy eyes are wet, my skin is damp with sweat,\\nas I think of Odysseus. If he\\nstill lives and sees the sun, he must be lost,\\nand dressed in rags like these. Or if he has\\nalready died, oh, Lord Odysseus!\\nI am so sorry! He entrusted me\\nwith my first herd when I was just a boy, \\nin Cephallenia. His cattle now\\nare countless; they would not have multiplied\\nso well for someone else. But now these men\\nare telling me to drive the cows to them\\nfor food. They do not care about the boy,\\nor tremble at the eyes of watchful gods.\\nMy master has been gone a long time now.\\nThey want to share his wealth among themselves,\\nand I keep turning over in my mind\\nthat it would not be right to take the cows \\nand go to foreign lands, when master’s son\\nis here. But it is worse to sit and suﬀer,\\njust taking care of other people’s cattle.\\nI would have run away and gone to serve\\nanother king; things are unbearable.\\nBut I keep hoping my unlucky master\\nwill come back from wherever he may be\\nand scatter all these suitors in his halls.”\\nCrafty Odysseus replied, “I see\\nyou are intelligent. So I will swear \\na solemn oath to you. I vow by Zeus,\\nand hospitality, and by this hearth,\\nthat while you are still here, Odysseus\\nwill come back home, and if you want, you can\\nwatch as the boys who swagger here are killed.”\\nThe cowherd answered, “Stranger, may Zeus make\\nyour words come true—and you would see my strength,\\nand how prepared my hands would be to fight.”\\nEumaeus also prayed to all the gods\\nto bring his many-minded master home. \\nAs they were talking in this way, the suitors\\nwere planning how to kill Telemachus.\\nBut then an eagle flew high on their left,\\nholding a wild dove. Amphinomus\\nsaid to them, “Friends, this plan of ours, this murder,\\nwill fail. So let us think about our banquet.”\\nThey all agreed, and went inside the house\\nof godlike King Odysseus. They spread\\ncloths on the chairs and sofas, and they killed\\nlarge sheep, fat goats, big pigs, and one tame cow. \\nThey cooked the innards and divided them,\\nand mixed the wine in bowls; the swineherd poured it\\ninto the cups. Philoetius served bread\\nin baskets, and Melanthius passed round\\nthe wine. They helped themselves to all the food.\\nThen thinking carefully, Telemachus\\nseated Odysseus inside the hall,\\nbeside the stony threshold, and he brought\\na table and a stool. He served him meat\\nand poured a gold cup full of wine, and said, \\n“Now you are sitting here and drinking wine\\namong them. I will stop them touching you\\nor mocking you. This is no public house!\\nOdysseus acquired it for me.\\nAnd you there, suitors! Please, no blows or insults.\\nWe do not want to start an argument.”\\nThey bit their lips, surprised to hear the boy\\nspeaking so boldly, and Antinous,\\nEupeithes’ son, declared,\\n“My lords, we must\\naccept the threats Telemachus has made, \\nannoying though they are. Zeus would not let us\\nkill him—or else by now we could have stopped\\nhis speechifying in our banquet hall.”\\nTelemachus ignored him, and meanwhile,\\nthe house boys drove one hundred animals\\nthrough town for sacrifice. The Ithacans\\nassembled at Apollo’s shady grove—\\nthe lord of archery.\\nInside the house,\\nthe suitors cooked the meat kebabs, took out\\nthe skewers, then divided up the portions— \\na splendid feast. They served Odysseus\\nan equal portion with their own; his son,\\nTelemachus, had ordered them to do so.\\nBut still Athena would not let the suitors\\nrefrain from hurtful insults and abuse,\\nso even deeper bitterness would sink\\ninto the heart of great Odysseus.\\nOne lawless man from Same named Ctesippus,\\nencouraged by extraordinary wealth,\\nhad come to court Odysseus’ wife \\nbecause he had been absent for so long.\\nHe shouted to the other reckless suitors,\\n“Listen! This stranger got an equal share,\\nas is appropriate. It would, of course,\\nbe wrong to disrespect a guest who comes\\nto visit our Telemachus. Let me\\ngive him a welcome gift, so he can give\\ngifts to the bath attendant or some other\\nhouse slave here in the palace.”\\nThen he grabbed\\nan ox-foot from the basket, and he hurled it \\ntowards Odysseus, who smoothly ducked,\\nbowing his head, and smiled in scornful rage.\\nThe ox-foot struck the wall. Telemachus\\nscolded Ctesippus.\\n“You were very lucky\\nyou failed to hit the stranger; he avoided\\nthe blow himself. I would have thrust my sword\\nright through your belly, and your father would\\nhave held your funeral, and not your wedding.\\nSo from now on, you all should stay in check,\\nhere in my house. I used to be a child, \\nbut now I understand things, good and bad.\\nI have to watch and put up with all this:\\nthe slaughtered sheep, the food, the wine. It is\\nhard for a single man to put a stop\\nto such a multitude. But please back down\\nfrom your hostility to me. Or if\\nyou do still want to kill me with bronze swords,\\ngo on; I want you to. It would be better\\nto die, than have to watch you suitors acting\\nso horribly—abusing strangers, dragging \\nthe house girls through my home, molesting them.”\\nThey all fell silent. Agelaus spoke.\\n“My friends, his words are fair. Do not get angry\\nor argue back with him. Do not abuse\\nthe stranger, or Odysseus’ slaves.\\nTelemachus, I oﬀer some advice\\nto you and to your mother, with respect.\\nI hope you can accept it. While you thought\\nyour many-minded father would come home,\\nthere was no harm in holding us at bay, \\nand waiting, in case he came back again.\\nNow it is obvious he will not come.\\nSo boy, sit by your mother, and advise her\\nto choose the best, most generous of us\\nto marry; then you can enjoy the wealth\\nleft by your father, eat and drink, and she\\ncan go take care of someone else’s house.”\\nTelemachus inhaled, then answered, “Yes!\\nBy Zeus and by my father’s suﬀerings—\\nlost far from Ithaca, or maybe dead— \\nI will cause no delay, and I will tell her\\nto pick a husband, and I will provide\\na lavish dowry. But I am reluctant\\nto force her if she does not want to go.\\nMay no god make that happen!” So he spoke.\\nAthena turned the suitors’ minds; they laughed\\nunstoppably. They cackled, and they lost\\ncontrol of their own faces. Plates of meat\\nbegan to drip with blood. Their eyes were full\\nof tears, and they began to wail in grief. \\nThe prophet Theoclymenus addressed them.\\n“What awful thing is happening to you?\\nYour faces, heads, and bodies are wrapped up\\nin night; your screams are blazing out like fire.\\nThe ornate palace ceilings and the walls\\nare spattered with your blood. The porch is full\\nof ghosts, as is the courtyard—ghosts descending\\ninto the dark of Erebus. The sun\\nhas vanished from the sky, and gloomy mist\\nis all around.”\\nAt these words, they all laughed. \\nEurymachus spoke up.\\n“This new arrival\\nhas lost his mind! Quick, fellows, throw him out!\\nMake him go to the marketplace—he thinks\\nit is like night in here!”\\nThe prophet answered,\\n“Eurymachus, I will not ask for guides.\\nI have good eyes and ears and feet; my mind\\nis working perfectly, and I am leaving.\\nI sense some evil coming for you all,\\nwho sit here in Odysseus’ house\\ntormenting and oppressing other people. \\nNot one of you will get away.”\\nWith that,\\nhe left the palace and went down to meet\\nPiraeus, and was welcomed there.\\nThe suitors,\\nwith glances at each other, tried to tease\\nTelemachus by laughing at his guests.\\n“What awful luck you have with visitors!\\nHere is this dirty beggar, always wanting\\nmore food and wine, who is unskilled in farmwork\\nor fighting—a mere burden on the earth!\\nThat other one just stood there prophesying! \\nNow listen—I propose a better plan.\\nPack up your strangers on a boat as slaves;\\nsend them to Sicily, and make a profit!”\\nTelemachus ignored the suitors’ words,\\nand watched his father quietly, still waiting\\nfor when they should attack the shameless suitors.\\nThe beautiful Penelope had wisely\\nset up her chair to face them, and she listened\\nto what each man was saying. They had killed\\nnumerous animals, and made their banquet \\nwith laughter. But no dinnertime could be\\nless welcome than the one the mighty man\\nand goddess would soon bring them, in revenge,\\nbecause they started it and wronged him first.\\nBOOK \\nAn Archery Contest\\nWith glinting eyes, Athena put a thought\\ninto the mind of wise Penelope,\\nthe daughter of Icarius: to place\\nthe bow and iron axes in the hall\\nof great Odysseus, and set the contest\\nwhich would begin the slaughter. She went up\\nto her own room. Her muscular, firm hand\\npicked up the ivory handle of the key—\\na hook of bronze. Then with her slaves she walked\\ndown to the storeroom where the master kept \\nhis treasure: gold and bronze and well-wrought iron.\\nThe curving bow and deadly arrows lay there,\\ngiven by Iphitus, Eurytus’ son,\\nthe godlike man he happened to befriend\\nat wise Ortilochus’ house, far oﬀ\\nin Lacedaemon, in Messenia.\\nOdysseus had gone to claim a debt—\\nsome people of Messenia had come\\nin rowing boats and poached three hundred sheep\\nfrom Ithaca; they took their shepherds too. \\nLaertes and the other older men\\nhad sent Odysseus to fetch them back\\nwhen he was still a boy. And Iphitus\\nhad come there for his horses, twelve fine mares,\\neach suckling a sturdy mule. These horses\\nwould later cause his death, when he had gone\\nto visit Heracles, who welcomed him,\\nbut killed him, so that he could take the horses—\\nbetraying hospitality, and heedless\\nabout the watchful gods. Before all that, \\nwhen Iphitus first met Odysseus,\\nhe gave this bow to him, inherited\\nfrom his own father. And Odysseus\\ngave Iphitus a sword and spear, to mark\\ntheir bond. But Iphitus was dead before\\nthe friends could visit one another’s houses.\\nSo when Odysseus’ black fleet sailed\\nto war, he did not take the bow, but stored it\\nin his own house, to use in Ithaca\\nin memory of his friend.\\nThe queen had reached \\nthe storeroom, and she stepped across the threshold\\nof polished oak; a skillful carpenter\\nhad set it level, fixed the frame, and built\\nthe dazzling double doors. She quickly loosed\\nthe door-thong from its hook, pushed in the key\\nand with true aim, thrust back the fastenings.\\nThe fine doors, as the key struck home, began\\nto bellow as a bull at pasture bellows.\\nAt once, they flew apart. She stepped inside,\\nonto the pallet where the scented clothes \\nwere stored in chests, and reached to lift the bow\\ndown from its hook, still in its shining case.\\nShe sat down on the floor to take it out,\\nresting it on her lap, and started sobbing\\nand wailing as she saw her husband’s bow.\\nAt last, she dried her eyes, and in her arms\\npicked up the curving bow and quiver, packed\\nwith many deadly arrows, and she went\\nto meet her arrogant suitors. Slaves lugged out\\na hamper with their master’s many axes \\nof bronze and iron, for the competition.\\nThe queen came near the suitors, and she stopped\\nbeside a pillar with a filmy veil\\nacross her face. Two slave girls stood with her.\\nShe said,\\n“Now listen, lords. You keep on coming\\nto this house every day, to eat and drink,\\nwasting the wealth of someone who has been\\naway too long. Your motives are no secret.\\nYou want to marry me. I am the prize.\\nSo I will set a contest. This great bow \\nbelonged to godlike King Odysseus.\\nIf anyone can grasp it in his hands\\nand string it easily, and shoot through all\\ntwelve axes, I will marry him, and leave\\nthis beautiful rich house, so full of life,\\nmy lovely bridal home. I think I will\\nremember it forever, even in\\nmy dreams.”\\nShe told Eumaeus he should set\\nthe bow and pale-gray iron axes up\\nbefore the suitors, and in tears the swineherd \\ntook them, and did as she had asked. The cowherd\\nwept also when he saw his master’s bow.\\nAntinous began to scold and taunt them.\\nHe said, “You idiots! You tactless peasants!\\nSo thoughtless, so undisciplined! You fools,\\nyour selfish crying is upsetting her!\\nPoor lady, she is sad enough already\\nat losing her beloved husband. Sit\\nand eat in silence, or go do your wailing\\noutside, and leave us suitors here to try \\nthe deadly contest of the bow. I think\\nit will be diﬃcult; not one of us\\ncan match Odysseus. I saw him once\\nin childhood, and I still remember him.”\\nHe hoped he would be first to string the bow\\nand shoot through all the axes. But he would\\nbe first to taste an arrow from the hands\\nof great Odysseus, whom he had mocked,\\nurging the others on to do the same.\\nThen Prince Telemachus addressed them all. \\n“Zeus must have made me stupid! My dear mother,\\ndespite her usual common sense, has said\\nthat she will marry someone else and leave\\nthis house. But I am laughing, and my heart\\nfeels foolish gladness. Well, come on, you suitors.\\nYou want this prize—a woman unlike any\\nin holy Pylos, Argos or Mycenae,\\nor here in Ithaca or on the mainland.\\nNo woman in Achaea is like her.\\nThere is no need for me to praise my mother. \\nYou know her worth. So do not make excuses,\\ndo not put oﬀ the contest of the bow.\\nWe want to watch. And I will try myself.\\nIf I succeed in stringing it and shooting\\nall through, I will no longer mind if Mother\\ngoes oﬀ with someone else, and leaves me here.\\nSuccess would prove me man enough to carry\\nmy father’s arms.”\\nHe stood up straight and tall,\\ntossed oﬀ his purple cloak, unstrapped his sword,\\nand dug a trench to set the axes up, \\nall in a line, and trod the earth down flat.\\nThey were amazed to see him work so neatly,\\nthough he had never seen it done before.\\nHe stood astride the threshold and began\\nto try the bow. Three times his muscles trembled,\\nstraining to draw it back; three times he failed\\nto string the bow and shoot all through the axes.\\nHe would have tried a fourth time; he was keen\\nto keep on pulling. But Odysseus\\nshook his head, stopping him. Telemachus \\nsaid,\\n“Ugh! It seems that I will always be\\ntoo weak and useless. Or perhaps I am\\ntoo young and inexperienced at fighting\\nin self-defense when someone starts a quarrel.\\nYou all are stronger than I am. You try,\\nand we can end the contest.”\\nWith these words,\\nhe set the bow down on the floor, propped up\\nagainst the polished, jointed double door,\\nand tucked the arrow up against the handle.\\nHe sat back down where he had sat before. \\nAntinous called out, “Now, friends, get up,\\nfrom left to right, beginning with the man\\nnext to the wine-slave!”\\nThey agreed. The first\\nwas Leodes, their holy man, who always\\nsat in the farthest corner, by the wine-bowl.\\nHe was the only one who disapproved\\nof all their bullying. He grasped the bow\\nand stood astride the threshold, and he tried\\nto string it, but he failed. His hands were soft,\\nuntrained by labor, and he grew worn out \\ntrying to pull it back. He told the suitors,\\n“My friends, I cannot do it. Someone else\\nshould have a turn. This bow will take away\\ncourage, life-force, and energy from many\\nnoble young men; but better we should die,\\nthan live and lose the goal for which we gather\\nin this house every day. Each man still hopes\\nfor marriage with Odysseus’ wife,\\nPenelope. But if one tries and fails\\nto string the bow, let him go use his wealth \\nto court some other fine, well-dressed Greek lady.\\nAnd after that, Penelope will marry\\nwhichever man can bring most gifts for her—\\nthe man whom fate has chosen.”\\nWith these words,\\nhe set the bow back down, and leaned it up\\nagainst the polished, jointed double door,\\ntucking the pointed arrow by the handle.\\nAntinous responded with a jeer.\\n“My goodness, Leodes! What scary words!\\nAll your tough talk has made me really angry. \\nYou cannot string the bow, so you are claiming\\nthat it will take the life from proper men.\\nYou surely were not born for archery.\\nThe rest of us are actual warriors;\\nwe will soon string this bow.”\\nHe told the goatherd,\\n“Melanthius, come on now, light a fire\\nand pull a chair beside it, with a fleece,\\nand bring out from the pantry a big hunk\\nof fat, so we young men can warm the bow,\\ngrease it, and try it, and so end this contest.” \\nMelanthius obeyed at once; he lit\\na blazing fire, and pulled a chair beside it,\\nspreading a fleece on top, and brought the wheel\\nof fat. The young men warmed the bow, but still\\nthey could not string it. They were far too weak.\\nAntinous and Eurymachus, the leaders,\\nstrongest and most impressive of the suitors,\\nhad still not had their turn.\\nMeanwhile the swineherd\\nand cowherd had both gone outside the house.\\nOdysseus himself came after them, \\nand when they were outside the gates, beyond\\nthe courtyard, in a friendly voice he said,\\n“Cowherd and swineherd, I am hesitating\\nwhether to speak out openly; my impulse\\nis to be frank. What if some god should guide\\nOdysseus, and suddenly, as if\\nfrom nowhere, he was here—how would you act?\\nWould you be with the suitors, or with him?\\nHow are your hearts inclined?”\\nThe cowherd said,\\n“O Father Zeus, please make this wish come true, \\nthat he may come! May spirits guide him home!\\nThen you would see how well-prepared I am\\nto fight for him!” Eumaeus prayed in turn\\nthat all the gods would bring Odysseus\\nback home. The man who thought of everything now\\nknew\\ntheir minds, and said to them,\\n“I am here now.\\nI suﬀered terribly for twenty years,\\nand now I have come back to my own land.\\nI see that you two are the only slaves\\nwho welcome my arrival. I have not \\nheard any others praying I would come\\nback to my home. I promise, if some god\\nbrings down the noble suitors by my hands,\\nI will give each of you a wife and wealth,\\nand well-constructed houses, near my own.\\nYou two will be Telemachus’ brothers.\\nNow let me show you clearer proof, so you\\ncan know me well and trust me. See my scar,\\nmade by the boar’s white tusk, when I had gone\\nto hunt on Mount Parnassus with my cousins.” \\nSo saying, he pulled back his rags and showed\\nthe great big scar. They stared and studied it,\\nthen both burst into tears. They threw their arms\\naround Odysseus, and kissed his face\\nand hugged him, overjoyed at seeing him.\\nOdysseus embraced them back and kissed them.\\nThey would have wept till sunset, but he stopped them,\\nand said,\\n“Stop now; if someone steps outside\\nand sees you crying, they may tell the men.\\nGo in, not both at once but taking turns, \\nfirst me, then you, then you. And this will be\\nour sign: when all the noblemen refuse\\nto let me have the bow and set of arrows,\\nthen you must bring them through the hall, Eumaeus,\\nand put them in my hands. Command the women\\nto shut up tight the entrance to the hall,\\nand go to their own quarters; if they hear\\nmen screaming or loud noises, they must not\\ncome out, but stay there quietly, and work.\\nAnd you, Philoetius, lock up the gates \\nleading out from the courtyard with the bolt\\nand put the rope on too. We must move fast.”\\nWith that, he went inside, and sat back down\\non the same chair he sat on earlier.\\nThen the two slaves went in. Eurymachus\\nwas handling the bow and warming it,\\nturning it back and forth beside the fire.\\nBut even after that, he could not manage\\nto string it, and he groaned, and yelled in fury,\\n“This is disastrous! For all of us! \\nI do not even mind so much about\\nthe marriage. There are lots of other women\\non Ithaca, and in the other cities.\\nBut that we should be proven so much weaker\\nthan King Odysseus, that we should fail\\nto string his bow! Our deep humiliation\\nwill be well-known for many years to come!”\\nAntinous said, “No, Eurymachus,\\nit will not be like that, as you well know.\\nNo one should shoot a bow today; it is \\na feast day for Apollo! We should sit\\ncalmly and leave the axe heads standing there.\\nNo one will come and take them. Let the boy\\npour wine, so we can make drink oﬀerings,\\nand leave the bow for now. At dawn, call back\\nMelanthius, to bring the finest goats,\\nso we can make our oﬀerings to the god,\\nApollo, lord of archery, then try\\nthe bow again, and finish up the contest.”\\nThey all agreed with him. Attendants poured \\nwater to wash their hands, and boys began\\nto mix the wine in bowls, and poured a serving\\nin every cup, so they could make libations\\nand drink. Odysseus, the lord of lies,\\nhad carefully considered how to fool them.\\nHe said,\\n“Now hear me, suitors of the Queen;\\nlet me reveal the promptings of my heart.\\nEurymachus and Lord Antinous,\\nI ask you specially, because you spoke\\nso well: now set the bow aside, and turn \\ntowards the gods. At dawn, the god will choose\\nthe victor and give him success. For now,\\ngive me the polished bow, so I can try\\nmy strength and find out if my hands still have\\nthe suppleness and vigor of my youth,\\nor if it has been lost in all my years\\nof homelessness and poverty.”\\nThey bristled,\\nnervous in case he strung the polished bow.\\nAntinous said, “Foreigner! You fool!\\nAre you not grateful that we let you stay here \\nand eat with noblemen like us, and share\\nour feast, and hear us talk? No other beggars\\ncan hear our conversation. This good wine\\nhas made you drunk. It does have that eﬀect\\non those who gulp and fail to pace themselves.\\nWine even turned the famous Centaur’s head.\\nWhen Eurytion visited the Lapiths,\\ninside the house of brave Pirithous\\nthe wine made him go crazy, and he did\\nterrible things. The warriors were outraged, \\nand dragged him from the house. Their ruthless swords\\ncut oﬀ his ears and cropped his nose right oﬀ.\\nHe wandered, still insane and blown about\\nby gusts of madness. From that day, the Centaurs\\nand humans have been enemies. His drinking\\nwas harmful to himself. If you should string\\nthat bow, it would be worse for you. No man\\nwill treat you kindly in our house. We will\\nsend you by ship to Echetus, the king\\nof cruelty; you will find no escape. \\nSit quietly, drink up, and do not quarrel\\nwith younger men.”\\nAstute Penelope\\nsaid, “No, Antinous, it is not right\\nto disrespect a guest Telemachus\\nhas welcomed to this house. And do you think\\nthat if this stranger’s hands were strong enough\\nto string the bow, he would take me away\\nto marry him and live with him? Of course not!\\nHe does not even dream of such a thing.\\nNo need to spoil the feast by worrying \\nabout such things; there is no need of that.”\\nEurymachus said, “Shrewd Penelope,\\nit is indeed unlikely that this man\\nwould marry you. But we would feel ashamed\\nif some rude person said, ‘Those men are weak!\\nThey court a fighter’s wife, but cannot string\\nhis bow! Some random beggar has shown up\\nand strung it easily, and shot right through\\nall of the axes!’ They will talk like that,\\nand we will be humiliated!”\\nCalmly, \\nPenelope replied, “Eurymachus,\\npeople who waste the riches of a king\\nhave lost their dignity. Why fuss at this?\\nThe stranger is quite tall and muscular;\\nhis father must be noble. Go on, give him\\nthe bow, and let us watch. I tell you, if\\nhe strings it by the blessing of Apollo,\\nI will give him a proper cloak and tunic,\\nfine clothes and sandals, and a two-edged sword\\nand dagger, sharp enough to ward away \\nboth men and dogs, and I will help him go\\nwherever he desires to go.”\\nWith quick\\nintake of breath, Telemachus replied,\\n“No, Mother, no one has a better right\\nthan I to give the bow to anyone\\nor to refuse it. No one on this island\\nor out towards the pasturelands of Elis,\\nand no man in this house can force my hand,\\neven if I should choose to give the bow\\nto him to take away. Go up and work \\nwith loom and distaﬀ; tell your girls the same.\\nThe bow is work for men, especially me.\\nI am the one with power in this house.”\\nShe was amazed, and went back to her room,\\ntaking to heart her son’s assertive words.\\nInside her bedroom with her girls, she wept\\nfor her dear husband, her Odysseus,\\nuntil clear-eyed Athena let her sleep.\\nMeanwhile, the swineherd lifted up the bow.\\nThe suitors made an uproar.\\n“Dirty pig-man! \\nWhere are you taking it? Are you insane?\\nThe dogs you raised yourself will eat you up\\nwhen you are out there with your pigs alone,\\nif we find favor with Apollo and\\nthe other deathless gods.”\\nHe was afraid,\\nbecause there were so many people shouting\\ninside the hall, and set the bow he carried\\ndown on the ground. Telemachus called out,\\nin forceful tones.\\n“No, Grandpa! Keep on going!\\nKeep carrying the bow! You will soon see \\nyou have to choose which master to obey.\\nThough I am younger than you, I am stronger;\\nwatch out, or I will chase you to the fields,\\npelting your back with stones. I wish I had\\nan equal edge on all those who invaded\\nmy home to court my mother and make mischief.\\nI would soon throw them out and make them pay!”\\nAt that, the suitors all began to laugh;\\ntheir anger at Telemachus was gone.\\nEumaeus went across the hall and gave \\nthe bow to competent Odysseus.\\nAnd then he summoned Eurycleia, saying,\\n“Telemachus gave orders you must lock\\nthe doors into the hall and tie them fast.\\nIf any of you women hear a noise\\nof screaming men, stay up there in your quarters;\\ndo not come out; keep quiet and keep working.”\\nAt that, she held her tongue and locked the doors\\nthat led into the feast-hall. Philoetius\\nscurried outside to bolt the outer gates \\nthat led into the courtyard. On the porch\\nlay a fresh-knotted cable made of byblos;\\nwith that, he tied the gates, rushed in and sat\\nback down, and looked towards Odysseus.\\nThe master was already handling\\nthe bow and turning it this way and that,\\nto see if worms had eaten at the horn\\nwhile he was gone. The suitors told each other,\\n“He stares at it as if he were an expert\\nin bows. He acts the part! Perhaps he has \\na bow like this at home or plans to make one.\\nSee how this pitiful migrant fingers it!”\\nOne confident young suitor said, “I hope\\nhis future luck will match how well he does\\nin stringing it!”\\nSo he had tricked them all.\\nAfter examining the mighty bow\\ncarefully, inch by inch—as easily\\nas an experienced musician stretches\\na sheep-gut string around a lyre’s peg\\nand makes it fast—Odysseus, with ease, \\nstrung the great bow. He held it in his right hand\\nand plucked the string, which sang like swallow-song,\\na clear sweet note. The suitors, horrified,\\ngrew pale, and Zeus made ominous thunder rumble.\\nOdysseus, who had so long been waiting,\\nwas glad to hear the signal from the son\\nof double-dealing Cronus. He took up\\nan arrow, which was lying on the table.\\nThe others were all packed up in the quiver,\\nsoon to be used. He laid it on the bridge, \\nthen pulled the notch-end and the string together,\\nstill sitting in his chair. With careful aim,\\nhe shot. The weighted tip of bronze flew through\\neach axe head and then out the other side.\\nHe told his son,\\n“Telemachus, your guest\\ndoes you a credit. I hit all the targets\\nand with no eﬀort strung the bow. I am\\nstill strong, despite their jibes about my weakness.\\nThough it is daytime, it is time to feast;\\nand later, we can celebrate with music, \\nthe joyful part of dinner.”\\nWith his eyebrows\\nhe signaled, and his son strapped on his sword,\\npicked up his spear, and stood beside his chair,\\nnext to his father, his bronze weapons flashing.\\nBOOK \\nBloodshed\\nOdysseus ripped oﬀ his rags. Now naked,\\nhe leapt upon the threshold with his bow\\nand quiverfull of arrows, which he tipped\\nout in a rush before his feet, and spoke.\\n“Playtime is over. I will shoot again,\\ntowards another mark no man has hit.\\nApollo, may I manage it!”\\nHe aimed\\nhis deadly arrow at Antinous.\\nThe young man sat there, just about to lift\\nhis golden goblet, swirling wine around, \\nready to drink. He had no thought of death.\\nHow could he? Who would think a single man,\\namong so many banqueters, would dare\\nto risk dark death, however strong he was?\\nOdysseus aimed at his throat, then shot.\\nThe point pierced all the way through his soft neck.\\nHe flopped down to the side and his cup slipped\\nout of his hand, and then thick streams of blood\\ngushed from his nostrils. His foot twitched and knocked\\nthe table down; food scattered on the ground. \\nThe bread and roasted meat were soiled with blood.\\nSeeing him fall, the suitors, in an uproar,\\nwith shouts that filled the hall, jumped up and rushed\\nto search around by all the thick stone walls\\nfor shields or swords to grab—but there were none.\\nThey angrily rebuked Odysseus.\\n“Stranger, you shot a man, and you will pay!\\nYou will join no more games—you have to die!\\nFor certain! You have killed the best young man\\nin all of Ithaca. Right here, the vultures \\nwill eat your corpse.” Those poor fools did not know\\nthat he had killed Antinous on purpose,\\nnor that the snares of death were round them all.\\nClever Odysseus scowled back and sneered,\\n“Dogs! So you thought I would not come back home\\nfrom Troy? And so you fleeced my house, and raped\\nmy slave girls, and you flirted with my wife\\nwhile I am still alive! You did not fear\\nthe gods who live in heaven, and you thought\\nno man would ever come to take revenge. \\nNow you are trapped inside the snares of death.”\\nAt that, pale fear seized all of them. They groped\\nto find a way to save their lives somehow.\\nOnly Eurymachus found words to answer.\\n“If it is you, Odysseus, come back,\\nthen we agree! Quite right, the Greeks have done\\noutrageous things to your estate and home.\\nBut now the one responsible is dead—\\nAntinous! It was all his idea.\\nHe did not even really want your wife, \\nbut had another plan, which Zeus has foiled:\\nto lie in ambush for your son, and kill him,\\nthen seize the throne and rule in Ithaca.\\nNow he is slain—quite rightly. Please, my lord,\\nhave mercy on your people! We will pay\\nin public, yes, for all the food and drink.\\nWe each will bring the price of twenty oxen,\\nand pay you all the gold and bronze you want.\\nYour anger is quite understandable.”\\nOdysseus saw through him; with a glare \\nhe told him, “Even if you give me all\\nyour whole inheritance, and even more,\\nI will not keep my hands away from slaughter\\nuntil I pay you suitors back for all\\nyour wickedness. You have two choices: fight,\\nor run away: just try to save your lives!\\nNot one of you will get away from death.”\\nAt that their knees grew weak, their hearts stopped still.\\nEurymachus again addressed the suitors.\\n“My friends, this man will not hold back his hands. \\nSeizing the bow and arrows, he will shoot us\\nright from that polished threshold, till he kills\\neach one of us. Be quick, make plans for battle.\\nDraw out your swords, use tables as your shields\\nagainst the deadly arrows. All together,\\nrush at him, try to drive him oﬀ the threshold,\\nand out of doors, then run all through the town,\\nand quickly call for help. This man will soon\\nhave shot his last!”\\nHe drew his sharp bronze sword\\nand with a dreadful scream he leapt at him. \\nBut that same instant, Lord Odysseus\\nlet fly and hit his chest, beside the nipple,\\nand instantly the arrow pierced his liver.\\nThe sword fell from his hand. He doubled up\\nand fell across the table, spilling food\\nand wine across the floor. He smashed his head\\nagainst the ground, and in his desperate pain\\nkicked up the chair, and darkness drenched his eyes.\\nAmphinomus attacked Odysseus.\\nHe drew his sharp sword, hoping he could force him \\nto yield his place. Telemachus leapt in\\nand thrust his bronze spear through him from behind,\\nramming it through his back and out his chest.\\nFace-first he crashed and thudded to the ground.\\nTelemachus dashed back—he left his spear\\nstuck in the body; he was terrified\\nthat if he bent to pull it out, some Greek\\nwould jump on him and stab him with a sword.\\nHe ran and quickly reached his loyal father.\\nHe stood beside him and his words flew out. \\n“Now Father, I will fetch a shield for you\\nand two spears and a helmet made of bronze,\\nand I will arm myself, and bring more arms\\nfor our two herdsmen, since we all need weapons.”\\nOdysseus, the master planner, answered,\\n“Run fast while I still have a stock of arrows,\\nbefore they force me from the doors—I am\\nfighting alone up here.”\\nHis son obeyed.\\nHe hurried to the storeroom for the arms,\\nand took eight spears, four shields, and four bronze\\nhelmets \\neach fitted out with bushy horsehair plumes.\\nHe hurried back to take them to his father,\\nand was the first to strap the armor on.\\nThe two slaves also armed themselves, and stood\\nflanking their brilliant, resourceful leader.\\nAs long as he had arrows, he kept shooting,\\nand one by one he picked the suitors oﬀ,\\ninside his own home. Then at last the king\\nran out of arrows; he set down his bow\\nnext to the sturdy doorpost, leaning up \\nagainst the palace walls, all shining white.\\nHe slung the four-fold shield across his shoulders,\\nand put the well-made helmet on his head.\\nThe crest of horsehair gave a fearsome nod.\\nHe grasped a bronze-tipped spear in either hand.\\nThere was a back gate in the castle walls,\\nproviding access to the passageway,\\nwith tightly fitted doors. Odysseus\\nordered the noble swineherd to stand there\\nto guard it—there was only one way out. \\nAgelaus called out to all the suitors.\\n“Friends, one of us should slip out through that gate\\nand quickly tell the people, raise alarms.\\nThat soon would put a stop to this man’s shooting.”\\nMelanthius the goatherd answered, “No!\\nMy lord, that entryway is much too narrow,\\nand dangerously near the palace doors.\\nOne man, if he was brave, could keep it guarded\\nagainst us all. So I will bring you armor\\nout of the storeroom, which I think is where \\nthose two, our enemies, have hidden it.”\\nMelanthius the goatherd climbed up past\\nthe arrow-slits inside the castle walls,\\ninto the chamber. There he took twelve shields,\\ntwelve spears and twelve bronze helmets, each one\\ncrested\\nwith horsehair. Then he hurried back downstairs\\nand handed all the weapons to the suitors.\\nOdysseus could see that they had arms;\\ntheir spears were brandished. His heart stopped, his legs\\ntrembled—he was so shocked at their presumption. \\nAt once his words flew out to tell his son,\\n“One of the women, or Melanthius,\\nis waging war against us, in my house!”\\nWisely Telemachus owned up at once.\\n“Father, it was my fault, I am to blame.\\nI left the heavy storeroom door ajar.\\nSomeone on their side must have kept good watch.\\nGo there, Eumaeus, shut the door, and see\\nif any of the women are against us,\\nor else, as I suspect, Melanthius.” \\nMeanwhile, Melanthius was going back\\nto get more weapons from the room. The swineherd\\nsaw him and told Odysseus,\\n“My Lord,\\nthat little sneak, the man we all suspected,\\nis going to the stores! Odysseus,\\nyou always have a plan for what to do:\\nso should I kill him, as I think is best,\\nor bring him here to you, so you can punish\\nhis many crimes against you in your house?”\\nOdysseus already had a plan. \\n“Telemachus and I will keep the suitors\\ntrapped in the hall—however much they rage.\\nYou two, truss up his hands and feet behind him,\\ndrag him inside the storeroom, string him up,\\ntying a knotted rope high on the column,\\nand hoist him to the rafters. Torture him\\nwith hours of agony before he dies.”\\nHis word was their command; they hurried oﬀ,\\nand reached the weaponry. Melanthius\\nwas unaware of them. As he was searching \\nfor arms, they stopped on each side of the door\\nand waited. When he stepped across the threshold,\\nholding a lovely helmet in one hand,\\nand in the other hand, a rusty shield,\\nonce carried by Laertes in his youth,\\nbut now in storage, with its seams all loose.\\nThe two men jumped on him and grabbed his hair\\nto drag him in and threw him on the floor,\\nshaking with fear. They bound his hands and feet\\nand yanked them painfully behind his back, \\njust as the lord of suﬀering had told them.\\nThey tied him with a knotted rope and hoisted\\nhis body up the column to the rafters.\\nSwineherd Eumaeus, you began to mock him:\\n“Keep watch the whole night through, Melanthius,\\ntucked up in this soft bed—it serves you right!\\nAnd wait there for the golden throne of Dawn\\nleaving the sea, that hour when you would lead\\nyour goats to this house for the suitors’ dinner.”\\nThere he was left, bound cruelly and stretched. \\nThe herdsmen armed themselves and left the room,\\nshutting the door, and joined their cunning leader.\\nThey stood there on the threshold, tense with purpose,\\njust four against so many men inside.\\nThe child of Zeus, Athena, came to meet them;\\nher voice and looks resembled those of Mentor.\\nOdysseus was happy when he saw her,\\nand said, “Remember our old friendship, Mentor!\\nI have been good to you since we were boys.\\nSo help me now!” He guessed it was Athena, \\nwho rouses armies.\\nFrom the hall, the suitors\\nshouted their opposition. Agelaus\\ncalled, “Mentor, do not let Odysseus\\nsway you to help him and to fight against us.\\nI think this is how things will go. When we\\nhave killed this father and his son, you will\\ndie also, if you do as you intend,\\nand pay with your own life for all your plots.\\nOur bronze will strip your life away from you,\\nand we will seize whatever you may own \\nand mix it with the loot we get from here.\\nYour sons will not survive here in these halls,\\nnor will your wife and daughters still walk free\\nin Ithaca.”\\nAt that Athena’s heart\\nbecame enraged, and angrily she scolded\\nOdysseus. “Where is your courage now?\\nYou fought nine years on end against the Trojans,\\nfor white-armed Helen, Zeus’ favorite child.\\nYou slaughtered many men when war was raging,\\nand formed the plan that made the city fall. \\nNow you are home at last, how can you flinch\\nfrom being brave and using proper force\\nagainst these suitors? Come now, stand by me\\nand watch how Mentor, son of Alcimus,\\nwill treat your enemies as recompense\\nfor all your service.”\\nBut she did not grant\\ndecisive victory; she kept on testing\\nOdysseus’ courage, and his son’s.\\nShe flew up like a swallow through the smoke\\nand nestled in the rafters of the roof. \\nNow Agelaus, Demoptolemus,\\nEurynomus, Pisander, Amphimedon,\\nand Polybus were urging on the suitors.\\nThose were the most heroic of the group\\nwho still survived and battled for their lives:\\nthe others were defeated by the bow\\nand raining arrows. Agelaus told them,\\n“That Mentor’s boasts were empty, friends! He left,\\nand they are all alone there at the entrance.\\nNow force this cruel man to stay his hands. \\nDo not hurl spears at him all in a mass,\\nbut you six must shoot first and pray Lord Zeus\\nwe strike Odysseus and win the fight.\\nOnce he is down, the others will be nothing.”\\nThe six men threw their spears as he had said;\\nat once Athena made their eﬀorts fail.\\nOne pierced the doorpost of the palace hall,\\nanother hit the closely fitted door,\\nanother’s spear of ash and heavy bronze\\nfell on the wall. The group of four avoided \\nall of the suitors’ spears. Odysseus\\nhad waited long enough.\\n“My friends,” he said,\\n“they want to slaughter us and strip our arms!\\nAvenge my former wrongs, and save your lives!\\nNow shoot!”\\nThey hurled their spears at once and hit.\\nOdysseus killed Demoptolemus;\\nTelemachus, Euryades; the swineherd\\nslaughtered Elatus, and the cowherd killed\\nPisander. They all fell and bit the earth.\\nThe other suitors huddled in a corner; \\nthe four rushed up and from the corpses pulled\\ntheir spears. Again the suitors threw their weapons;\\nagain Athena made them fail. One spear\\nstruck at the doorpost, and another pierced\\nthe door; another ash spear hit the wall.\\nAmphimedon’s blow grazed Telemachus\\nright by the wrist: the bronze tore through his skin.\\nCtesippus hurled his spear; it only scratched\\nthe swineherd’s shoulder, just above his shield,\\nflew past and fell down on the floor behind him. \\nThe competent, sharp-eyed Odysseus\\nand his companions hurled their piercing spears\\ninto the swarming throng. The city-sacker\\nskewered Eurydamas; Telemachus\\nslashed Amphimedon, and the swineherd struck\\nat Polybus; the cowherd sliced right through\\nCtesippus’ chest, and crowed,\\n“You fool! You loved\\ninsulting us—now you have stopped your boasting.\\nThe gods have got the last word; they have won.\\nThis is a gift to pay you for that kick \\nyou gave Odysseus when he walked through\\nhis own house, as a homeless man in need.”\\nOdysseus moved closer with his spear,\\nand pierced Agelaus; Telemachus\\nthrust at Leocritus, and drove his bronze\\ninto his belly. He fell down headfirst,\\nface smashed against the floor.\\nThen from the roof\\nAthena lifted high her deadly aegis.\\nThe frightened suitors bolted through the hall\\nlike cattle, roused and driven by a gadfly \\nin springtime, when the days are getting longer.\\nAs vultures with their crooked beaks and talons\\nswoop from the hills and pounce on smaller birds\\nthat fly across the fields beneath the clouds;\\nthe victims have no help and no way out,\\nas their attackers slaughter them, and men\\nwatch and enjoy the violence. So these\\nfour fighters sprang and struck, and drove the suitors\\nin all directions. Screaming filled the hall,\\nas skulls were cracked; the whole floor ran with blood. \\nLeodes darted up to supplicate\\nOdysseus; he touched his knees.\\n“Please, mercy!\\nI did no wrong, I swear, in word or deed\\nto any of the women in the house.\\nI tried to stop the suitors, tried to urge them\\nto keep their hands clean, but they would not listen.\\nThose fools deserved their fate. But I did nothing!\\nI am a priest—yet I must lie with them.\\nWill good behavior go unrewarded?”\\nThe calculating hero scowled at him. \\n“If, as you claim, you sacrificed for them,\\nyou must have often prayed here in my hall\\nthat I would not regain the joys of home,\\nand that my wife would marry you instead,\\nand bear you children. You will not escape.\\nSuﬀer and die!”\\nAgelaus had dropped\\nhis sword when he was killed. With his strong arm\\nOdysseus swung, slashed down and sliced right through\\nthe priest’s neck, and his head, still framing words,\\nrolled in the dust.\\nThe poet Phemius, \\nwho had been forced to sing to please the suitors,\\nwas huddling by the back door with his lyre,\\nanxiously considering his choices:\\nto slip outside and crouch beneath the altar\\nof mighty Zeus, the god of home owners,\\nwhere his old masters burned so many thigh-bones;\\nor he could run towards Odysseus\\nand grasp him by the knees and beg for mercy.\\nHe made his mind up: he would supplicate.\\nHe set his hollow lyre on the ground \\nbetween the mixing bowl and silver chair,\\nand dashed to take Odysseus’ knees,\\nbeseeching him in quivering winged words.\\n“I beg you, Lord Odysseus! Have mercy!\\nThink! If you kill me now, you will be sorry!\\nI have the power to sing for gods and men.\\nI am self-taught—all kinds of song are planted\\nby gods inside my heart. I am prepared\\nto sing for you, as if before a god.\\nWait, do not cut my throat! Just ask your son! \\nHe will explain it was against my will\\nthat I came here to sing to them after dinner.\\nThey were too fierce and they outnumbered me.\\nI had no choice.”\\nThen strong Telemachus\\nturned quickly to his father, saying, “Stop,\\nhold up your sword—this man is innocent.\\nAnd let us also save the house boy, Medon.\\nHe always cared for me when I was young—\\nunless the herdsmen have already killed him,\\nor he already met you in your rage.” \\nMedon was sensible: he had been hiding\\nunder a chair, beneath a fresh cowhide,\\nin order to escape from being killed.\\nHearing these words, he jumped up from the chair,\\ntook oﬀ the cowhide and assumed the pose\\nof supplication near Telemachus,\\nand said,\\n“Friend, here I am! Please spare my life!\\nYour father is too strong, and furious\\nagainst the suitors, who skimmed oﬀ his wealth\\nand failed to honor you. Please, talk to him!” \\nCanny Odysseus smiled down and said,\\n“You need not worry, he has saved your life.\\nSo live and spread the word that doing good\\nis far superior to wickedness.\\nNow leave the hall and go outside; sit down,\\njoining the famous singer in the courtyard,\\nso I can finish what I have to do\\ninside my house.”\\nThe two men went outside,\\nand crouched by Zeus’ altar, on the lookout\\nfor death at any moment all around. \\nOdysseus scanned all around his home\\nfor any man who might be still alive,\\nwho might be hiding to escape destruction.\\nHe saw them fallen, all of them, so many,\\nlying in blood and dust, like fish hauled up\\nout of the dark-gray sea in fine-mesh nets;\\ntipped out upon the curving beach’s sand,\\nthey gasp for water from the salty sea.\\nSo lay the suitors, heaped across each other.\\nOdysseus, still scheming, told his son, \\n“I need to say something to Eurycleia.\\nHurry, Telemachus, and bring her here.”\\nTelemachus was glad to please his father.\\nHe pushed the door ajar and called the nurse.\\n“Nanny, come quick! You have been here for years.\\nYou supervise the female palace slaves.\\nMy father has to talk to you; come on!”\\nShe had no words to answer him, but opened\\nthe doors into the great and sturdy hall.\\nTelemachus went first and led the way. \\nAmong the corpses of the slaughtered men\\nshe saw Odysseus all smeared with blood.\\nAfter a lion eats a grazing ox,\\nits chest and jowls are thick with blood all over;\\na dreadful sight. Just so, Odysseus\\nhad blood all over him—from hands to feet.\\nSeeing the corpses, seeing all that blood,\\nso great a deed of violence, she began\\nto crow. Odysseus told her to stop\\nand spoke with fluent words.\\n“Old woman, no! \\nBe glad inside your heart, but do not shout.\\nIt is not pious, gloating over men\\nwho have been killed. Divine fate took them down,\\nand their own wicked deeds. They disrespected\\nall people that they met, both bad and good.\\nThrough their own crimes they came to this bad end.\\nBut tell me now about the household women.\\nWhich ones dishonor me? And which are pure?”\\nThe slave who loved her master answered, “Child,\\nI will tell you exactly how things stand. \\nIn this house we have fifty female slaves\\nwhom we have trained to work, to card the wool,\\nand taught to tolerate their life as slaves.\\nTwelve stepped away from honor: those twelve girls\\nignore me, and Penelope our mistress.\\nShe would not let Telemachus instruct them,\\nsince he is young and only just grown-up.\\nLet me go upstairs to the women’s rooms,\\nto tell your wife—some god has sent her sleep.”\\nThe master strategist Odysseus \\nsaid,\\n“Not yet; do not wake her. Call the women\\nwho made those treasonous plots while I was gone.”\\nThe old nurse did so. Walking through the hall,\\nshe called the girls. Meanwhile, Odysseus\\nsummoned the herdsmen and Telemachus\\nand spoke winged words to them.\\n“Now we must start\\nto clear the corpses out. The girls must help.\\nThen clean my stately chairs and handsome tables\\nwith sponges fine as honeycomb, and water.\\nWhen the whole house is set in proper order, \\nrestore my halls to health: take out the girls\\nbetween the courtyard wall and the rotunda.\\nHack at them with long swords, eradicate\\nall life from them. They will forget the things\\nthe suitors made them do with them in secret,\\nthrough Aphrodite.”\\nSobbing desperately\\nthe girls came, weeping, clutching at each other.\\nThey carried out the bodies of the dead\\nand piled them up on top of one another,\\nunder the roof outside. Odysseus \\ninstructed them and forced them to continue.\\nAnd then they cleaned his lovely chairs and tables\\nwith wet absorbent sponges, while the prince\\nand herdsmen with their shovels scraped away\\nthe mess to make the sturdy floor all clean.\\nThe girls picked up the trash and took it out.\\nThe men created order in the house\\nand set it all to rights, then led the girls\\noutside and trapped them—they could not escape—\\nbetween the courtyard wall and the rotunda. \\nShowing initiative, Telemachus\\ninsisted,\\n“I refuse to grant these girls\\na clean death, since they poured down shame on me\\nand Mother, when they lay beside the suitors.”\\nAt that, he wound a piece of sailor’s rope\\nround the rotunda and round the mighty pillar,\\nstretched up so high no foot could touch the ground.\\nAs doves or thrushes spread their wings to fly\\nhome to their nests, but someone sets a trap—\\nthey crash into a net, a bitter bedtime; \\njust so the girls, their heads all in a row,\\nwere strung up with the noose around their necks\\nto make their death an agony. They gasped,\\nfeet twitching for a while, but not for long.\\nThen the men took Melanthius outside\\nand with curved bronze cut oﬀ his nose and ears\\nand ripped away his genitals, to feed\\nraw to the dogs. Still full of rage, they chopped\\nhis hands and feet oﬀ. Then they washed their own,\\nand they went back inside.\\nOdysseus \\ntold his beloved nurse, “Now bring me fire\\nand sulfur, as a cure for evil things,\\nand I will fumigate the house. And call\\nPenelope, her slaves, and all the slave girls\\ninside the house.”\\nShe answered with aﬀection,\\n“Yes, dear, all this is good. But let me bring\\na cloak and shirt for you. You should not stand here\\nyour strong back covered only with those rags.\\nThat would be wrong!”\\nOdysseus, the master\\nof every cunning scheme, replied, “No, first \\nI need a fire here, to smoke the hall.”\\nHis loving slave complied and brought the fire\\nand sulfur, and Odysseus made smoke,\\nand fumigated every room inside\\nthe house and yard. Meanwhile, the old nurse ran\\nall through the palace summoning the women.\\nBy torchlight they came out from their apartments,\\nto greet Odysseus with open arms.\\nThey kissed his face and took him by the hands\\nin welcome. He was seized by sweet desire \\nto weep, and in his heart he knew them all.\\nBOOK \\nThe Olive Tree Bed\\nChuckling with glee, the old slave climbed upstairs\\nto tell the queen that her beloved husband\\nwas home. Her weak old knees felt stronger now;\\nwith buoyant steps she went and stood beside\\nher mistress, at her head, and said,\\n“Dear child,\\nwake up and see! At long last you have got\\nyour wish come true! Odysseus has come!\\nHe is right here inside this house! At last!\\nHe slaughtered all the suitors who were wasting\\nhis property and threatening his son!” \\nBut cautiously Penelope replied,\\n“You poor old thing! The gods have made you crazy.\\nThey have the power to turn the sanest person\\nmad, or make fools turn wise. You used to be\\nso sensible, but they have damaged you.\\nWhy else would you be mocking me like this,\\nwith silly stories, in my time of grief?\\nWhy did you wake me from the sleep that sweetly\\nwrapped round my eyes? I have not slept so soundly\\nsince my Odysseus marched oﬀ to see \\nthat cursed town—Evilium. Go back!\\nIf any other slave comes here to wake me\\nand tell me all this nonsense, I will send her\\nback down at once, and I will not be gentle.\\nYour old age will protect you from worse scolding.”\\nBut Eurycleia answered with aﬀection,\\n“Dear child, I am not mocking you. I am\\ntelling the truth: Odysseus is here!\\nHe is the stranger that they all abused.\\nTelemachus has known for quite some time, \\nbut sensibly he kept his father’s plans\\na secret, so Odysseus could take\\nrevenge for all their violence and pride.”\\nPenelope was overjoyed; she jumped\\nfrom bed and hugged the nurse, and started crying.\\nHer words flew fast.\\n“Dear Nanny! If this is\\nthe truth, if he has come back to this house,\\nhow could he have attacked those shameless suitors,\\nwhen he is just one man, and there were always\\nso many crowded in there?”\\nEurycleia \\nanswered, “I did not see or learn the details.\\nI heard the sound of screaming from the men\\nas they were killed. We huddled in our room\\nand kept the doors tight shut, until your son\\ncalled me—his father sent him. Then I saw\\nOdysseus surrounded by dead bodies.\\nThey lay on top of one another, sprawled\\nacross the solid floor. You would have been\\nthrilled if you saw him, like a lion, drenched\\nin blood and gore. Now they are all piled up \\nout by the courtyard gates, and he is burning\\na mighty fire to fumigate the palace,\\nrestoring all its loveliness. He sent me\\nto fetch you. Come with me, so both of you\\ncan start to live in happiness. You have\\nendured such misery. Your wish came true!\\nHe is alive! He has come home again,\\nand found you and your son, and he has taken\\nrevenge on all the suitors who abused him.”\\nPenelope said carefully, “Do not \\nstart gloating. As you know, my son and I\\nwould be delighted if he came. We all would.\\nHowever, what you say cannot be true.\\nSome god has killed the suitors out of anger\\nat their abuse of power and their pride.\\nThey failed to show respect to visitors,\\nboth good and bad. Their foolishness has killed them.\\nBut my Odysseus has lost his home,\\nand far away from Greece, he lost his life.”\\nThe nurse replied, “Dear child! How can you say \\nyour husband will not come, when he is here,\\nbeside the hearth? Your heart has always been\\nmistrustful. But I have clear evidence!\\nWhen I was washing him, I felt the scar\\nmade when the boar impaled him with its tusk.\\nI tried to tell you, but he grabbed my throat\\nand stopped me spoiling all his plans. Come with me.\\nI swear on my own life: if I am lying,\\nthen kill me.”\\nWise Penelope said, “Nanny,\\nit must be hard for you to understand \\nthe ways of gods, despite your cleverness.\\nBut let us go to meet my son, so I\\ncan see the suitors dead, and see the man\\nwho killed them.”\\nSo she went downstairs. Her heart\\ncould not decide if she should keep her distance\\nas she was questioning her own dear husband,\\nor go right up to him and kiss his face\\nand hold his hands in hers. She crossed the threshold\\nand sat across from him beside the wall,\\nin firelight. He sat beside the pillar, \\nand kept his eyes down, waiting to find out\\nwhether the woman who once shared his bed\\nwould speak to him. She sat in silence, stunned.\\nSometimes when she was glancing at his face\\nit seemed like him; but then his dirty clothes\\nwere unfamiliar. Telemachus\\nscolded her.\\n“Mother! Cruel, heartless Mother!\\nWhy are you doing this, rejecting Father?\\nWhy do you not go over, sit beside him,\\nand talk to him? No woman in the world \\nwould be so obstinate! To keep your distance\\nfrom him when he has come back after twenty\\nlong years of suﬀering! Your heart is always\\nharder than rock!”\\nBut thoughtfully she answered,\\n“My child, I am confused. I cannot speak,\\nor meet his eyes. If this is really him,\\nif my Odysseus has come back home,\\nwe have our ways to recognize each other,\\nthrough secret signs known only to us two.”\\nHardened Odysseus began to smile. \\nHe told the boy,\\n“You must allow your mother\\nto test me out; she will soon know me better.\\nWhile I am dirty, dressed in rags, she will not\\ntreat me with kindness or acknowledge me.\\nMeanwhile, we must make plans. If someone murders\\neven just one man, even one who had\\nfew friends in his community, the killer\\nis forced to run away and leave his homeland\\nand family. But we have killed the mainstay\\nof Ithaca, the island’s best young men. \\nSo what do you suggest?”\\nTelemachus\\nsaid warily, “You have to work it out.\\nThey say you have the finest mind in all\\nthe world; no mortal man can rival you\\nin cleverness. Lead me, and I will be\\nbehind you right away. And I will do\\nmy best to be as brave as I can be.”\\nOdysseus was quick to form a plan.\\nHe told him, “Here is what I think is best.\\nThe three of you should wash and change your clothes, \\nand make the slave girls go put on clean dresses.\\nThen let the godlike singer take the lyre\\nand play a clear and cheerful dancing tune,\\nso passersby or neighbors hearing it\\nwill think it is a wedding. We must not\\nallow the news about the suitors’ murder\\nto spread too far until we reach the woods\\nof our estate, and there we can decide\\nthe best path forward oﬀered us by Zeus.”\\nThey did as Lord Odysseus had said. \\nThey washed and changed their tunics, and the slave\\ngirls\\nprepared themselves. The singer took the lyre,\\nand roused in them desire to hear sweet music,\\nand dance. The house resounded with the thump\\nof beating feet from all the dancing men\\nand girls in pretty sashes. Those outside\\nwho heard the noises said to one another,\\n“So somebody is marrying the queen\\nwho had so many suitors! Headstrong woman!\\nShe must have lacked the strength to wait it out \\nand keep her husband’s house safe till he came.”\\nThey spoke with no idea what really happened.\\nEurynome the slave woman began\\nto wash strong-willed Odysseus. She rubbed him\\nwith olive oil, and dressed him in a tunic\\nand handsome cloak. And then Athena poured\\nattractiveness from head to toe, and made him\\ntaller and stronger, and his hair grew thick\\nand curly as a hyacinth. As when\\na craftsman whom Athena or Hephaestus \\nhas trained in metalwork, so he can make\\nbeautiful artifacts, pours gold on silver—\\nso she poured beauty on his head and shoulders.\\nAfter his bath he looked like an immortal.\\nHe sat down in the same chair opposite\\nhis wife and said,\\n“Extraordinary woman!\\nThe gods have given you the hardest heart.\\nNo other wife would so reject a husband\\nwho had been suﬀering for twenty years\\nand finally come home. Well, Nanny, make \\na bed for me, so I can rest. This woman\\nmust have an iron heart!”\\nPenelope\\nsaid shrewdly, “You extraordinary man!\\nI am not acting proud, or underplaying\\nthis big event; yet I am not surprised\\nat how you look. You looked like this the day\\nyour long oars sailed away from Ithaca.\\nNow, Eurycleia, make the bed for him\\noutside the room he built himself. Pull out\\nthe bedstead, and spread quilts and blankets on it.” \\nShe spoke to test him, and Odysseus\\nwas furious, and told his loyal wife,\\n“Woman! Your words have cut my heart! Who moved\\nmy bed? It would be diﬃcult for even\\na master craftsman—though a god could do it\\nwith ease. No man, however young and strong,\\ncould pry it out. There is a trick to how\\nthis bed was made. I made it, no one else.\\nInside the court there grew an olive tree\\nwith delicate long leaves, full-grown and green, \\nas sturdy as a pillar, and I built\\nthe room around it. I packed stones together,\\nand fixed a roof and fitted doors. At last\\nI trimmed the olive tree and used my bronze\\nto cut the branches oﬀ from root to tip\\nand planed it down and skillfully transformed\\nthe trunk into a bedpost. With a drill,\\nI bored right through it. This was my first bedpost,\\nand then I made the other three, inlaid\\nwith gold and silver and with ivory. \\nI stretched ox-leather straps across, dyed purple.\\nNow I have told the secret trick, the token.\\nBut woman, wife, I do not know if someone—\\na man—has cut the olive trunk and moved\\nmy bed, or if it is still safe.”\\nAt that,\\nher heart and body suddenly relaxed.\\nShe recognized the tokens he had shown her.\\nShe burst out crying and ran straight towards him\\nand threw her arms around him, kissed his face,\\nand said,\\n“Do not be angry at me now, \\nOdysseus! In every other way\\nyou are a very understanding man.\\nThe gods have made us suﬀer: they refused\\nto let us stay together and enjoy\\nour youth until we reached the edge of age\\ntogether. Please forgive me, do not keep\\nbearing a grudge because when I first saw you,\\nI would not welcome you immediately.\\nI felt a constant dread that some bad man\\nwould fool me with his lies. There are so many \\ndishonest, clever men. That foreigner\\nwould never have got Helen into bed,\\nif she had known the Greeks would march to war\\nand bring her home again. It was a goddess\\nwho made her do it, putting in her heart\\nthe passion that first caused my grief as well.\\nNow you have told the story of our bed,\\nthe secret that no other mortal knows,\\nexcept yourself and me, and just one slave,\\nActoris, whom my father gave to me \\nwhen I came here, who used to guard our room.\\nYou made my stubborn heart believe in you.”\\nThis made him want to cry. He held his love,\\nhis faithful wife, and wept. As welcome as\\nthe land to swimmers, when Poseidon wrecks\\ntheir ship at sea and breaks it with great waves\\nand driving winds; a few escape the sea\\nand reach the shore, their skin all caked with brine.\\nGrateful to be alive, they crawl to land.\\nSo glad she was to see her own dear husband, \\nand her white arms would not let go his neck.\\nThey would have wept until the rosy Dawn\\nbegan to touch the sky, but shining-eyed\\nAthena intervened. She held night back,\\nrestraining golden Dawn beside the Ocean,\\nand would not let her yoke her swift young colts,\\nShining and Bright. Odysseus, mind whirling,\\nsaid,\\n“Wife, we have not come yet to the end\\nof all our troubles; there are more to come,\\nmany hard labors which I must complete. \\nThe spirit of Tiresias informed me,\\nthat day I went inside the house of Hades\\nto ask about the journey home for me\\nand for my men. But come now, let us go\\nto bed together, wife; let us enjoy\\nthe pleasure of sweet sleep.”\\nPenelope,\\nwho always thought ahead, said, “When you wish.\\nThe bed is yours. The gods have brought you home,\\nback to your well-built house. But since a god\\nhas made you speak about these future labors, \\ntell me what they involve. I will find out\\neventually, and better to know now.”\\nHe answered warily, “You really are\\nextraordinary. Why would you make me tell you\\nsomething to cause you pain? It hurts me too,\\nbut I will tell the truth, not hide it from you.\\nTiresias foretold that I must travel\\nthrough many cities carrying an oar,\\ntill I reach men who do not know the sea,\\nand do not eat their food with salt, or use \\nboats painted red around the prow, or oars,\\nwhich are the wings of ships. He said that I\\nwill know I have arrived when I encounter\\nsomeone who calls the object on my back\\na winnowing fan. Then I must fix my oar\\nfirm in the earth, and make a sacrifice\\nto Lord Poseidon, of a ram and ox\\nand stud-boar, perfect animals, then come\\nback home and give a hecatomb to all\\nthe deathless gods who live above the sky. \\nIf I do this, I will not die at sea;\\nI will grow old in comfort and will meet\\na gentle death, surrounded by my people,\\nwho will be rich and happy.”\\nSensibly\\nPenelope said, “If the gods allow you\\nto reach old age in comfort, there is hope\\nthat there will be an end to all our troubles.”\\nThey talked like this. Meanwhile, the slaves were\\nworking:\\nEurynome and Eurycleia laid\\nsoft blankets on the sturdy bed by torchlight. \\nThe nurse went oﬀ to sleep, and Eurynome\\npicked up the torch and led them to their bed,\\nthen went to her room. Finally, at last,\\nwith joy the husband and the wife arrived\\nback in the rites of their old marriage bed.\\nMeanwhile, the herdsmen and Telemachus\\nstopped dancing, made the women stop, and went\\nto bed inside the darkened house.\\nAnd when\\nthe couple had enjoyed their lovemaking,\\nthey shared another pleasure—telling stories. \\nShe told him how she suﬀered as she watched\\nthe crowd of suitors ruining the house,\\nkilling so many herds of sheep and cattle\\nand drinking so much wine, because of her.\\nOdysseus told her how much he hurt\\nso many other people, and in turn\\nhow much he had endured himself. She loved\\nto listen, and she did not fall asleep\\nuntil he told it all. First, how he slaughtered\\nthe Cicones, then traveled to the fields \\nof Lotus-Eaters; what the Cyclops did,\\nand how he paid him back for ruthlessly\\neating his men. Then how he reached Aeolus,\\nwho welcomed him and helped him; but it was\\nnot yet his fate to come back home; a storm\\nsnatched him and bore him oﬀ across the sea,\\nhowling frustration. Then, he said, he came\\nto Laestrygonia, whose people wrecked\\nhis fleet and killed his men. And he described\\nthe cleverness of Circe, and his journey \\nto Hades to consult Tiresias,\\nand how he saw all his dead friends, and saw\\nhis mother, who had loved him as a baby;\\nthen how he heard the Sirens’ endless voices,\\nand reached the Wandering Rocks and terrible\\nCharybdis, and how he had been the first\\nto get away from Scylla. And he told her\\nof how his crew devoured the Sun God’s cattle;\\nZeus roared with smoke and thunder, lightning struck\\nthe ship, and all his loyal men were killed. \\nBut he survived, and drifted to Ogygia.\\nHe told her how Calypso trapped him there,\\ninside her hollow cave, and wanted him\\nto be her husband; she took care of him\\nand promised she could set him free from death\\nand time forever. But she never swayed\\nhis heart. He suﬀered terribly, for years,\\nand then he reached Phaeacia, where the people\\nlooked up to him as if he were a god,\\nand sent him in a ship back home again \\nto his dear Ithaca, with gifts of bronze\\nand gold and piles of clothes. His story ended;\\nsweet sleep released his heart from all his cares.\\nAthena, bright-eyed goddess, stayed alert,\\nand when she thought Odysseus had finished\\nwith taking pleasure in his wife and sleep,\\nshe roused the newborn Dawn from Ocean’s streams\\nto bring the golden light to those on earth.\\nOdysseus got up and told his wife,\\n“Wife, we have both endured our share of trouble: \\nyou wept here as you longed for my return,\\nwhile Zeus and other gods were keeping me\\naway from home, although I longed to come.\\nBut now we have returned to our own bed,\\nas we both longed to do. You must look after\\nmy property inside the house. Meanwhile,\\nI have to go on raids, to steal replacements\\nfor all the sheep those swaggering suitors killed,\\nand get the other Greeks to give me more,\\nuntil I fill my folds. But first I will \\ngo to the orchard in the countryside\\nto see my grieving father. Then at dawn\\nthe news will spread that I have killed the suitors.\\nYour orders, wife—though you are smart enough\\nto need no orders—are, go with your slaves\\nupstairs, sit quietly, and do not talk\\nto anyone.”\\nHe armed himself and called\\nthe herdsmen and Telemachus, and told them\\nto put on armor too—breastplates of bronze.\\nOdysseus led all of them outside. \\nThe light was bright across the earth. Athena\\nhid them with night and brought them out of town.\\nBOOK \\nRestless Spirits\\nThen Hermes called the spirits of the suitors\\nout of the house. He held the golden wand\\nwith which he casts a spell to close men’s eyes\\nor open those of sleepers when he wants.\\nHe led the spirits and they followed, squeaking\\nlike bats in secret crannies of a cave,\\nwho cling together, and when one becomes\\ndetached and falls down from the rock, the rest\\nflutter and squeak—just so the spirits squeaked,\\nand hurried after Hermes, lord of healing. \\nOn open roads they crossed the Ocean stream,\\nwent past the rock of Leucas and the gates\\nof Helius the Sun, and skittered through\\nthe provinces of dreams, and soon arrived\\nin fields of asphodel, the home of shadows\\nwho have been worn to weariness by life.\\nThey found Achilles’ ghost there, and Patroclus,\\nand Ajax, the most handsome of the Greeks\\nafter unmatched Achilles. Agamemnon\\nhad just arrived to join them, in deep grief \\nfor his own death, and with him came the others\\nkilled by Aegisthus and his bodyguards.\\nAchilles’ ghost spoke first.\\n“O Agamemnon!\\nMen used to say that out of all the heroes,\\nZeus, Lord of Lightning, favored you the most,\\nbecause you had command of a great army\\nin Troy where Greeks endured the pain of war.\\nBut death, which no man living can avoid,\\nwas destined to arrive at the wrong time.\\nIf only you had died at Troy and won \\nthe glory of your rank as a commander!\\nAll of the Greeks and allies would have built\\na tomb for you, and afterwards your son\\nwould have received great honor. As it is,\\nit was your fate to die a dreadful death.”\\nThe ghost of Agamemnon answered him,\\n“Achilles, son of Peleus, you were\\nlucky to die at Troy, away from Argos.\\nThe finest warriors of Greece and Troy\\nfought round your corpse and died. You lay a hero, \\nmagnificent amid the whirling dust,\\nyour days of driving chariots forgotten.\\nWe fought all day, and would have fought forever,\\nbut Zeus sent winds to stop us. Then we brought you\\nback to our ships, and laid you on a bier,\\naway from battle, and we bathed your skin\\nin heated water and anointed you\\nwith oil. We wept for you and cut our hair.\\nYour mother heard the news, and with her nymphs\\nshe came up from the waves. An eerie wailing \\nsounded across the sea. The men began\\nto tremble, and they would have rushed on board,\\nif wise old Nestor had not made them stop.\\nHe always had the best advice for us,\\nand said, ‘My lords, stay here. It is his mother,\\ncoming with her immortal water nymphs\\nto find her own dead son.’ At this, the Greeks\\nregained their courage. The old Sea King’s daughters\\ngathered around you weeping, and they dressed you\\nin clothes of the immortals. All nine Muses \\nsang lamentations in their lovely voices.\\nNo one could keep from crying at the sound,\\nso moving was their song. The gods and men\\nwere mourning seventeen long nights and days\\nand then we gave you to the pyre, and killed\\nmany fat sheep and cattle for your corpse.\\nYou burned in clothes from gods; you were anointed\\nwith oil and honey. Troops of warriors\\non foot and horseback, fully armed, went marching\\naround your pyre, and made a mighty din. \\nAt last Hephaestus’ flame consumed your flesh.\\nWhen morning came, we gathered your white bones,\\nAchilles, and anointed them with oil\\nand unmixed wine. Your mother gave an urn\\nof gold with double handles, which she said\\nHephaestus made and Dionysus gave her.\\nYour white bones lay inside it, Lord Achilles,\\nmixed with the bones of your dead friend Patroclus.\\nWe laid the urn beside Antilochus,\\nthe friend you most respected after him. \\nThe army of Greek warriors assembled,\\nand with all reverence we heaped a mound\\nout on the headland by the Hellespont,\\nlarge enough to be visible to those\\nat sea, both now and in the years to come.\\nYour mother asked the gods for splendid prizes\\nand put them in the midst of an arena,\\nso the best athletes could compete for them.\\nYou have seen many burials of heroes,\\nwhen young men tie their tunics to compete. \\nBut you would have been startled at the riches\\nthat silver-footed Thetis brought for you.\\nYou were so dearly loved by all the gods.\\nYou did not lose your name in death. Your fame\\nwill live forever; everyone will know\\nAchilles. As for me, what good was it\\nthat I wound up the war? When I came home\\nAegisthus and my wicked, fiendish wife\\nmurdered me. Zeus had planned it.”\\nWhile they talked,\\nHermes the guide came near them, with the suitors \\nkilled by Odysseus. The two great lords,\\nastonished at the sight, rushed up to them,\\nand Agamemnon’s spirit recognized\\nthe son of his old friend, Menelaus,\\nwith whom he stayed in Ithaca. He said,\\n“Amphimedon! What happened to you all?\\nWhy have you all come down here to the land\\nof darkness? You are all so young and strong;\\nyou must have been the best boys in your town.\\nMaybe Poseidon raised great waves and winds \\nto wreck your fleet? Or were you all attacked\\nby men on land while you were poaching cows\\nor flocks of sheep, or fighting for a city\\nand women? You must tell me! We are friends.\\nDo you remember when I visited\\nyour home, when Menelaus and myself\\nwere trying to persuade Odysseus\\nto join the fleet and sail with us to Troy?\\nIt took a whole damned month to cross the sea;\\nwe had to work so hard to sway that man, \\nwho sacked the city.”\\nAmphimedon’s spirit\\nanswered, “Great General, Agamemnon, yes,\\nI do remember everything you say.\\nAnd I will tell, in every gruesome detail,\\nthe manner of our death. Odysseus\\nwas gone for many years. We came to court\\nhis wife, who had no wish to marry us,\\nbut would not tell us no or make an end.\\nShe planned black death for us, and tricked us, too.\\nShe set a mighty loom up in the hall, \\nand wove a wide fine cloth, and said to us,\\n‘Young suitors, now Odysseus is dead.\\nI know that you are eager for the wedding,\\nbut wait till I am finished with this cloth,\\nso that my weaving will not go to waste.\\nIt is a shroud for when Laertes dies,\\nso that the women in the town do not\\nblame me because a man who gained such wealth\\nwas buried with no winding-sheet.’ Her words\\nconvinced us. So by day she wove the cloth, \\nand then at night by torchlight, she unwove it.\\nFor three long years she fooled us; when the hours\\nand months had passed, the fourth year rolled around,\\nand then a girl who knew the truth told us;\\nand we found her unraveling her work.\\nWe made her finish it. When she had washed\\nthe marvelous huge sheet, she showed it to us,\\nbright as the sun or moon. And then some spirit\\nof ruin brought Odysseus from somewhere\\nto Ithaca; he went out to the fields, \\nto where the swineherd lived. His own dear son\\nsailed in his black ship back from sandy Pylos.\\nThe two of them made plans to murder us.\\nThey showed up at the palace—first the boy,\\nand then Odysseus propped on a stick\\nand dressed in dirty rags. He seemed to be\\na poor old homeless man, who suddenly\\nappeared, led by the swineherd. None of us\\ncould recognize him, even those of us\\nwho were a little older than myself. \\nWe hurled insulting words and missiles at him,\\nand for a while he patiently endured\\nabuse in his own home. But when the will\\nof Zeus awakened him, with his son’s help,\\nhe put the splendid weapons in the storeroom\\nand locked the door. Then came his cunning plan:\\nhe told his wife to set for us the axes\\nand bow. The competition meant our doom,\\nthe start of slaughter. None of us could string\\nthe mighty bow—we all were far too weak. \\nBut when it was his turn, we shouted out\\nthat nobody should give the bow to him,\\nno matter what he said. Telemachus\\nalone insisted that he ought to have it.\\nAt last Odysseus, with calm composure,\\ntook it and strung it easily, and shot\\nall through the iron axes. Then he stood\\nastride the threshold with a fearsome scowl,\\nand started shooting fast. His arrow struck\\nAntinous, our leader. With sure aim \\nhe shot his deadly arrows at more men;\\nthose nearest to him fell. It was apparent\\nsome god was helping them. Impelled by rage,\\nthey rushed around the palace killing us\\nin turn. There was a dreadful noise of screaming\\nand broken skulls; the whole floor ran with blood.\\nSo, Agamemnon, we were killed. Our bodies\\nstill lie unburied in our killer’s house.\\nOur families at home do not yet know.\\nThey need to wash the black blood from our wounds \\nand weep for us and lay our bodies out.\\nThis is the honor due the dead.”\\nThe ghost\\nof Agamemnon answered, “Lucky you,\\ncunning Odysseus: you got yourself\\na wife of virtue—great Penelope.\\nHow principled she was, that she remembered\\nher husband all those years! Her fame will live\\nforever, and the deathless gods will make\\na poem to delight all those on earth\\nabout intelligent Penelope. \\nNot like my wife—who murdered her own husband!\\nHer story will be hateful; she will bring\\nbad reputation to all other women,\\neven the good ones.”\\nSo they spoke together,\\nstanding in Hades, hidden in the earth.\\nMeanwhile, Odysseus and his companions\\nhad left the town and quickly reached the farm,\\nwon by Laertes long ago—he fought\\nhard for it, and his house was there; the slaves,\\nwho had to do his wishes, lived and slept \\nand ate their food in quarters that surrounded\\nthe central house. One was from Sicily,\\nthe old slave woman who took care of him\\nout in the countryside. Odysseus\\nspoke to his slaves and to his son.\\n“Go in,\\nchoose the best pig and kill it for our dinner.\\nAnd I will test my father, to find out\\nif he will know me instantly on sight,\\nor not—I have been absent for so long.”\\nAt that he gave his weapons to the slaves. \\nThey quickly went inside. Odysseus\\nwalked to the fruitful orchard on his quest.\\nHe did not find old Dolius, the steward,\\nnor any of his slaves or sons—he had\\nled them to gather rocks to build dry-walls.\\nOdysseus’ father was alone,\\ninside the well-built orchard, digging earth\\nto make it level round a tree. He wore\\na dirty ragged tunic, and his leggings\\nhad leather patches to protect from scratches. \\nHe wore thick gloves because of thorns, and had\\na cap of goatskin. He was wallowing\\nin grief. The veteran, Odysseus,\\nseeing his father worn by age and burdened\\nby desperate, heartfelt sorrow, stopped beneath\\na towering pear tree, weeping. Then he wondered\\nwhether to kiss his father, twine around him,\\nand tell him that he had come home again,\\nand everything that happened on the way—\\nor question him. He thought it best to start \\nby testing him with teasing and abuse.\\nWith this in mind, Odysseus approached him,\\nas he was digging round the plant, head down.\\nHis famous son stood at his side and said,\\n“Old man, you know your trade and take good care\\nof this neat garden. Every plant and vine,\\nand tree—the figs, the pears, the olive trees—\\nand bed of herbs is nicely tended. But\\nI have to say something—please do not get\\nangry at me—you do not take good care \\nof your own self. You are unkempt, old man.\\nYour skin is rough and dirty and your clothes\\nare rags. Your master is neglecting you,\\nalthough you are not lazy. In your height\\nand face, you seem a leader, not a slave.\\nYou look like someone who would bathe and eat\\nand sleep on fluﬀy pillows and fine sheets,\\nas is appropriate for older people.\\nBut tell me this: whose slave are you? Whose garden\\ndo you take care of? Also, have I come \\nto Ithaca, as somebody I met\\nwas telling me just now? But he was not\\na helpful man: when I was asking him\\nabout a friend of mine, an old guest-friend,\\nwhether he is alive or dead in Hades,\\nthis fellow would not say, or even listen.\\nA while ago, in my own native land,\\nI had a guest to stay with me, who was\\nmy dearest friend of all my visitors.\\nHe said he was from Ithaca, and that \\nLaertes was his father. I had brought him\\ninto my house, and welcomed him with warmth;\\nI can aﬀord to be quite generous.\\nI gave him seven heaps of golden treasure,\\na bowl made all of silver and inlaid\\nwith flowers, twelve unfolded cloaks, and twelve\\nthick blankets, twelve fine mantles, and twelve tunics.\\nAlso I gave him four well-trained slave women,\\nbeautiful ones, whom he picked out himself.”\\nHis father answered through his tears, “Yes, stranger, \\nyou have reached Ithaca. But cruel men\\nhave taken over here. You will receive\\nnothing for all those gifts. If you had found him\\nstill living in this land, he would have matched\\nyour gifts and welcomed you with open arms\\nbefore he sent you home. Initial kindness\\ndeserves due recompense. But tell me now,\\nhow long is it since that unlucky man\\nvisited you? Your guest was my own son!\\nPerhaps fish ate him out at sea, so far \\nfrom home and family; or birds and beasts\\nate him on land. His mother did not lay\\nhis body out and weep for him; nor I,\\nhis father; nor Penelope his wife,\\na wise and wealthy woman. She has not\\nclosed her own husband’s eyes or given him\\na funeral. The dead deserve this honor.\\nBut tell me now, who are you? From what city?\\nWho are your parents? Do you have a ship\\ndocked somewhere, which conveyed you here with\\nfriends \\nand crew? Or did you sail as passenger\\non someone else’s ship, which now is gone?”\\nLying Odysseus replied, “I will\\ntell you the truth completely. I am from\\nAlybas, and I have a palace there.\\nMy name is Eperitus; I am son\\nof King Apheidas, son of Polypemon.\\nAn evil spirit struck me and I came\\nfrom Sicily against my will. My ship\\nis docked away from town. It is five years \\nsince poor, unfortunate Odysseus\\ncame to my home. As he was setting out\\nwe saw good omens—birds towards the right—\\nso we were hopeful we would meet again\\nas friends, and share more gifts.”\\nAt this, a cloud\\nof black grief wrapped itself around Laertes.\\nHe poured two handfuls of the ashy dust\\nover his gray old head, and started sobbing.\\nOdysseus felt heart-wrenched to see his own\\nbeloved father in this state; sharp pain \\npierced through his nostrils. He rushed up to him\\nand threw his arms around him, kissing him,\\nand saying,\\n“Father! It is me! I have\\nbeen gone for twenty years, and now am home,\\nin my own father’s country. Stop your tears.\\nI will explain, though we do not have long.\\nI killed the suitors in my house; I took\\nrevenge for all the pain they caused.”\\nLaertes\\nanswered, “If you are really my own son\\nOdysseus come home, show me a sign; \\nlet me be sure of it.”\\nOdysseus\\nwas quick to answer. “First, look here: the scar\\nmade by the boar’s white tusk when I had gone\\nto Mount Parnassus. You and Mother sent me,\\nto see my grandfather, Autolycus,\\nand get the gifts that he had promised me.\\nNext I will tell you all the trees that grow\\nin this fine orchard, which you gave to me.\\nWhen I was little, I would follow you\\naround the garden, asking all their names. \\nWe walked beneath these trees; you named them all\\nand promised them to me. Ten apple trees,\\nand thirteen pear trees, forty figs, and fifty\\ngrapevines which ripen one by one—their clusters\\nchange as the weather presses from the sky,\\nsent down by Zeus.”\\nAt that, Laertes’ heart\\nand legs gave way; he recognized the signs\\nOdysseus had given as clear proof.\\nHe threw both arms around his ruthless son,\\nwho caught him as he fainted. When his breath \\nand mind returned, he said,\\n“O Father Zeus,\\nyou gods are truly rulers of Olympus,\\nif it is true the suitors have been punished\\nfor all the monstrous things they did. But I\\nam terrified the Ithacans may soon\\nattack us here, and spread the news around\\nto all the towns of Cephallenia.”\\nScheming Odysseus said, “Do not fear.\\nCome to the farmhouse, where I sent my boy\\nto go with the two herdsmen, to prepare \\ndinner as fast as possible.”\\nWith this,\\nthe son and father walked towards the house.\\nThey found them serving generous plates of meat\\nand mixing wine. The slave from Sicily\\nwashed brave Laertes, and she rubbed his skin\\nwith olive oil, and wrapped a handsome cloak\\naround him. Then Athena, standing near,\\nmade him grow taller and more muscular.\\nWhen he emerged, Odysseus was shocked\\nto see him looking like a god. His words \\nflew fast.\\n“Oh, Father! You look diﬀerent!\\nA god has made you taller and more handsome.”\\nThoughtful Laertes said, “O Father Zeus,\\nAthena, and Apollo! If I were\\nas strong as when I took the sturdy fortress\\nof Nericus, out on the mainland shore,\\nwhen I was king of Cephallenia,\\nI would have stood beside you yesterday,\\nwith weapons on my back, and fought with you\\nagainst the suitors who were in our house! \\nI would have brought so many of them down,\\nyou would have been delighted!”\\nSo they spoke.\\nThe work of cooking dinner was complete,\\nand they sat down on chairs and stools, and reached\\nto take the food. The old slave Dolius\\napproached them with his sons, who had been working.\\nTheir mother, the Sicilian old woman,\\nhad gone to call them. She took care of them,\\nand also the old man, made weak by age.\\nThey saw Odysseus and stared, then stopped, \\nastonished. But he spoke to reassure them.\\n“Old man, sit down and eat. The rest of you,\\nput your surprise entirely out of mind.\\nWe have been waiting ages; we are eager\\nto have our dinner here.”\\nBut Dolius\\nran straight to him with arms outstretched, and took\\nOdysseus’ wrist and kissed his hand,\\nand let his words fly out.\\n“My friend! You have\\ncome home! We are so very glad to see you!\\nWe never thought this day would come! The gods \\nhave brought you here! A heartfelt welcome to you!\\nI pray the gods will bless you!—Does your wife\\nknow you have come back home? Or should I send\\na message?”\\nBut Odysseus said coolly,\\n“Old man, she knows already. Do not bother.”\\nSo Dolius sat back down on his chair.\\nHis sons were also clustering around\\ntheir famous owner, Lord Odysseus,\\nto welcome him and hold him in their arms.\\nThen they sat down in turn beside their father. \\nThey had their meal together in the farmhouse.\\nMeanwhile, swift Rumor spread the news all through\\nthe city, of the suitors’ dreadful murder.\\nWhen people heard, they rushed from all directions\\ntowards the palace of Odysseus,\\nwith shouts and lamentations. Then they brought\\nthe bodies from the house and buried them.\\nThe ones from distant towns were sent back home\\nby ship. The mourners gathered in the square,\\nheartbroken. When the people were assembled, \\nEupeithes first stood up and spoke to them.\\nThis man was inconsolable with grief\\nfor his dead son Antinous, the boy\\nOdysseus killed first. His father wept,\\ntears falling as he spoke.\\n“This scheming man,\\nmy friends, has done us all most monstrous wrongs.\\nFirst, he took many good men oﬀ to sail\\nwith him, and lost the ships, and killed the men!\\nNow he has come and murdered all the best\\nof Cephallenia. Come on, before \\nhe sneaks away to Pylos or to Elis,\\nwe have to act! We will be shamed forever\\nunless we take revenge on him for killing\\nour sons and brothers. I would have no wish\\nto live; I would prefer to die and join\\nthe boys already dead. We have to stop them\\nescaping overseas! Come on, right now!”\\nHe spoke in tears, and pity seized them all.\\nBut Medon and the bard had woken up;\\nthey came outside and stood among the crowd. \\nThey all were terrified, and Medon said,\\n“Now listen, Ithacans. Odysseus\\ncould not have done such things without the help\\nof gods. I saw a god myself, disguised\\nas Mentor, sometimes standing at his side,\\ngiving him will to fight, and sometimes rushing\\nall through the hall to make the suitors scatter.\\nThey fell like flies.”\\nPale terror seized them all.\\nThen Halitherses, an old warrior,\\nthe only one to know both past and future, \\nstood up; he wished them well. He said to them,\\n“Now hear me, Ithacans. My friends, it was\\nbecause of your own cowardice this happened.\\nYou did not listen to me, or to Mentor,\\nwhen we were telling you to stop your sons\\nfrom acting stupidly. They did great wrong,\\nthrough their impulsiveness; they skimmed the wealth\\nof an important man, and disrespected\\nhis wife, believing he would never come.\\nBut listen now. We must not go and fight, \\nor we will bring more ruin on our heads.”\\nAt that, some stayed there, huddling together,\\nbut more than half jumped up with shouts. They thought\\nEupeithes had the right idea. They rushed\\nto arms, and strapped their gleaming armor on,\\nand gathered in a mass before the town.\\nEupeithes was their leader—to his cost.\\nHe thought he would avenge his murdered son.\\nIn fact, he would not come back home; it was\\nhis fate to die out there.\\nAnd then Athena \\nspoke to the son of Cronus.\\n“Father Zeus,\\nhighest of powers! Tell what hidden thoughts\\nlie in you. Will you now make yet more war\\nand bitter strife, or join the sides in friendship?”\\nThe Gatherer of Clouds replied, “My child,\\nwhy ask me this? The plan was your idea,\\nto have Odysseus come take revenge.\\nDo as you wish. But here is my advice.\\nHe has already punished all the suitors,\\nso let them swear an oath that he will be \\nthe king forever, and let us make sure\\nthe murder of their brothers and their sons\\nwill be forgotten. Let them all be friends,\\njust as before, and let them live in peace\\nand in prosperity.”\\nAthena was\\nalready eager; at these words she swooped\\ndown from Olympus.\\nMeanwhile, they had finished\\ndinner, and battle-scarred Odysseus\\nsaid, “Somebody must go and see if they\\nare coming near.” A son of Dolius \\nobeyed and went. As he stepped out, he stood\\nacross the threshold, and he saw them all\\nnear to the house. At once his words took wings.\\nHe told Odysseus,\\n“Those men are near!\\nWe have to arm, and fast!”\\nThey quickly armed.\\nOdysseus, his son and their two slaves\\nmade four, and Dolius had his six sons.\\nLaertes and old Dolius were also\\nneeded as fighters, though they had gray hair.\\nWhen all of them were dressed in gleaming bronze, \\nthey opened up the gates and went outside;\\nOdysseus was leading them. Athena\\ncame near, disguised as Mentor. When he saw her,\\nweathered Odysseus was glad and turned\\ntowards Telemachus and said,\\n“Now, son,\\nsoon you will have experience of fighting\\nin battle, the true test of worth. You must\\nnot shame your father’s family; for years\\nwe have been known across the world for courage\\nand manliness.”\\nTelemachus inhaled, \\nthen said, “Just watch me, Father, if you want\\nto see my spirit. I will bring no shame\\nonto your family. You should not speak\\nof shame.”\\nLaertes, thrilled, cried out, “Ah, gods!\\nA happy day for me! My son and grandson\\nare arguing about how tough they are!”\\nWith glinting eyes, Athena stood beside him\\nand said, “You are my favorite, Laertes.\\nPray to the bright-eyed goddess and her father,\\nthen lift and hurl your spear.”\\nAs she said this, \\nAthena breathed great energy inside him.\\nLaertes quickly raised and hurled the spear,\\nand struck Eupeithes through his bronze-cheeked\\nhelmet,\\nwhich did not stop the weapon; it pierced through.\\nThen with a thud he fell; his armor clanged\\naround him on the ground. Odysseus\\ncharged the front line, his radiant son beside him;\\nthey hacked with swords and curving spears. They would\\nhave killed them all and made sure none of them\\ncould go back home—but then Athena spoke. \\nHer voice held back the fighters.\\n“Ithacans!\\nStop this destructive war; shed no more blood,\\nand go your separate ways, at once!”\\nHer voice\\nstruck them with pale green fear and made them drop\\ntheir weapons. They were desperate to save\\ntheir lives, and they turned back towards the city.\\nUnwavering Odysseus let out\\na dreadful roar, then crouched and swooped upon them,\\njust like an eagle flying from above.\\nBut Zeus sent down a thunderbolt, which fell \\nin front of his own daughter, great Athena.\\nShe looked at him with steely eyes and said,\\n“Odysseus, you are adaptable;\\nyou always find solutions. Stop this war,\\nor Zeus will be enraged at you.”\\nHe was\\nglad to obey her. Then Athena made\\nthe warring sides swear solemn oaths of peace\\nfor future times—still in her guise as Mentor.\\n'"
