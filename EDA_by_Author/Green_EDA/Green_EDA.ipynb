         "\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Alkinoos, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\nit is indeed a good thing to listen to such a minstrel\nas this man is, who resembles the gods in his singing!\nThere is, I’d say, no greater fulfillment of pleasure\nthan when all the people share a common enjoyment,\nand those feasting in the halls are listening to a minstrel\nas they sit there in order, and all the tables are loaded\nwith bread and meat, and the cupbearer draws off wine\nfrom the bowl, and pours it into the cups. Indeed,\nto me this seems the very best kind of occasion.\nBut your spirit has moved you to ask about my unhappy\ntroubles, that I may weep and sigh still further.\nWhat then shall I tell you first, what later? The heavenly\ngods have laid on me sorrows past counting. First,\nnow, I’ll tell you my name, that you all may know it,\nand afterwards, if I escape the pitiless day, I may\nin turn be your host, far off though I make my home.\nI am Odysseus, Laertes’ son, well known to all mankind\nfor my crafty devices: my fame goes up to heaven.\nMy home is in sunny Ithake: there’s a mountain on it,\na landmark, Neriton, leaf-clad; and around it are many\nislands, set close each one to its next neighbor—\nDoulichion, Same, and forested Zakynthos.\nIthake itself lies low in the sea, furthest out toward\nnight, but the rest are apart, nearer dawn and sunrise.\nIt’s rough land, but fine for raising young men. Myself,\nI can’t think of a sweeter sight than one’s own country.\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, kept me with her, it’s true,\nin her hollow caves, wanting me for her husband;\nand Kirke likewise detained me in her halls,\nthat wily Aiaian lady, wanting me for her husband;\nbut neither could ever persuade the heart in my breast—\nso sure as nothing’s sweeter than a man’s own country\nand forebears, though he may live far away in a rich home\nin some foreign land, and quite remote from his parents.\n“But come, let me tell you now of the grief-laden homecoming\nthat Zeus afflicted me with on my way back home from Troy.\nFrom Ilion the wind drove me, brought me to the Kikones,\nto Ismaros. There I sacked the city, slaughtered the men.\nFrom the city we took both the wives and a heap of goods\nand divided them. I made sure none got less than a fair share.\nThen I was all for us light-footing it out of there,\nand so urged; but the rest, the great fools, refused to listen.\nThen much wine was drunk, and many a sheep they slew\nalong the shore, many crumple-horned shambling steers.\nThe Kikones meanwhile had gone and appealed to other Kikones,\ntheir neighbors—more numerous, and more courageous too,\nwho dwelt on the mainland, and knew all about fighting\nfrom chariots as well as, where necessary, on foot.\nThey came now, as thick as leaves and flowers in season,\nat dawn: then indeed an ill fate from Zeus beset us,\nout of luck as we were, brought us a mass of troubles.\nBy the swift ships they stood and fought: each side\nattacked the other with their bronze-tipped spears.\nWhile it was morning still, while the sacred day increased,\nwe stood firm and held them off, despite their numbers;\nbut once the sun had reached the hour for unyoking oxen,\nthen the Kikones broke the Achaians and overwhelmed them,\nand six of our well-greaved comrades from each ship\ndied, but the rest of us dodged death and destiny. So\nwe sailed on from there, lamenting at heart, but glad\nat having got clear of death, though we’d lost our comrades.\nNor did I let our curved ships proceed any further\nuntil we’d all called out three times to each of our luckless\ncomrades who’d died on the plain, cut down by the Kikones.\nYet against our ships cloud-gathering Zeus still roused\nthe north wind, with an awesome tempest, and hid\nboth land and deep sea behind clouds: night sprang from heaven.\nOur ships were driven on sidelong, fragments—three, four—\nwere ripped from the sails by the violence of the wind.\nSo, scared of destruction, we lowered them to the deck,\nand rowed our way hastily landward. There for two\nnights and two days continuously we lay to,\neating our hearts out with sorrow and sheer exhaustion;\nbut when fair-haired Dawn brought on the third day, then\nwe stepped the masts, hoisted the white sails, and took\nour seats: the wind and the helmsmen steered our vessels.\nAnd then unscathed I would have come back to my own country;\nbut as I was rounding Cape Malea the waves and the current\nand the north wind drove me off course, sent me past Kythera.\nFor the next nine days I was borne on by deadly winds\nover the fish-rich sea; on the tenth I set foot\non the land of the Lotus-Eaters, who feed off a flowery food.\nHere we went ashore and replenished our store of water,\nand my comrades now had a meal, there by the swift ships.\nBut when we’d gotten our fill of food and drink,\nthen I sent out some comrades to go ahead and discover\nwhat kind of people, among earth’s bread-eaters, dwelt here—\ntwo men I chose, and a third to go with them as herald.\nThey went straight off, and soon found the Lotus-Eaters;\nand these Lotus-Eaters, far from wanting to kill\nour comrades, offered them lotus to eat. Now none\nwho consumed the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus any longer\nhad the urge to bring news back or continue the voyage,\nbut were set upon staying right there, with the Lotus-Eaters,\nmunching lotus, their homecoming all forgotten.\nThese men I myself dragged weeping back to the ships,\nand tied them up below deck in the hollow vessels,\nand ordered all the rest of my trusty companions\nto board the swift ships without delay, lest any\nby eating the lotus should forget their homecoming.\nSo they quickly embarked, and, seating themselves at the rowlocks,\nranged in good order, struck the grey brine with their oars.\n“From there we sailed on further, grieving at heart, until\nwe reached the Kyklopes’ country—an arrogant, lawless\npeople who, relying upon the immortal gods,\nwith their own hands plant nothing, nor do they plow;\nbut everything flourishes for them, unplowed, unsown:\nwheat and barley, and vines that bear rich clusters\nof grapes; and the rain of Zeus makes them grow. They have\nneither assemblies for counsel nor established customs,\nbut make their homes near the summits of high mountains\nin hollow caves, and each man lays down the law\nto his children and wives: they care nothing for one another.\n“A fertile island’s spread out there, beyond the harbor,\nneither near the Kyklopes’ land, nor yet remote from it,\nwell wooded: on it countless wild goats flourish,\nfor no human comings and goings get in their way,\nnor do hunters disturb them, men who have it rough\ntracking game in the woodland over the mountain tops;\nnor is it grazed on by flocks or put under the plow,\nbut unsown and unplowed all its days it stays bereft\nof humankind, supports nothing but bleating goats.\nFor the Kyklopes have no vermilion-cheeked vessels,\nnor in their land are there shipwrights, who might build them\nwell-benched ships that could answer all their needs,\ntake them to other men’s countries (as often enough\nmen traverse the sea in ships to call upon one another)—\nmen who could also develop the island for them,\nfor it’s far from poor and could grow every crop in season:\non it are meadows, beyond the banks of the salt-grey sea,\nsoft and well watered: vines would never lack moisture,\nthe earth’s good for plowing, they could reap deep-standing\nharvests in season, so rich is the subsoil. Here too\nis a good safe harbor, with no need of moorings, either\nanchor stones to throw out or stern warps to secure:\none can just beach one’s vessel and wait till the crew are minded\nto put to sea, and get a soft following wind.\nAt the head of the harbor there’s bright water flowing,\na spring from under a cave, with poplars growing round it.\nThere we sailed in, and some god gave us guidance\nthrough the murky night, for there was no light to see by:\na deep mist lay round the ships, nor did the moon\nshed any light from heaven, but was obscured by clouds.\nNone got a glimpse of that island, nor could we see\nthe long breakers rolling in on the shore, until\nwe beached all our well-benched vessels, and, that done,\nlowered the sails on each one of them, and ourselves\nthen disembarked on the seashore, and lay down\nto sleep, and awaited the coming of dawn and brightness.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nwe went exploring the island, in amazement at it,\nand the nymphs, the daughters of aegis-bearing Zeus,\nsent out the mountain goats, to give my comrades dinner.\nAt once we took from the ships curved bows and long-socketed\ngoat-spears, and forming ourselves into three groups\nwent hunting, and right off some god provided us\nwith a most satisfactory bag. Twelve ships came with me,\nand each got nine goats by lot; for me alone they chose ten.\n“So then for the rest of the day until the sun went down\nwe sat eating abundant meat and drinking the sweet wine,\nfor not yet was all the red wine in our ships consumed,\nbut some remained; each crew had drawn off a great deal\nin jars, when we sacked the Kikones’ sacred citadel.\nNow we were looking across at the nearby Kyklopes’ country—\nsaw smoke, heard their voices, the bleat of their sheep and goats.\nBut when the sun had set and darkness came on,\nthen we lay down and slept along the line of the shore.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nI called an assembly and declared before them all:\n‘The rest of you stay here now, my trusty comrades:\nI with my own ship and my own crew will go over\nand find out about these men—who they may be,\nwhether they’re violent creatures, savage, and lawless,\nor hospitable people, men with god-fearing minds.’\n“That said, I boarded my vessel, ordered my companions\nto embark themselves, and to cast off the stern warps.\nThey came aboard quickly, seated themselves at the rowlocks,\nand sitting in order struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\nBut when we got to the place, quite near at hand, there at\nthe land’s edge, close to the sea, we saw a cave,\nhigh, overgrown with laurels, where abundant flocks\nof sheep and goats spent the night. Around it a high\nwall had been built, with stones sunk deep in the ground,\nand long timbers of pine and lofty-crested oak.\nThere a monstrous man had his dwelling, who all alone\nherded his flocks far off, consorted with no others,\nbut lived by himself, mind bred in lawlessness:\na monstrous wonder, resembling not so much\nany bread-eating mortal, but rather the wooded peak\nof some lofty mountain, standing out apart from the rest.\n“Then I ordered the rest of my trusty comrades to stay there,\nwhere they were, by the ship, and to stand guard over it;\nbut I, having chosen the twelve best among my comrades,\nwent on, taking a goatskin full of the sweet dark wine\nthat Maro gave me—Maro, Euanthes’ son and priest\nof Apollo, the guardian of Ismaros—because we had\nprotected him, together with his wife and his child,\nout of reverence: his dwelling was in a wooded grove\nof Phoibos Apollo, and he gave me splendid gifts:\nof fine-wrought gold he bestowed on me seven talents,\nwith a mixing bowl all of silver, besides the wine,\nwith which he filled a dozen large jars in all,\nsweet and unmixed, a heavenly drink: not one\nof his house servants or handmaids had knowledge of it,\nonly himself, and his wife, and one woman, their housekeeper;\nand whenever they drank this honey-sweet red wine\nhe’d mix one cup of wine with twenty measures of water,\nand from the bowl would rise an aroma of marvelous\nsweetness—then indeed to abstain would be no pleasure!\nWith this wine I filled and took with me a sizable goatskin,\nand a leather bag packed with food, for my sharp mind sensed\nthat the man we were going to encounter, clad in huge strength,\nwas wild, with no knowledge of justice or civil rights.\n“So we quickly came to the cave, but did not find him\ninside: he was out, tending his fat flocks at pasture.\nThen we entered the cave, amazed by all we saw there:\nbaskets loaded with cheeses, pens full of lambs\nand kids. Each age-group was sorted out separately—\nthe older ones by themselves, the middlers likewise,\nthe newborn too. All the pans were brimming with whey,\nthe buckets and bowls, well wrought, that he used for milking.\nRight off, my comrades spoke up, implored me to take\nsome of the cheeses and leave, then quickly to drive\nkids and lambs from the pens back to our swift ship,\nand sail away over the deep salt sea. But I would not\nlisten—far better indeed had I done so!—for I wanted\nto meet this man, find out if he’d treat me as a guest.\nNo joy was he to my comrades when he did appear!\n“So we lit a fire, and made sacrifice, and ourselves\ntook some of the cheeses and ate them, sat there inside\nwaiting, till he returned with his flock, hefting a great\nload of dry firewood to serve him at suppertime,\nand dumped it down with a crash as he came inside.\nWe shrank back, terrified, into the back of the cave,\nwhile he drove his fat flocks into the roomy cavern—\nall, that is, that he milked; the males he left outside,\nhe-goats and rams, there in the deep yard. Then\nhe lifted and put in place a huge and massive\ndoor stone: not twenty-two four-wheeled wagons,\nstrong ones, would have sufficed to raise it off the threshold,\nsuch a towering mass of rock he set in the doorway!\nThen down he sat and milked the ewes and bleating she-goats,\nall in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\nNext, once he’d curdled half the white milk, he collected\nthe curds in wicker baskets and put them aside.\nThe remaining half he left in the pails, so it would be handy\nto take and drink, and be ready for him at supper.\nBut after he’d busied himself with these tasks, he rekindled\nthe fire, and caught sight of us, and questioned us, saying:\n‘So, strangers, who are you? From where was it you sailed here\nover the watery ways? On business? Or do you rove at random,\ncruising the sea like pirates, who, at risk of their own lives,\ngo around making trouble for men from other lands?’\n“So he spoke, and we succumbed to panic in our hearts,\nterrified by his deep voice and his monstrous person;\nyet even so I responded, and addressed him, saying:\n‘We are, if you please, Achaians, driven wandering from Troy\nby all the winds, across the great gulf of the sea,\nseeking our homes, but blown on a different route,\nthe wrong paths: Zeus, I guess, must have planned it thus.\nWe are, we claim, men serving Atreus’ son Agamemnon—\nwhose fame now is unsurpassed under heaven, so great\na city he sacked, so many people he slew! But we\nwho come to you now are suppliants, clasp your knees,\nhoping you’ll treat us as guests, or in some other way\ngive us some kind of present, as is proper with strangers.\nKind sir, revere the gods! We are here as your suppliants,\nand Zeus is the protector of suppliants and strangers,\nthe strangers’ god, who looks after respectful guests.’\n“So I spoke. And he with pitiless heart responded:\n‘You’re a fool, stranger, or you must come from far away,\ntelling me either to fear or to steer clear of the gods!\nThe Kyklopes pay no attention to Zeus of the aegis,\nnor to the blessed gods—we’re far mightier than they!\nNor would I, to avoid the wrath of Zeus, spare either\nyou or your comrades, unless the spirit so moved me!\nBut where, coming here, did you leave your well-built ship?\nFar off was it, or nearby? Tell me: I’d like to know.’\n“So he spoke, testing me; but I knew too much to be tricked,\nand when I replied it was with guile of my own:\n‘My ship was broken up by Poseidon the Earth-Shaker,\nwho cast it upon the rocks at the frontier of your country:\nclose to the headland he drove it: the wind brought it ashore.\nBut I, and these men here, eluded sheer destruction.’\n“So I spoke. He, with ruthless heart, made me no answer,\nbut sprang up, laid hands on my comrades, grappled two,\nand down on the ground, as though they were mere puppies,\ndashed them: their brains spilled earthwards, wetted the floor.\nThen limb from limb he tore them to prepare his supper,\nand devoured them like a mountain-bred lion, leaving nothing—\ninnards and flesh, bones with the marrow in them,\nwhile we, lamenting, reached out our hands to Zeus\nat the sight of such bestial deeds. Helplessness overmastered\nour hearts. When the Kyklops had glutted his vast belly\nby gobbling human flesh, washed down with unmixed milk,\nhe settled to sleep in the cave, stretched out among his sheep.\nSo I planned an attack on him in my great-hearted spirit:\nI’d steal up close, draw the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\nand drive it into his breast, where the midriff cups the liver,\nfinding the spot with my hand. But a second thought stopped me—\nwe too would have perished there, faced sheer destruction,\nfor we could never have thrust back from the lofty\nentrance with our bare hands the huge stone he’d set there,\nand so, lamenting, we lay there, awaiting the bright Dawn.\n“As soon as Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nhe rekindled the fire, and began milking his fine flocks,\nall in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\nThen after he’d briskly accomplished his various tasks\nhe again grabbed two men together, and readied his meal.\nWhen he’d eaten, he drove his fat flocks out of the cave,\neasily shifting the enormous door-stone, and afterwards\nsetting it back in place, like the lid on a quiver.\nThen, whistling loudly, the Kyklops steered his fat flocks\nuphill, and I was left there, planning mischief deep in my heart—\nto get back at him, have Athene let me boast of what I’d done!\n“Now this was the plan that seemed, to my mind, the likeliest:\nThe Kyklops had left a great club beside a sheep pen,\nof green olive wood, that he’d cut to carry with him\nwhen it had dried out. Eyeing this, we compared it\nin size to the mast of a black ship of twenty oars,\na broad-beamed merchantman, one that crosses the great\nsea gulf—so huge did its length and breadth look to us.\nI went and chopped off a piece about a fathom long:\nhanded this to my comrades, told them to scrape it down,\nand they made it smooth, while I stood there and sharpened\nits point, then took and hardened it in the blazing fire,\nand stowed it out of sight, hiding it under the dung\nthat was strewn throughout the cave in heaped-up piles.\nI ordered the others to cast lots to decide\nwhich ones would dare, with me, to hoist up this stake\nand ram it into his eye, when sweet sleep overcame him.\nThe lot picked out the same ones whom I’d have chosen,\nfour of them; with these, as the fifth, I picked myself.\n“In the evening back he came, herding his fine-fleeced flocks,\nand straightway drove his fat flocks into the wide cave—\nall of them, left none outside in the deep enclosure:\nsome idea of his own, perhaps—or a god’s command?\nHe lifted and put in place the huge and massive door-stone,\nthen sat down and milked the ewes and bleating she–goats,\nall in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\nThen after he’d briskly accomplished his various tasks\nhe again grabbed two men together, and readied his meal.\nIt was now that I spoke to the Kyklops, going and standing\nbeside him, in my hands an ivy-wood bowl of dark wine:\n‘Here, Kyklops, drink this wine, now you’ve fed on human flesh,\nand learn what fine wine it is that’s stowed aboard our ship:\nI was bringing it as a libation, hoping you’d feel pity\nfor me, and send me on homeward; but your mad fury\nis not to be borne! Cruel wretch, how in future will any man\nin the world come near you? What you’ve done is an outrage.’\n“So I spoke. He took the wine, drained it, was vastly pleased\nas he swilled the sweet stuff, demanded a second bowlful:\n‘Quick, give me some more—and also tell me your name,\nnow, at once! I want to give you a guest-gift you’ll enjoy!\nFor the Kyklopes too the grain-giving earth bears vines\nwith rich clusters of grapes, and Zeus’ rain makes them grow;\nbut this—this is a match for ambrosia and nectar!’\n“So he spoke; and I once more brought him the bright wine.\nThree bowlfuls I fetched and gave him, three times in his folly\nhe drained them. Then, when the wine had fuddled his wits,\nI addressed him with honey-sweet words, saying: ‘Kyklops,\ndo you ask me my famous name? Very well, I will tell you—\nand then you give me that guest-gift, just as you promised!\nNobody is my name, Nobody’s what I’m called by\nmy mother and father and all my comrades.’\n“So I spoke,\nand at once he with pitiless heart responded: ‘Nobody\nI shall eat last of all, when I’ve had all his companions,\nand the others first: so, that will be your guest-gift.’\n“So saying, he swayed and fell on his back, lay sprawling\nwith his thick neck twisted sideways: overmastering sleep\npossessed him, from his gullet there gushed out wine\nand gobbets of human flesh, as he drunkenly vomited.\nIt was now that I thrust the stake deep into the embers\nto let it get hot, and encouraged all my companions\nwith heartening words, lest any back off from fear.\nThen, just as the olive-wood stake, though green, was about\nto catch fire, and was glowing, intensely incandescent,\nI leaned close, pulled it clear of the flames. My companions\ncrowded around me. Some god breathed great courage into us.\nThe others grasped the olive-wood stake, sharp-pointed,\nand rammed it into his eye, while I leaned over it,\nand twisted it round. As when a man with a drill\nbores a ship timber, and those below keep it turning\nwith a strap held at either end, and the drill runs nonstop—\njust so we grasped and in his eye kept turning\nthat fire-sharpened stake: round the red-hot orb blood ran.\nEyelids and eyebrows alike were singed by the fiery breath\nfrom the burning eyeball: its roots now crackled in the heat.\nAs when a blacksmith plunges a great axe or an adze\nin cold water to temper it, and it hisses loudly—\nfor this is how iron achieves its greatest strength—just so\ndid his eye now hiss around the olive-wood point. He gave\na terrible scream, that made the rock resound,\nand we shrank back in terror. He tore the stake, all slobbered\nwith fresh-shed blood, from his eye, and with both arms\nhurled it from him, maddened with pain, and screamed aloud\nto the other Kyklopes, those who were his neighbors,\ndwelling in caves near the windswept mountaintops,\nand they heard him cry out, and gathered from all around,\nand stood by the cave and asked him what was the matter:\n‘What great hurt, Polyphemos, is it makes you scream like that\nthrough the ambrosial night, and rouse us all from sleep?\nSurely no mortal is rustling your flocks against your will?\nSurely you’re not being murdered by guile or by force?’\n“From within\nthe cave mighty Polyphemos answered them thus: ‘My friends,\nNobody’s killing me by guile, not by force.’ To this,\naddressing him with winged words, they now responded:\n ‘If no one is harming you, then, and you’re alone, there’s no\nway you can dodge a sickness sent by great Zeus: you must\njust offer up prayers to our father, Lord Poseidon.’\n“So they spoke,\nand departed. I laughed in my heart at the way that name,\nand my faultless planning, had so deceived them. Meanwhile\nthe Kyklops, groaning and suffering agonies of pain,\ngroped with his hands, took the stone from the cave’s entrance,\nand sat there in the opening with both arms wide outstretched,\nhoping to catch anybody who tried to slip out with the sheep—\ndid he really suppose I was going to be that stupid?\nBy now I’d figured out just what I would have to do\nto find an escape from death both for my companions\nand for myself: I’d thought of every trick and device\nthat might save our lives: the threat was great and immediate.\nNow this, to my mind, looked the best of such plans:\nThere were the rams, well-nourished and thickly fleeced,\nfine strapping specimens, the wool on them violet-dark.\nThese I silently tied together with pliable withies—\non which the Kyklops, bred in lawlessness, would sleep—\ntaking three at a time: the middle one carried a man,\nwhile the ones on each flank gave my comrades protection:\nthus each three sheep bore one person. As for myself,\nthere was one special ram, the best in the whole flock:\nhim I grasped by the back, curled up under his shaggy belly,\nand lay with my hands twisted into his marvelous fleece,\nholding on tight, with great patience, never relaxing.\nAnd so, lamenting, we lay there, awaiting the bright dawn.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthen the males of the flocks sallied out of the cave to pasture,\nwhile the ewes went bleating about their pens, unmilked,\nwith bursting udders. Their master, in agonizing pain,\nkept feeling along the backs of all his sheep\nas they stood before him. The booby never perceived\nthat under his rich-fleeced sheep there were men tied on!\nLast of the flock the ram approached the entrance, heavy\nwith his thick wool—and with me and my quick thinking!\nGroping his back, the strong Polyphemos addressed him, saying:\n‘Dear ram, why do you come thus through the cave, the very\nlast of the flock? You used not to lag behind the others,\nbut were always first out, to graze on the lushest pasture,\nstriding ahead, the first to reach the flowing river,\nthe first that liked to head back into the sheepfold when\nevening came on. But now you’re the last of all. Are you mourning,\nmaybe, your master’s lost eye, which a wicked man put out,\nhe and his wretched fellows, when he’d doused my wits with wine—\nNobody—who, I tell you, is not clear of destruction yet !\nIf you only could think as I do and had the power of speech\nto tell me where that creature is hiding away from my might,\nthen would his brains, dashed out, lie scattered over the ground\nthroughout the cave, and my spirit would be lightened\nof all the ills which that nothing-worth Nobody’s brought me.’\nSo saying, he let the ram go on out through the entrance.\n“When we’d moved on a little way from the cave and the enclosure,\nfirst I loosed myself from the ram, then untied my comrades.\nQuickly then we drove off the fat, smart-stepping sheep,\nglancing back all the time, until we reached our ship.\nA welcome sight to our dear comrades were those of us\nwho’d escaped death: for the others they started wailing.\nBut this I stopped, with a silent upward jerk of the head\nthat said ‘No’ to their weeping. I told them to throw on board,\nfast, all the fine-fleeced sheep, and to put to sea at once.\nThey came aboard quickly, each man to his rowlock, and seated\nin proper order they struck the grey brine with their oars,\nand when we had backed offshore as far as a man’s shout\nwould carry, I called out to the Kyklops with mocking words:\n‘Kyklops, it was, then, no weakling whose comrades you planned,\nby might and brute force, to eat in your hollow cave! In full\nwere your evil deeds to rebound on your own head, vile wretch,\nwho did not shrink from eating the guests in your house, for which\nZeus and the other gods have exacted requital from you.’\n“So I spoke, and my words made him yet more angry at heart,\nso that he wrenched off, and hurled at us, the peak of a lofty\nmountain, that fell just in front of our dark-prowed vessel,\nnarrowly missing the end of the steering oar: the sea\nsurged up under the falling rock’s impact, created\na wave that carried our vessel straight back shoreward,\na heaving swell from the deep, aimed directly at the land.\nBut I seized a very long pole in my hands and thrust us\nclear once more, and urgently signed to my comrades\nto row for dear life, and get us away from danger,\ngesturing with my head. They bent to their oars, and rowed.\nBut when, working hard at the sea, we’d doubled the distance,\nthen I shouted again to the Kyklops, though all around\nmy comrades with calming arguments tried stop me:\n‘Stubborn wretch, why so set on infuriating this savage?\nJust now he flung some missile seaward, drove our vessel\nback to land—indeed, we thought we were done for!\nIf he’d heard any one of us making a sound, or shouting,\nhe’d have broken our heads as well as the ship’s timbers\nwith a cast of some sharp glinting boulder, so mighty his arm!’\n“Thus they spoke, but could not shift my great-hearted spirit,\nand I answered him back, irate and resentful at heart:\n‘Kyklops, if any mortal, of all mankind, should ask you\nabout your eye’s unseemly blindness, tell them it was\nOdysseus, sacker of cities, who destroyed your eyesight:\nLaertes’ son, who calls Ithake his home.’\n“So I spoke,\nand he groaned aloud, and then responded to me, saying:\n‘Alas, that ancient prophecy has indeed come true for me!\nThere once was a prophet here, a great gentleman too—\nTelemos, Eurymos’ son, a man unmatched in seercraft,\nwho grew old as a diviner among the Kyklopes: he\ntold me that all these things would happen in time to come,\nthat by Odysseus’ hands I’d be deprived of my sight.\nBut I always thought it would be some tall and handsome\nhero who’d show up here, endowed with mighty strength:\nBut in fact it’s this puny, no-account weakling who’s\ndeprived me of eyesight after fuddling my wits with wine!\nCome back here, Odysseus, and let me offer you guest-gifts,\nand urge the famed Earth-Shaker to grant you conveyance home,\nfor I am his son, and he avows that he’s my father.\nHe himself, if he so chooses, will heal me—he, and none other,\nwhether one of the blessed gods or some mortal human.’\n“So he spoke, and I answered him, saying: ‘How I wish\nI had the power to strip you of breath and life, and send you\ndown to the realm of Hades, as surely as no one\nwill heal your eye, not even the Earth-Shaker himself.’\n“So I spoke, and he then prayed to the lord Poseidon,\nreaching out both his hands to the starry heavens: ‘Hear me,\nPoseidon, dark-haired Earth-Shaker, if I am truly\nyour son, if you avow yourself my father! Grant\nthat Laertes’ son, whose home is on Ithake,\nOdysseus, sacker of cities, shall not reach home—\nBut if it’s fated that he’s to see his loved ones again,\nto come back to his well-built house and his native land,\nmay he get there late, in bad shape, all his comrades lost,\nin a ship not his own, and be met with trouble in his home!’\n“So he spoke in prayer, and was heard by the dark-haired god.\nThen once more he hefted an even greater rock\nand swung and hurled it, putting huge force into the throw,\nand it landed only a little behind our dark-prowed vessel,\nnarrowly missing the end of the steering oar: the sea\nsurged up under the falling rock’s impact, created\na wave that carried our vessel straight on shoreward:\nand so we came back to the island where all our other\nwell-benched ships lay together, and around them sat\nour comrades in tears, forever awaiting our return.\nWhen we got there we ran up our vessel onto the beach,\nand ourselves disembarked upon the sandy strand.\nThe Kyklops’ sheep we fetched out from the hollow ship\nand allotted them so that no one got less than his fair share.\nBut the ram my well-greaved comrades allotted to me alone\nwhen the sheep were shared out, as a special prize: on the shore\nthis ram to Zeus, Kronos’ son, dark-clouded, omnipotent,\nI sacrificed, burned the thighs. But he ignored my offering:\nhe had in mind the destruction of all my well-benched ships,\nand every last one of my trusty comrades. So then\nthe whole long day until the going down of the sun\nwe sat feasting on meat in abundance and sweet wine;\nbut when the sun had set and darkness came on\nthen we lay down and slept along the line of the shore.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthen indeed I aroused my companions and ordered them\nto embark themselves, and to cast off the stern warps.\nThey came aboard quickly, seated themselves at the rowlocks,\nand sitting in order struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\n“So we sailed on from there, lamenting at heart, but relieved\nat having got clear of death, though we’d lost our comrades.”\n",

         "\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nTelemachos, dear son of godlike Odysseus, then\nfastened under his feet his fine sandals, picked out\na sturdy spear, that was comfortably fitted to his grasp,\nand, eager to leave for town, addressed the swineherd, saying:\n“Old fellow, I’m off to the city now, so that my mother\nmay actually see me: I have a feeling she won’t\ngive over her ghastly wailing and tearful lamentation\nuntil she sees me in person! Here’s what I want you to do:\nTake this unfortunate stranger into town, so he can\nbeg there for his dinner: whoever so wishes can give him\na crust and a cupful. No way can I burden myself with\nthe rest of mankind, with these troubles of my own!\nIf this angers the stranger, so much the worse for him\nwill it be: it’s my pleasure to speak the honest truth.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, neither do I myself want to be kept back here!\nFor a beggar it’s better to beg for his dinner in town\nthan out in the country: whoever so wishes can feed me.\nNo longer am I of an age to hang on here at the farmstead\nand do whatever some man in charge tells me I must!\nOff you go: this fellow here will take me as you ordered—\nwhen I’ve warmed myself at the fire, and the sun heats up!\nFor the clothes I have on are threadbare: I might be overcome\nby the dawn frost. You say, too, it’s a long way into town.”\nSo he spoke. Telemachos went out through the farmstead\nwith rapid strides, busy thinking up trouble for the suitors.\nWhen he reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, he stood\nthe spear he was carrying up against a lofty pillar,\nand himself went in, stepping over the stone threshold.\nThe first to see him by far was the old nurse Eurykleia\nas she spread fleeces over the richly decorated chairs.\nWeeping, she rushed to greet him, and the other handmaids\nof stout-hearted Odysseus now came crowding round them\nand kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome.\nNow prudent Penelope came down from her chamber,\nin appearance like Artemis, or like golden Aphrodite,\nand burst into tears as she hugged her own dear son,\nand kissed his head and both his bright shining eyes,\nand, between sobs, addressed him in winged words, saying:\n“You’re back, Telemachos, sweet light of my eyes! I thought\nI’d never see you again when you sailed off to Pylos—\nagainst my will, secretly, to seek news of your dear father!\nSo come now, tell me in detail what sightings you had of him.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Mother, don’t make me cry, don’t stir up my emotions\nwhen I’ve only just escaped sheer destruction! Instead\ngo upstairs to your chamber, take your handmaids with you,\nand wash yourself, put on a set of clean clothes,\nthen pray to all the gods, with full, perfect sacrifices,\nthat Zeus may one day enact deeds of retribution for us!\nI shall now go to the place of assembly, and invite home\nthe guest that came with me on my voyage back from Pylos.\nI sent him on ahead with my godlike comrades, and told\nPeiraios to take him back to his house, and give him\na kindly welcome, look after him till I myself arrived.”\nSo he spoke: her own answer remained unwinged.\nShe washed herself, and put on a set of clean clothes,\nand vowed to make full, perfect sacrifices to all\nthe gods if Zeus would enact deeds of retribution for them.\nTelemachos made his way out through the hall, his spear\ngrasped in one hand, two hunting dogs following at his heels,\nand marvelous was the grace that Athene shed upon him,\nso that all the people gazed at him in amazement as he came,\nand the haughty suitors now gathered all around him,\nspeaking fair words, but privately plotting trouble.\nHe, however, avoided the main crowd, and went over\nto where Mentor, Antiphos, and Halitherses were sitting,\nmen who from the start had been his father’s comrades,\nand sat with them, and they questioned him on every detail\nof his trip. Peiraios, famed spearman, then came over,\nbringing the stranger through the city to the assembly.\nTelemachos was not slow to join his guest, but approached him.\nFirst to speak was Peiraios, who now addressed him, saying:\n“Telemachos, send women over to my house now, at once,\nso I can deliver to you the gifts Menelaos gave you.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Peiraios, we don’t yet know how this business may turn out.\nIf the haughty suitors secretly slay me in my own halls,\nand share out all my family goods between them, then\nI want you, not one of them, to keep and enjoy these things;\nBut if I contrive death and destiny for that lot, then\nbring all the stuff to my house, and I’ll be glad to get it.”\nThat said, he took the stranger, so sorely tried, back home.\nWhen they reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, they took off\ntheir cloaks and laid them on the seats and the high chairs\nand went off to the polished bathtubs and had baths.\nAfter the handmaids had washed them, massaged them with oil,\nand dressed them in woolen mantles and tunics, they came\nout from the bathtubs and seated themselves on the chairs,\nand a servant brought hand-washing water in a beautiful\ngolden ewer and poured it over a silver basin\nso they could wash, and drew up a polished table for them.\nThe respected housekeeper brought in bread and served it\nalong with many side dishes, giving freely of what there was.\nHis mother sat facing Telemachos by the hall’s main pillar,\nsettled back in her chair, spinning fine yarn on her distaff.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nit was prudent Penelope who opened the conversation, saying:\n“Telemachos, I’m going back now to my upper chamber,\nto lie down on my bed, that’s become a bed of sorrow,\nalways damp with my tears, ever since Odysseus set out\nwith the sons of Atreus for Ilion. Yet you couldn’t be bothered,\nbefore the haughty suitors arrived in the house, to tell me\nany clear news you may have about your father’s return.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“Very well, mother, I’ll give you a true and complete account.\nWe traveled to Pylos, to Nestor, shepherd of the people,\nwho gave me a warm welcome in his lofty dwelling\nas an honored guest, the way a father might treat his son\nback home from a long spell abroad: with just such kindness\nhe looked after me, both he and his glorious sons.\nBut of steadfast-minded Odysseus, living or dead, he told me\nhe’d heard not one thing, from any man on earth.\nHe sent me to Atreus’ son, famed spearman Menelaos,\nin a carpentered chariot drawn by his own horses;\nand there I saw Argive Helen, on whose account, and by\nthe gods’ will, Argives and Trojans endured such hardship.\nThen straight off Menelaos, good at the war cry, asked me\nwhat it was I’d come in search of to lordly Lakedaimon.\nWhereupon I then told him the whole truth of the matter.\nAt this he responded to me with the following statement:\n‘I tell you, it was indeed in the bed of a brave warrior\nthat these fellows, cowards themselves, hoped they might lie!\nAs when in a thicket, the lair of a powerful lion,\na doe has laid to sleep her newborn suckling fawns\nand goes off, traversing foothills and grassy glens\nin search of pasture, and the lion returns to his den\nand on both her fawns unleashes a ghastly fate—just so\nwill Odysseus unleash a ghastly fate on these men!\nHow I wish—by Zeus the Father and Athene and Apollo!—\nthat he, as strong as he was that time in well-built Lesbos\nwhen he stood up and wrestled a bout with Philomeleides,\nand threw him down forcefully, and all the Achaians cheered,\nmight come—he, Odysseus—in such strength among these suitors!\nThen they’d all get a swift end and a bitter marriage!\nAs regards the business you’re enquiring about, I shan’t\nveer off onto other subjects, nor will I mislead you—\nof all that I heard from that forthright Old Man of the Sea\nnot one word will I keep back or conceal from you!\nHe said he’d seen Odysseus on an island, much frustrated,\nin the halls of the nymph Kalypso, who by constraint\ndetains him there, so he can’t get back to his own country:\nfor he has no ships with oars, nor any comrades\nto further his voyage over the broad back of the sea.’\n“So spoke Atreus’ son, the famed spearman Menelaos.\nWhen I’d done all this, I set out: the immortals gave me\na following wind, and a speedy voyage to my own country.”\nSo he spoke, and stirred the heart in her breast with his words.\nThen the godlike Theoklymenos also addressed them, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, truly\nyour son knows nothing for certain!! Listen rather to me,\nfor I shall foretell the truth to you, hold back nothing!\nZeus, first of gods, be my witness, and this guest-friendly board,\nand the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\nthat Odysseus is already here, in his own homeland, sitting\nquiet or stealing about, learning of these misdeeds,\nand planting the seeds of destruction for all the suitors:\nsuch the bird portent I noted as I sat on the well-benched\nship of Telemachos here, and duly expounded to him.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“If only these words of yours, stranger, might be fulfilled!\nThen would you quickly know friendship and gifts in plenty\nfrom me, so that any who met you would call you blessed.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nMeanwhile, out in front of Odysseus’ house, the suitors\nwere amusing themselves by throwing discus and javelin\non the leveled terrace as always, in their arrogance. But when\nthe time for dinner arrived, and the flocks were coming home\nfrom the fields on every side, led by their usual herdsmen,\nthen they were summoned by Medon—who pleased them best\nof the heralds, and was present at their dinners—saying:\n“Young men, now you’ve all pleasured your hearts with sport,\ncome on into the house, so we can get dinner ready,\nfor it’s no bad thing to have meals at the proper time.”\nSo he spoke, and they stood up and obeyed his summons.\nWhen they entered the pleasantly sited house they took off\ntheir cloaks and laid them down on the chairs and benches,\nand set about slaughtering big sheep and fattened goats,\nand plumped-up porkers, and a cow from the herd, as they\nmade ready their meal.\nNow Odysseus and the noble swineherd\nwere preparing to leave the countryside, go in to town;\nand the swineherd, leader of men, spoke first, declaring:\n“Stranger, since you’re so eager to go off into the city\ntoday, as my master commanded—though I myself\nwould rather have left you here to watch over the farmstead—\nnevertheless I respect him, and fear that he might\nreprimand me later, and a master’s rebukes can be harsh—\ncome on now, let’s be going: the day is nearly over,\nit will soon be evening, and a little too cold for you.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\nBut yes, let’s be going. Be my guide all the way. And give me—\nif there’s one around that’s been cut for your use—a strong\nstaff to support me. You said the road was uneven.”\nWith that he slung over his shoulder his worn-out leather bag,\ntattered and rent, which was held by a twisted cord,\nand Eumaios gave him a staff that was to his liking,\nand the two set out. Dogs and herdsmen were left behind\nto look after the farmstead, while the swineherd led his master\ninto town, in the guise of a miserable aged beggar\npropped on a staff, wearing mean and threadbare clothes.\nBut when, as they made their way along the stony path,\nthey’d come close to the city, and had reached a spring, from which,\npaved and fair-flowing, the townsfolk got their water—\ndeveloped by Ithakos, Neritos, and Polyktor,\nwith a grove of black waterside poplars that encircled it\non every side, and the chill water came flowing down\nfrom the rocks above, and up high there was built an altar\nto the nymphs, where all travelers made offerings—there\nMelanthios son of Dolios overtook them while driving\nthose she-goats that were the very best from all his herds\nfor the suitors’ dinner; two herdsmen accompanied him.\nWhen he saw them, he reviled them, addressing them personally\nin aggressive, unseemly terms, that enraged Odysseus’ heart:\n“Now here comes a total no-good leading a no-good! As usual,\nthe god’s bringing like and like together! Where, pray,\nyou wretched swineherd, are you taking this old bald pig,\nthis tiresome beggar, this walking blot on our feasts?\nHe’ll stand and rub his shoulders at many doorposts,\nbegging for scraps, but never for swords or cauldrons!\nIf you gave me this dolt to be a guard on my farmstead,\nto sweep out the pens and fetch green shoots for the kids,\nthen by drinking whey he could build up his thigh muscles!\nBut since all he’s learned is bad stuff, he won’t be willing\nto do real work—he’d rather slouch his way through\nthis district begging, to feed his bottomless belly!\nI’ll tell you one thing straight, that will certainly come to pass:\nif he hangs around the residence of godlike Odysseus, then\nthere’ll be plenty of footstools shied by men at his head\nthat his ribs will splinter as he’s pelted throughout the house.”\nSo he spoke. As he passed, in his folly he kicked Odysseus\non the hip, yet failed to knock him clear of the path.\nOdysseus stood there unshaken, pondering whether\nhe should attack with his staff, and beat the life out of him,\nor collar him by the waist, dash his head on the ground.\nBut he steeled himself, and endured. The swineherd stared\nin rebuke at this fellow, raised his arms, and prayed aloud:\n“You nymphs of the spring, Zeus’ daughters, if Odysseus\never burned thigh pieces for you, wrapped in rich fat,\nof lambs or kids, then grant me fulfillment of this prayer:\nmay that man, my master, return, and divinity guide him!\nThen would he scatter all those glorious airs that you\nflaunt in your arrogance now, always strutting around\nthis township, while useless herdsmen bring the flocks to ruin.”\nThe goatherd Melanthios responded to him, saying:\n“My oh my, how this dog rants, mind full of malice!\nOne day I’ll carry him off in a well-benched black ship,\nfar away from Ithake, where he might bring me a fortune.\nOh, I wish silver-bowed Apollo would strike down Telemachos\ntoday in his halls, or the suitors would kill him, as surely\nas for Odysseus, far off, the day of return’s been lost.”\nSo saying, he left them behind there, as they walked slowly on,\nwhile he moved fast, and soon reached his master’s house.\nHe went straight in, and sat down among the suitors,\nfacing Eurymachos, the friend whom he liked the best.\nThe carvers set before him a portion of roast meat, while\nthe respected housekeeper brought him bread, and placed it\nready to eat. Now Odysseus and the noble swineherd\nstopped when they got near; about them rang the notes\nof the hollow lyre, for Phemios was preparing to sing for them.\nThen Odysseus clutched the swineherd’s hand, and said:\n“Eumaios, surely this is Odysseus’ fine house? It’s easily\ndistinguishable from the rest, even when there are many.\nOne building’s linked to another, and the courtyard’s fitted\nwith wall and copestones, its doors are finely worked\nand double-paneled: no man could furnish it better. And I\nobserve that within there’s a feast for many in progress,\nfor the smell of roast meat rises from it, and within it echoes\nthe lyre, made by the gods an accompaniment to feasting.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“Easily did you know it, for in all else you don’t lack sense.\nBut now we have to think how we shall act next.\nYou could go first into this pleasantly sited house,\nand mix with the suitors, while I stay out here. Or else,\nif you like, you stay here, and I’ll go in before you.\nBut don’t linger outside too long, or someone might notice,\nand hit you or chase you off. Do please be careful.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\nYou go on ahead, and I’ll stay behind out here—\nI’m not unused to being hit, or having things thrown at me.\nMy spirit is steadfast, for I’ve suffered many setbacks\nfrom rough seas and in war: let this be added to them!\nBut a ravening belly there’s no way of concealing—\nan accursed plague, that brings many evils upon mankind.\nFor its sake, too, well-benched ships are armed and sent\nout on the unharvested sea, bearing ills to their enemies.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nNow a dog lying there raised its head and pricked up its ears—\nArgos, stout-hearted Odysseus’ dog, that he, years ago,\nhad bred up himself, but got no joy of, departing too soon\nfor sacred Ilion. Young hunters used to take Argos\nto go in pursuit of wild goats, or deer, or hares; but now\nhe lay neglected, his master long since absent,\nin the abundant dung of the mules and oxen left\noutside the gates, until the servants of Odysseus\ncarted it off to manure his widespread estate. There lay\nthe dog Argos now, his body crawling with dog ticks.\nBut the moment he sensed that it was Odysseus nearby\nhe wagged his tail and laid back both ears, and yet\nno longer had the strength to move any closer to\nhis master, who now looked away, and wiped off a tear\nthat he easily hid from Eumaios, then questioned him, saying:\n“Eumaios, it’s odd, this dog lying here in the dung—\nhe has a good body, but I still can’t really be certain\nif he once had the speed to match his fine appearance,\nor was nothing more than one of those table dogs\nthat their masters take care of only to put on a show.”\nTo him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“This is indeed the dog of a man who died far away.\nIf he were such today, in body and performance,\nas he was when Odysseus left him, and set out for Troy,\nyou’d at once be astonished on seeing his speed and strength!\nNo wild beast that he started in the thick woodland’s depths\never escaped him. He was also a keen-nosed tracker.\nBut now he’s in a poor way, and his master has perished\nfar from his homeland. The women are heedless, can’t be bothered\nto care for him. Servants no longer directed by their master\nwon’t perform their duties properly any more,\nfor far-seeing Zeus strips away half the proper worth\nfrom any man, once the day of slavery overtakes him.”\nSo saying, he went on into the pleasantly sited building\nand made straight for the hall to join the noble suitors.\nBut Argos the fated lot of black death overwhelmed\nonce he’d seen Odysseus again, in the twentieth year.\nGodlike Telemachos was the first by far to notice\nthe swineherd advancing through the house, and at once\ninvited him with a nod. Eumaios looked round and seized\na nearby stool, on which the carver would sit to cut\nall the portions of meat for the suitors feasting there\nin the hall. This he took and placed at Telemachos’ table,\nopposite him, and sat down himself. A herald now set\na portion of meat before him, with bread from a basket.\nVery soon after him Odysseus entered the building\nas he was, in the guise of a miserable aged beggar\npropped on a staff, wearing mean and threadbare clothes.\nHe sat down on the ash-wood threshold inside the doorway,\nleaning back on the doorpost of cypress, which long ago\na craftsman had skillfully planed and made true to the line.\nTelemachos now beckoned the swineherd over to him,\ntook a whole loaf from the exquisite basket, together\nwith all the meat he could pick up in both hands, and said:\n“Take this, a gift for the stranger. Tell him he should himself\ngo round among all the suitors, begging. Embarrassed restraint\nis not a useful emotion for a man who’s in need.”\nSo he spoke;\nthe swineherd, on hearing his order, went up to Odysseus,\nand standing close, addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Stranger, Telemachos gives you this, says you should\ngo round among all the suitors, begging. Embarrassed restraint\nis not a useful emotion, he says, for a man who begs.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Zeus, lord, grant that Telemachos prosper among his peers,\nand may all that his heart desires be accomplished for him.”\nWith that he received the food in both hands and laid it\ndown at his feet on his tattered old leather bag and ate\nwhile the minstrel was still performing there in the hall.\nBut when he’d eaten dinner, and the divine minstrel was done,\nthe suitors’ noisy clamor resumed in the hall. Now Athene,\nstanding close beside Odysseus, Laertes son, urged him on,\nto go round among the suitors, collect his crusts of bread,\ndiscover which were right-thinking, which lawless. Yet even so\nshe’d no plan to save a single one of them from destruction.\nOff he went to beg of them, moving from left to right,\nwith outstretched hand all round, as though he’d long been at it.\nThey felt pity, and gave, and regarded him with wonder,\nquestioning who he might be, and where he came from.\nThe goatherd Melanthios now addressed them, saying:\n“Listen to me, you suitors of our illustrious queen!\nAbout this stranger: I’ve actually seen him before—in fact\nit was the swineherd who brought him back here, but I\ndon’t know the man himself, or who he claims as family.”\nSo he spoke. Antinoos then chastised the swineherd, saying:\n“You infamous swineherd, why did you bring this fellow\nhere into town? Don’t we have enough vagrants already,\nthese tiresome beggars who disrupt our feasts? Is it not\nenough for you that such men should cluster here and guzzle\nour lord’s livelihood, that you bring in this fellow too?”\nTo him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“High-born you may be, Antinoos, but that was not well said.\nFor who’d himself seek out and invite any stranger\nfrom abroad, except maybe some kind of public worker—\na prophet, a healer of sickness, a carpenter—even a godlike\nminstrel, who gives delight with his singing? Such men\nare invited worldwide on mankind’s boundless earth,\nbut no man would bring in a beggar to devour his substance!\nYou’re always too severe, more than the rest of the suitors,\non Odysseus’ servants, on me above all—although\nI don’t care, so long as prudent Penelope and godlike\nTelemachos are here, both still living in these halls.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Silence! Never waste words in answering this man!\nAntinoos has an old habit of meanly provoking people\nwith his rough language, and urges others to do the same.”\nThat said, he addressed Antinoos with winged words, saying:\n“Antinoos, truly you care for me like a father his son, the way\nyou tell me to drive this stranger away from our halls with words\nof enforcement! May no god bring this about! Take something,\nand give it him! Far from begrudging you, I command it!\nDon’t worry about my mother, or the rest of the household\nservants resident here in the house of godlike Odysseus!\nBut in fact this isn’t the kind of thought in your breast:\nyou’d far rather eat yourself than give to somebody else.”\nTo him then in turn Antinoos responded: “Telemachos,\nhigh-flown speaker, in anger unbridled, what’s this you said?\nIf all the suitors would offer him just what I do, then\nfor three months this house would keep him at a distance!”\nSo saying, he seized and brought out from beneath the table\nthe footstool on which he rested his sleek feet while feasting.\nThe others, more generous, filled Odysseus’ old bag\nwith crusts and meat. Now Odysseus was on his way\nback to the entrance, after making free trial of the Achaians,\nbut he stopped by Antinoos, and said to him: “Give, friend!\nYou don’t look to me like the meanest of the Achaians,\nbut rather the noblest, for you have the air of a king!\nSo it’s right that you should give me an even larger portion\nof food than the rest, and I’d spread your fame worldwide!\nFor I too once dwelt in my own rich house among other\nprosperous men, and I often would give to a vagrant,\nno matter what sort he was or what he might be lacking!\nCountless servants I had, and much else in abundance\nowning which men live well, and are known as wealthy.\nBut Kronos’ son Zeus lost me all—on some whim, I suppose—\nby inciting me to go off, with a bunch of roving pirates\nto Egypt—a lengthy voyage—and meet my ruin there.\nWell, in the river of Egypt I anchored my curved vessels.\nThen I issued orders to my trusty comrades, to stay\nthere with the ships, and to be those ships’ protectors\nwhile I sent off scouts to find and man lookout posts.\nBut, trusting their strength, they yielded to wanton aggression,\nand at once began ravaging the Egyptians’ splendid fields,\ncarrying off their wives and their little children,\nand killing the men. Word quickly reached the city,\nand, hearing the shouting, people came out at daybreak.\nThe whole plain filled up with infantry and horses\nand the bright glint of bronze. Zeus, hurler of thunderbolts,\ncast a craven panic upon my comrades: nobody dared\nto stand firm and face the foe, for trouble confronted us\non every side. Many of us they slew with the sharp bronze;\nothers they led off alive, to do forced labor for them.\nBut me they sent on to Cyprus with a chance-met stranger,\nDmetor, Iasos’ son, a powerful Cypriot prince.\nFrom there I’ve come here, with much hardship on the way.”\nTo him Antinoos then responded, saying: “What god\nhas delivered this nuisance, this spoiler of feasts, to us?\nYou, keep your distance, stand well away from my table,\nor you’ll soon find yourself in a bitter Egypt and Cyprus,\nthe right place for the bold and shameless beggar you are!\nYou make your pitch to each man in turn, and they give\nthoughtlessly, since there’s no restraint and no compunction\nin handing out other men’s stuff, and everyone has so much.”\nAt this resourceful Odysseus took a step back, and said:\n“I see your mind’s no match for your looks! You wouldn’t\nspare even salt from your home store for your own suppliant,\nand though at another man’s table, you’re still reluctant\nto break off a crust and give it me! Yet there’s plenty here.”\nSo he spoke, and Antinoos grew yet more enraged at heart.\nStaring angrily, he addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Indeed, you’ll no longer get safely back, I think,\nout through this hall, now you’re bandying insults too.”\nSo saying, he threw the footstool, struck Odysseus’ right shoulder\nat the base, where it joins the back; but he stood rock firm.\nAntinoos’ missile failed to floor him. He said nothing,\njust shook his head, mind deeply pondering trouble. Then\nhe made his way back to the threshold and seated himself,\nand set down his well-filled bag, and addressed the suitors, saying:\n“Listen to me, you suitors of the illustrious queen,\nto what the heart in my breast now urges me to tell you!\nThere’s no pain felt by the mind, nor any sorrow, when\na man takes a hit who’s fighting to save his own possessions—\ncattle, maybe, or flocks of white sheep—but Antinoos\nstruck me because of my wretched belly, that damnable\nplague, the source of so much trouble for mankind!\nIf beggars have their own gods or Furies, then may death’s\nend find Antinoos before ever he comes to marriage!”\nThen Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, responded to him, saying:\n“Sit still and eat quietly, stranger, or go off somewhere else,\nor the young men may seize you, by hand or foot, for the way\nyou talk, and tear you apart, and throw you out of the house.”\nSo he spoke, indignant and headstrong, but they all rebuked him,\nand thus would one of these overproud youths address him:\n“Antinoos, you did wrong to strike this luckless vagrant!\nIf he turns out to be some god from heaven, you’re done for!\nAnd the gods do assume the form of some stranger from afar,\ntake on any shape, to wander through our cities\nobserving both good governance and its violent transgressions.”\nSo spoke the suitors; but he paid no heed to their words,\nand Telemachos nursed great sorrow at heart because\nof the blow to his father, yet shed no tear on the ground\nbut just shook his head, mind deeply pondering trouble.\nWhen prudent Penelope was informed about the assault\non the man in the hall, she exclaimed, among her handmaids:\n“May Apollo, renowned archer, so strike you yourself!”\nTo her then responded Eurynome, the housekeeper, saying:\n“Would that our prayers might find fulfillment! Then not\none of these men would live till another fine-throned Dawn.”\nPrudent Penelope replied to her, saying: “Good mother,\nthey’re all our enemies, since they’re plotting trouble for us;\nbut Antinoos is the worst, he’s like black death!\nSome luckless stranger’s been going round in the house\nbegging from all the men, driven to it by poverty.\nAll the rest gave him enough to fill his bag, but this man\nthrew a footstool and struck him, low down on his right shoulder.”\nSuch her words while she sat in her room, conversing\nwith her handmaids, and noble Odysseus was eating his scraps.\nThen she sent for the noble swineherd, and addressed him, saying:\n“Go now, noble Eumaios, invite this stranger here:\nI’d like to show him some kindness—and ask him if perhaps\nhe’s had has some news of steadfast-minded Odysseus,\nor has actually seen him: he seems to be widely traveled.”\nThen to her, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Indeed, my queen, I could wish these Achaians would be silent,\nhe spins such a tale as would enchant your very soul!\nThree nights I had him with me, and three days I kept him\nin my hut—he first came to me after he jumped ship,\nbut that wasn’t the end of the tale of hardship he told me.\nLike the man gazing rapt at a minstrel performing lays that\nhe’s learned from the gods for the entrancement of mortals,\nwho are ceaselessly eager to hear him, whenever he sings—\nthat’s how this fellow charmed me as he sat in my home.\nHe says he’s a family guest-friend of Odysseus, and dwells\nin Krete, that place where the line of Minos holds sway.\nNow he’s come here from there, with much hardship on the way,\nwandering ever onward. He’s had news of Odysseus, he says:\nquite near, in the Thesprotians’ rich terrain, alive,\nand bringing much treasure back with him to his home.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Go, summon him! He can tell me all this, face to face.\nAs for these men sitting outside or here indoors, enjoying\na good time, let them go on, since that’s their fancy!\nTheir own possessions, bread and sweet wine, are left\nuntouched in their homes, and are eaten by their servants,\nwhile they themselves, day in day out, flock to our house,\nslaughter our cattle and sheep and fatted goats, hold feasts\nat which they swill down our bright red wine without\nany restraint. Most is gone now, for there is no man here\nsuch as Odysseus once was, to keep ruin from our house.\nBut were Odysseus to come back home, then he and his son\nwould at once exact vengeance for these men’s violent acts.”\nSo she spoke. Telemachos now sneezed, loudly. The whole\nhouse echoed ringingly round them. Penelope laughed,\nand at once addressed Eumaios with winged words, saying:\n“Please go now and bring the stranger here before me!\nDon’t you see how my son just sneezed at everything I said?\nIt follows that death shall not be unfulfilled for the suitors—\nto the last man: not one shall escape death and the fates.\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nIf I find that in all he relates he speaks only truth,\nthen I’ll dress him in mantle and tunic, the very best there are.”\nSo she spoke. The swineherd went, on hearing her words,\nto Odysseus, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Stranger, father, prudent Penelope wants to see you—\nTelemachos’ mother: her heart bids her make enquiries\nabout her husband, although she’s suffered much already.\nIf she finds that in all you relate you speak only truth,\nthen she’ll dress you in mantle and tunic—things of which\nyou stand much in need! As for food, go beg through the land\nto keep your belly well fed: those who so choose will give.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“In a moment, Eumaios, I’ll be relating the whole truth\nto Ikarios’ daughter, the prudent Penelope! My knowledge\nof Odysseus is sound, and we’ve borne like hardships. But\nI’m much afraid of this crowd of dangerous suitors,\nwhose aggression and violence reach up to the iron heaven!\nFor just now, as I went through the hall, doing no harm,\nthis man struck me, causing much pain, yet neither\nTelemachos nor anyone else came out to protect me.\nSo tell Penelope she must wait in the halls, however\nimpatient she may be, until the sun goes down:\nthen let her ask me about the day of her husband’s return,\nand give me a seat that’s nearer the fire, since my clothes\nare threadbare. You know this yourself: I appealed to you first.”\nSo he spoke. The swineherd then, after hearing his words,\nwent back in. Penelope at once addressed him, saying:\n“You haven’t brought him, Eumaios! What’s this vagrant up to?\nIs he scared without reason of someone, or maybe embarrassed\nhere in the house? Embarrassment makes a useless beggar.”\nTo her then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“What he says is well chosen, as anyone else would agree:\nhe hopes to avoid the violence of these arrogant men,\nso he wants you to wait to see him until the sun goes down.\nFor yourself too, my queen, it would indeed be far better\nto speak with the stranger, and hear what he says, alone.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“This stranger’s not witless: he figures how things may go.\nFor there may well be no other mortal men alive\nwho in their violence contrive such reckless acts as these.”\nSo she spoke, and the noble swineherd then departed\nand joined the throng of the suitors after he’d told her all.\nAt once he addressed winged words to Telemachos, head\nheld close, so that nobody else could hear him, saying:\n“Friend, I’m off out there now to guard the pigs and the rest—\nyour and my livelihood. You take charge of everything here.\nAbove all, keep yourself safe, take good care you don’t run\ninto trouble: many Achaians now have it in for you—\nmay Zeus destroy them utterly before harm can befall us!”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Old fellow, so it shall be. Off you go when you’ve had some food.\nBut come back tomorrow with fine sacrificial victims!\nAll here will be cared for by me. And by the immortals.”\nSo he spoke. The swineherd sat down again on a polished\nchair, and when he’d satisfied his desire for food and drink,\nhe went back to his pigs, leaving the courts and the hall\nfull of banqueters. Now they began to enjoy themselves with\ndancing and singing, for already the evening had arrived.\n",

         "\nThe man, Muse—tell me about that resourceful man, who wandered\nfar and wide, when he’d sacked Troy’s sacred citadel:\nmany men’s townships he saw, and learned their ways of thinking,\nmany the griefs he suffered at heart on the open sea,\nbattling for his own life and his comrades’ homecoming. Yet\nno way could he save his comrades, much though he longed to—\nit was through their own blind recklessness that they perished,\nthe fools, for they slaughtered the cattle of Helios the sun god\nand ate them: for that he took from them their day of returning.\nTell us this tale, goddess, child of Zeus; start anywhere in it!\nNow the rest, all those who’d escaped from sheer destruction,\nwere home by now, survivors of both warfare and the sea;\nHim alone, though longing for his homecoming and his wife,\nthe queenly nymph Kalypso, bright among goddesses,\nheld back in her hollow cavern, desiring him for her husband.\nBut when the year arrived, with its circling seasons, in which\nthe gods had ordained he should make his homeward journey\nto Ithake, not even then would he be free of trials,\neven among his own people. All the gods felt pity for him\nexcept for Poseidon, who still nursed unabated wrath\nagainst godlike Odysseus until he reached his native land.\nBut now Poseidon was visiting the remote Aithiopians—\nwho live in two sundered groups, both at mankind’s frontiers,\nthe one at Hyperion’s setting, the other where he rises—\nto receive from them a full sacrifice of bulls and rams,\nand was sitting there at the feast, enjoying himself: the other\ngods were all assembled in the halls of Olympian Zeus.\nDiscussion was started among them by the Father of men and gods,\nwho’d been brooding in his heart over handsome Aigisthos,\nslain by far-famed Orestes, the son of Agamemnon:\nwith him in mind he now spoke among the immortals, saying:\n“My oh my, the way mortals will fasten blame on the gods!\nFrom us, they say, evils come, yet they themselves\nthrough their own blind recklessness have ills beyond\ntheir fated lot, as lately Aigisthos—beyond his fated lot—\nkilled Atreus’ son at his homecoming, married his wife,\nthough he knew this meant sheer destruction, since we’d told him\nbefore the event, sending Hermes, the sharp-eyed Argos-slayer,\nhe should neither slay the man nor marry his bedfellow,\nsince vengeance for Atreus’ son would come from Orestes\nonce he’d reached manhood, and longed for his own country.\nSo Hermes said; but he failed, for all his good intentions,\nto dissuade Aigisthos, who now has paid the full penalty.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Our father, son of Kronos, highest above all rulers,\nthat man indeed was destroyed by well-merited disaster—\nso may all others perish who commit such crimes!—\nbut my heart is distressed on account of clever Odysseus,\nthat ill-fated man, who, far from his dear ones, has long\nsuffered griefs on a sea-ringed island, where the sea’s navel is:\na tree-rich island, and a goddess has her home there,\nthe daughter of crafty-minded Atlas, who knows the depths\nof every sea, who in person shoulders those lofty\npillars that keep earth and firmament apart from each other.\nHis daughter it is who detains that luckless, sorrowful man,\nforever beguiling him with soft and wheedling words\nto forget his island, Ithake. Yet Odysseus, in his yearning\nto perceive were it only the smoke rising up into the sky\nfrom his homeland, longs now for death. But your own heart\ncares nothing for him, Olympian! Did not Odysseus\nby the Argives’ ships honor you with the sacrifices he made\nin the broad land of Troy? Why, Zeus, do you hate him so?”\nCloud-gatherer Zeus responded to her, saying: “My child,\nwhat’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth?\nNow how could I ever forget the godlike Odysseus,\nwho for mind surpasses all mortals, who’s sacrificed most\nto the deathless gods who possess the wide firmament? No,\nit’s Poseidon, the Earth-Shaker, whose fury with him is relentless,\nunceasing, because of the Kyklops, whose eye he blinded—\nthe godlike Polyphemos, whose strength is the mightiest\namong all the Kyklopes: the nymph Thoosa bore him,\ndaughter of Phorkys who rules the unharvested sea,\nfor there in the hollow sea caves she lay with Poseidon.\nThat’s why Earth-Shaker Poseidon is wroth with Odysseus:\nnot killing him, but forever frustrating his homeward journey.\nSo come, let all of us here give some thought to his return,\nhow to get him home safely: Poseidon will have to abandon\nhis rage, he won’t be able, with all the immortals united\nagainst him, to strive alone, lacking the gods’ goodwill.”\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Our father, son of Kronos, highest above all rulers,\nif indeed it is now agreeable to the blessed gods\nthat quick-witted Odysseus should return to his own home,\nlet us then dispatch Hermes, the guide, the slayer of Argos,\nto the isle of Ogygia, so that as soon as may be\nhe can inform the fair-tressed nymph of our firm decision\non steadfast-minded Odysseus: that he’s to return home.\nI meanwhile will go to Ithake, approach his son,\nput more strength in his heart, give him the courage\nto summon the long-haired Achaians to assembly, and make\na strong case to the suitors, who without cease slaughter\nhis flocks of sheep and his shambling, crumple-horned cattle;\nand then I’ll send him to Sparta and sandy Pylos, to seek\nnews of his father’s homecoming—he may learn something—\nand win a good reputation among men at large.”\nSo she spoke,\nand bound on her elegant sandals under her feet,\nimmortal, golden, that bore her both over the sea\nand across the boundless earth, as swift as the wind’s blast;\nand she took her brave spear, so massive, thick and strong,\nits tip of sharp bronze, with which she routs the ranks of men,\nheroes against whom she, a strong sire’s daughter, is wroth,\nand took off, down from the heights of Olympos, landing\non Ithake, right before Odysseus’ outer entrance,\nhis courtyard’s threshold, still grasping the bronze spear,\nin the guise of a stranger, the Taphian leader Mentes.\nThere she found the bold suitors. They at the time\nwere amusing themselves with board games out of doors,\nseated on hides of oxen they themselves had slaughtered,\nwhile heralds and henchmen were busy on their behalf,\nsome mixing wine and water for them in bowls,\nwhile others were swabbing the tables with porous sponges\nand setting them out, or carving meat in lavish helpings.\nBy far the first to see her was godlike Telemachos,\nwho was sitting among the suitors, sorely vexed at heart,\nin his mind’s eye seeing his noble father, how he might\nreturn, make a scattering of the suitors through his domain,\nand himself gain honor, be king of his own possessions.\nThinking thus, there among the suitors, he noticed Athene,\nand went at once to the forecourt, embarrassed at heart\nthat a guest had to wait outside. He stood beside her,\nclasped her right hand, took charge of the bronze spear,\nand addressed her with winged words, saying: “Greetings, stranger!\nAs a guest you’re welcome among us, and afterwards, when\nyou’ve shared our meal, then explain to us what it is you need.”\nThat said, he led the way, and Pallas Athene followed.\nWhen they entered the lofty house, Telemachos carried\nher spear across and stood it beside a tall pillar, in\na polished spear rack, where many more spears were standing,\nthat belonged to steadfast Odysseus. Athene herself\nhe led and had sit down in a backed chair, spreading\na cloth on it first: a finely wrought chair, with footstool,\nand beside it an inlaid seat for himself, away from the others,\nthe suitors, lest his guest, irritated by their uproar,\nshould be put off his food, among such arrogant men—\nand besides, he wanted to ask him about his absent father.\nThen a handmaid brought water for them in an exquisite\ngolden pitcher, poured it into a silver basin, so they\ncould rinse their hands, then set a polished table beside them,\nand a grave housekeeper brought them bread, and with it\nappetizers galore, giving freely of what was to hand,\nwhile a carver made up and sent them platefuls of meat\nof every kind, and set by them golden goblets, while\na herald went to and fro to furnish them with wine.\nThen in came the arrogant suitors, and all immediately\nsettled themselves in rows on the seats and benches,\nand heralds now poured water over their hands, while maids\nbrought them bread by the basketful, and youths\nfilled the bowls to the brim with drink for them, and they\nreached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nthe suitors’ minds now turned to other pleasures,\nto singing and dancing, a feast’s proper complement,\nand a herald brought out for Phemios his well-tuned lyre—\nhe sang for the suitors only because he was forced to—\nand he struck a chord, introducing his own fine song.\nBut Telemachos now spoke to grey-eyed Athene, leaning\nhis head close to hers, so that no one else could hear him:\n“Dear stranger, would you be shocked by what I tell you?\nAll these men care about is music and singing, easy enough\nfor them—they’re freeloading off another man’s livelihood,\na man whose white bones may be rotting in the rain\naway on the mainland, or rolled by the sea’s breakers.\nIf they were to see him, if he ever returned to Ithake,\nthey’d all be praying that they could run away faster, not\nas now, that they were richer in gold and expensive clothes!\nBut no, he must have suffered a wretched fate, nor is there\nany comfort for us, not even should someone, somewhere,\nclaim he’ll come back: his day of returning’s perished.\nBut now tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\nWho are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\nOn what kind of ship did you come here? How did sailors\nbring you to Ithake? What place do they say they’re from?\nFor I don’t imagine you made your way here on foot!\nAnd tell me this truly too, that I may be certain of it:\nIs this your first visit here, or are you one of my father’s\nguest-friends? Many the men who used to visit our home,\njust as he too traveled widely among mankind.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“So, I’ll answer the questions you asked me fully and truthfully.\nI declare I am Mentes, wise Anchialos’ son,\nand that I rule the Taphians, master rowers; and now,\nas you see, I’ve put in here by ship, with my companions,\nsailing the wine-dark deep to meet men of foreign speech,\non my way to Temese for copper, with a cargo of gleaming iron.\nMy ship’s out there, by the countryside, far from the city,\nin the harbor of Rheithron, down below wooded Neion.\nGuest-friends of each other Odysseus and I claim we are\nfrom way back—you can go ask that elderly hero\nLaertes, who, they say, no longer comes to the city,\nbut far away in the backwoods has a hard existence\nwith one old woman servant, who sees to his victuals and drink\nwhen exhaustion steals over and weakens his limbs as he\nshuffles along the high slope of his patch of vineyard.\nSo now I’ve come, for indeed word had it that your father\nwas back home; but the gods must be thwarting his return,\nsince not yet has he died in this world, the noble Odysseus,\nbut still lives, perhaps held prisoner, out on the vast deep\nin some sea-girt island, kept there by violent men,\nwild savages, who, most likely, are holding him under duress.\nBut I shall now make a prediction for you, just as the immortals\nput it into my mind—and I think it will come to pass,\nthough I am no seer, have no clear knowledge of bird-signs!\nNot much longer will he be away from his own beloved\ncountry, no, not even if iron bonds restrain him—he’ll\nfind a way to return, this man of many resources!\nBut now tell me this, and declare it to me truly,\nif indeed, big as you are, you’re Odysseus’ own son—because\nyour head and fine eyes bear an amazing resemblance\nto his: many the hours we spent with one another\nbefore he embarked for Troy, like so many others,\nthe finest of the Achaians, in the hollow ships, and set forth.\nBut since then I’ve not seen Odysseus, nor he me.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“So, stranger, I’ll give you a full and truthful answer.\nMy mother says I’m his child, but for my own part\nI cannot tell: never yet did any man know his begetting!\nIndeed, I could wish I’d been the son of some fortunate\ngentleman, taken by age while among his own possessions!\nBut truth is, it was the most ill-fated of mortals who,\nso they say, begot me—since you’re asking about this matter.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“No nameless lineage, surely, did the gods decree for you\nhereafter, since such as you are you were born to Penelope!\nBut now tell me this, and declare it to me truly:\nWhat party, what gathering’s this? What’s your concern with it?\nA feast, is it? Or a wedding? No communal dinner, surely?\nThe riotous, arrogant manner in which, as it seems to me,\nthey are carrying on in your house! A man might well take offense,\nwalking in on this shameful behavior—any decent man, that is.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Since, stranger, you ask this, and question me on these matters,\nour household once looked to be rich and respectable,\nso long as that certain man was here among his people;\nbut now the gods have willed otherwise, have planned misfortune,\nhave vanished him utterly, as they’ve done to no other man\never—I wouldn’t be grieving so over his death\nhad he fallen alongside his comrades upon Trojan soil\nor expired in his friends’ arms after winding up the war!\nThen all the Achaians would have made him a burial mound,\nand great glory would have been his, and his son’s, hereafter.\nBut now, ingloriously, the storm winds have swept him away.\nHe’s gone, out of sight, out of knowledge, leaving me pain and sorrow\n—and it’s not on his sole account that I’m lamenting now,\nsince the gods have inflicted other harsh troubles on me.\nAll those highborn leaders who lord it over the islands—\nDoulichion and Same and forested Zakynthos,\nbesides those who rule as princes over rocky Ithake—\nare all paying court to my mother, and devouring our property.\nYet she neither refuses this hateful marriage, nor can she make\nan end of the business, while they with feasting keep on\neating away our substance: very soon they’ll destroy me too.”\nOutraged by his statement, Athene responded, saying:\n“It’s true, you’re in urgent need of the vanished Odysseus,\nto come and lay hands on these shameless suitors!\nHow I wish he’d appear now, here at your outer gate,\narmed with helmet and shield and a brace of spears,\nthe way he was the first time I set eyes upon him,\nin our house, drinking wine and enjoying himself, on his way\nback from Ephyre, where he’d gone to see Ilos, Mermeros’ son.\nOdysseus had voyaged there aboard his speedy vessel\nin search of a lethal poison that he wanted to get\nto smear the bronze tips of his arrows. But Ilos refused\nto give it him, fearing the wrath of the gods that are forever;\nyet my father did, for he loved the man most dearly.\nIf only Odysseus might come, thus arrayed, among the suitors!\nThey’d all find a quick death then, and a bitter marriage.\nBut of course all this rests on the knees of the gods—\nwhether or not he’ll return and exact full retribution\nin his own halls. But I urge you yourself to consider\nhow you might drive out these suitors from your household,\nso pay attention now, mark carefully what I tell you.\nTomorrow call an assembly of the Achaian heroes:\nSpeak your mind to them all, let the gods be your witnesses!\nTell the suitors all to disperse, to go back home;\nAnd if your mother’s heart is urging her toward marriage,\nshe should return to her powerful father’s domain,\nwhere they’ll set up the wedding and arrange the bride-gifts,\nlots of them, all that’s fitting to go with a much-loved daughter.\nAnd for you yourself wise advice, if you’ll take it: man a ship,\nthe best you have, with twenty rowers, and go\nto seek news of your father, who’s been so long absent,\njust in case some person can tell you, or you pick up a rumor\nfrom Zeus, the most common way that mortals gather tidings.\nGo first to Pylos, interrogate noble Nestor,\nand from there to Sparta, to fair-haired Menelaos,\nfor he was the last of all the bronze-corseleted Achaians\nto get home. If you hear that your father’s alive, and on his\nway back, then, though beleaguered, hold on for another year;\nbut if you get word that he’s dead, no longer living,\nthen make your way back to your own dear country,\nraise him a burial mound, perform funeral rites at it—\nlavish ones, as is fitting—and find your mother a husband.\nThen, when all this business is over and done with,\nis the time to consider, in your mind and spirit,\nhow you might slaughter these suitors in your halls,\nwhether by guile or openly. It does not become you\nto persist in childish ways: you’re no longer a child.\nOr have you not heard what glory noble Orestes won\namong all mankind when he slew his father’s murderer,\ncrafty Aigisthos, for killing his famous father?\nYou too, my friend—for I see how handsome and tall you are—\nbe valiant, that men yet unborn may speak well of you!\nBut now I shall go back down to my swift ship,\nwhere my comrades must be waiting impatiently for me.\nSo think on these things, and pay heed to what I’ve told you.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Stranger, the words that you said were spoken considerately,\nas a father would speak to his son: I will never forget them.\nBut please do stay longer, though eager to be on your way,\nso that when you’ve had a bath and refreshed your spirit\nyou can go to your ship with a present, happy at heart—\nan expensive and beautiful gift, to be an heirloom for you\nfrom me, such as guest-friends exchange with one another.”\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Delay me no longer—I need to resume my journey:\nand whatever gift your heart incites you to give me,\ngive it me when I return here, to take back home. And choose\nsomething really precious: it’ll bring you its worth in exchange.”\nThat said, the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, departed,\nflying up through the skylight. Into his heart she set\ncourage and strength, and put him in mind of his father\neven more than before. Reflecting on what had happened\nhis mind was in awe: this must be a god, he thought.\nAt once he approached the suitors, a godlike mortal.\nFor them the far-famed minstrel was singing, and they\nsat listening in silence. His song recounted the Achaians’\nwretched homecoming from Troy, laid on them by Athene.\nFrom upstairs the marvelous tale was heard and pondered\nby Ikarios’ daughter, the prudent Penelope, who now\nwent down from her high bright upper chamber: not\nalone, for two of her handmaids followed in attendance.\nWhen she, bright among women, came where the suitors were,\nshe stood by the central post of the snugly timbered roof,\nholding up her shining veil in front of her face,\nand flanked on either side by a devoted handmaid,\nand then, in tears, addressed the godlike minstrel:\n“Phemios, much else you know to keep mortals spellbound—\ndeeds of men and of gods, made famous by minstrels:\ngive them one such song as you sit here, let them in silence\nstill drink their wine, but quit this lay you’re singing,\nso unhappy, it always agonizes the heart in my breast,\nsince on me beyond all others has come unforgettable\ngrief, for that much-loved being I picture with such longing—\nmy husband, of wide renown through Hellas and mid-Argos.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Mother, why do you begrudge so excellent a minstrel\nthe right to please in whatever way he chooses?\nIt’s not minstrels who are at fault, but Zeus, who deals out\nto bread-eating mortals whatever he likes for each.\nDon’t blame this bard for singing the Danaans’ grim fate:\nmen always show most enthusiasm for the newest lay\nthat’s performed with a view to enchant their listening ears!\nSo harden your mind and heart, be resigned to listen:\nIt was not Odysseus alone who lost his day of returning\nfrom Troy—many others perished, just as he did.\nSo go back to your room, get down to your regular tasks,\nat the loom, with the distaff; see to it that your handmaids\ndo their proper work too! But speechmaking is men’s business,\nand mine above all, since mine is the power in this household.”\nTaken aback, Penelope now withdrew to her chamber,\nand stored in her heart her son’s smart observations.\nUpstairs she went, her handmaids with her, and then\nwept for Odysseus, her own dear husband, until\ngrey-eyed Athene spread sweet sleep over her eyelids.\nBut the suitors created an uproar throughout the shadowy hall,\neach praying that he might be the one to bed and lie with her,\nand among them sagacious Telemachos was the first to speak:\n“You, my mother’s suitors, domineering and arrogant,\nfor now let us feast and enjoy ourselves, but please,\nno shouting! It’s a rare pleasure to be able to hear\na minstrel like this one, with a voice like that of the gods!\nBut tomorrow at dawn let’s go and be seated in assembly,\nall of us, where I’ll make you a forthright public request:\nGet out of my home! Go find other feasts for yourselves,\nconsume your own goods, move around from house to house!\nBut if this is what you regard as better, more profitable,\nto devour one man’s livelihood without offering compensation,\nthen gobble on! I’ll petition the gods who are forever,\nand maybe Zeus will grant me an occasion of reprisal,\nso that you, while still feasting for free in my halls, all perish!”\nSo he spoke; and all of them bit their lips hard, astonished\nat the way Telemachos had spoken out so boldly.\nAntinoos, son of Eupeithes, now addressed him, saying:\n“Telemachos, it must be the gods themselves who’ve taught you\nthis high-flown delivery, this audacious way of speaking!\nYou, king of sea-girt Ithake? May the son of Kronos never\ngrant you the throne, though it’s yours by ancestral right!”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Antinoos, what I now say may perhaps offend you.\nThis too I’d be glad to accept, were Zeus the giver:\ndo you think it the worst fate that could befall a man?\nTo be king’s no disaster: right from the start your domain\nIs enriched, and you yourself are held in greater honor.\nStill, there are many other princes of the Achaians,\nboth young and old, who dwell here in sea-girt Ithake:\nany one of them might get this, since noble Odysseus\nis dead. But I shall be lord over our own household,\nand the servants that noble Odysseus got as booty for me.”\nThen Eurymachos, son of Polybos, responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, all these matters rest on the knees of the gods—\nlike, which of the Achaians will be king in sea-girt Ithake!\nSo keep your possessions, lord it over your own household,\nand may the man never come here who’d deprive you by force\nof your possessions, as long as Ithake’s inhabited! Yet\nI’d like, my good friend, to ask you about that stranger—\nWhere did he come from? What country does he claim as his?\nWhere are his relatives, his family acres, to be found?\nDid he come here with news about your father’s return,\nor was it just to take care of some business of his own?\nThe way he took off and vanished, not even waiting\nto meet us—he didn’t look, though, like some common fellow.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Eurymachos, by now all hope for my father’s return\nhas perished. No longer do I trust rumors from any source,\nor give any heed to prophecies, such as my mother\nmight pick up from a seer that she’d invited home.\nAs for this stranger, he’s from Taphos, a friend\nof my father, he says, named Mentes, wise Anchialos’ son,\nand is lord of the Taphians, those master rowers.”\nSo spoke\nTelemachos; but in his heart he knew the immortal goddess.\nThe suitors now turned to dancing and the pleasures of song,\npursuing their revels until it was evening: only darkness\ninterrupted their merrymaking, only then\ndid each of them slope off homeward to take his rest.\nBut Telemachos made his way to the handsome courtyard,\nin a sheltering corner of which his chamber had been built,\nand sought his bed there, pondering much in his mind,\nescorted by his old nurse, who bore the lighted torches—\nfaithful Eurykleia, daughter of Ops, Peisenor’s son.\nLong ago she’d been bought by Laertes, at a good price,\nwhen she was still a young girl: twenty oxen, no less.\nHe respected her in his home no less than his loyal wife,\nbut never made love to her, for fear of his wife’s anger.\nSo now it was she who carried the lighted torches: of all\nthe servants she loved him most, had nursed him as a child.\nHe opened the door of his well-carpentered chamber,\nsat down on the bed and took off his soft tunic,\nthen placed it in the hands of this wise old woman, who\nnow folded and smoothed the tunic, hung it up\non a peg at the side of the corded bedstead, and went\nout of the chamber, pulled the door shut behind her\nwith its silver hook, and drew the bolt home by its thong.\nSo the whole night through, wrapped in a woolen blanket,\nhe brooded over the journey Athene had planned for him.\n",

         "\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nOdysseus’ dear son got up from the bed he’d slept in,\nput on his clothes, slung a sharp sword from one shoulder,\ntied on a pair of fine sandals under his sleek feet,\nand sallied forth from his chamber, in appearance like a god.\nAt once he issued orders to the clear-voiced heralds\nto call to assembly the long-haired Achaians. They made\nthe proclamation he ordered, and quickly the people gathered.\nWhen they were met together in a single body\nTelemachos now joined them, a bronze spear in one hand,\nnot alone, but accompanied by a pair of hunting dogs,\nand wondrous the grace that Athene now shed on him,\nso that the whole crowd watched him as he approached:\nhe sat in his father’s seat, and the elders made way for him.\nThe hero Aigyptios was the first among them to speak,\na man bent with age, of much varied experience.\nBesides, his dear son had accompanied godlike Odysseus\nto Ilion, rich in fine foals, aboard the hollow ships—\nthe spearman Antiphos: but the savage Kyklops had killed him\nin his hollow cave, the last of the crew to be eaten.\nHe had three other sons. One, Eurynomos, joined the suitors;\nthe remaining two looked after the family farmlands. And yet,\ngrieving and sorrowful, he couldn’t forget the lost one.\nIt was in tears for him that he now addressed the assembly:\n“Pay attention, men of Ithake, to what I shall now tell you!\nNot once have we met in assembly, there’s been no session\nsince noble Odysseus set sail in the hollow ships!\nWho, then, has summoned us now? What urgent need\nhas come upon one of our men, whether younger or older?\nHas he had some news about an impending attack\nthat he can explain to us, having heard it earlier?\nOr will he announce for debate some other public business?\nA fine man I think him, and blessed: may Zeus grant\na good fulfillment of whatever his heart desires.”\nSo he spoke, and Odysseus’ dear son rejoiced at the omen,\nnor remained seated longer, in his urgency to speak,\nbut stood up in mid-assembly, while the scepter was placed\nin his hands by the herald Peisenor, a man astute in counsel;\nand then he spoke, first addressing the old man:\n“Old sir, the man’s not far, as you’ll soon learn yourself:\nIt was I who summoned the people: this grief affects me most.\nI’ve had no news of any impending attack\nthat I can explain to you, having heard of it earlier;\nnor shall I announce for debate any other public business,\nbut rather my own needs, because of the double evil\nthat’s befallen my house: I’ve lost my noble father, who once\nwas king among you here, as gentle as any father;\nand now there’s a far worse plague, that will very soon\ndestroy my house altogether, consume my whole livelihood!\nMy mother, against her will, is being pestered by suitors,\nthe sons of those very men who are the noblest here!\nThey shudder at the idea of going rather to the house\nof her father, Ikarios, have him fix his daughter’s bride-gifts\nand betroth her to whom he will, to the man that he prefers;\ninstead, day in day out, they crowd into our house,\nslaughter our oxen and sheep, our fattest goats,\nhold an endless party, swill down our sparkling wine\nwithout restraint. Much is lost already, there’s no man\nsuch as Odysseus was, to save our house from ruin—\nwe ourselves lack the strength to defend it: in the event\nwe’d be shown up as wretched weaklings, unversed in prowess.\nYet indeed I’d defend myself, if the strength was in me,\nfor deeds not to be borne have been done, there’s nothing decent\nin the way my estate’s been destroyed! You should feel ashamed,\nembarrassed before the men in your neighborhood,\nthose who live near here! And beware of the gods’ wrath,\nlest outraged by evil actions they turn against you!\nBy Olympian Zeus I beseech you, and by Themis,\nwho both dissolves and convenes our mortal assemblies,\nforbear, my friends, leave me alone to pine away in bitter\nsorrow—unless it could be that my father, noble Odysseus,\nat some point in anger mistreated the well-greaved Achaians,\nand now you, in angry requital, are mistreating me by urging\nthese suitors on? For me it would be better by far\nwere you yourselves to consume my property and my cattle,\nbecause, if you did the eating, there might some day\nbe recompense—we’d hawk the story round town,\ndemanding back our possessions, till all were restored.\nBut this way you burden my heart with incurable agony.”\nSo he spoke in his anger, then threw down the scepter,\nand burst into tears. Now pity took hold of all the people.\nAll others kept silent; no one could bring himself\nto offer an angry rebuttal to Telemachos’ words:\nonly Antinoos replied to him, saying: “Telemachos,\nlofty orator, angry, outspoken—what is this charge\nyou’re trying to shame us with, put the blame on us?\nIt’s not the Achaian suitors who are guilty in your regard\nbut rather your own dear mother, so expert at deceit!\nFor it’s three years now, and will soon be four, she’s spent\ntoying with the passions in the Achaians’ hearts,\noffering hope to all, making promises to each one,\nand sending them messages, but herself planning otherwise.\nAnd here’s one other deception that she contrived:\nin her halls she set up a great loom and started weaving—\nvery broad was the web, fine of thread—and said to us then:\n‘You young men, my suitors now noble Odysseus is dead,\nbe patient, though eager to wed me, until I finish\nthis web: I should not want my woven work to be wasted—\na shroud for the hero Laertes, against that day\nwhen the grim fate of pitiless death shall overtake him:\nthen the local Achaian women won’t be able to blame me\nfor a man who’d won so much being left with no winding-sheet.’\n“So she spoke; and our proud hearts assented to what she said.\nFrom then on, day after day, she’d be weaving at the great loom,\nbut at night she’d have torches set up, and undo her work.\nThus for three years she beguiled and persuaded the Achaians;\nbut when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round,\nthen it was that one of her women, well aware of what she did,\ntold us, and so we caught her undoing her elegant web,\nand against her will she was forced to finish it. Thus\nthis is the suitors’ response to you, to the end that you\nand all the Achaians may have clear knowledge of it:\nsend your mother away, tell her to make a marriage\nwith whoever her father selects and whom she fancies!\nBut if she goes on tormenting the Achaians’ sons much longer,\nexploiting with forethought those talents Athene gave her—\nexpertise in fine handiwork, outstanding intelligence and\nsagacity, such as we’ve never yet heard ascribed\nto women of old, those fair-tressed Achaian ladies\nTyro, Alkmene, and garlanded Mykene,\nnot one of whom for shrewd planning could rival Penelope—\nthen at least in this matter she made a wrong decision,\nand they’ll go on devouring your livelihood and your stock\nso long as she holds to this purpose that the gods\nhave now put into her heart. She may be winning great fame\nfor herself, but for you regret over your lost plenty.\nAs for us, we’ll not disperse to our homes or anywhere else\nuntil she decides to wed whichever Achaian she picks.”\nSagacious Telemachos replied as follows: “Antinoos,\nI can’t just drive from this house—against her will—\nher who bore and reared me, while my father, alive or dead,\nis in some distant country! And to pay a great sum to Ikarios,\nas I must, if I throw out my mother, would be unfair on me.\nThus I’d get a bad deal from her father, besides which heaven\nwould add to my woes, since my mother on leaving our home\nwould invoke the foul Furies, and I’d be an object of public\ncontempt—so this is a word I shall never utter. And you all,\nif even your hearts are touched by guilt in this matter,\nget out of my home! Go find other feasts for yourselves,\nconsume your own goods, move around from house to house!\nBut if this is what you regard as better, more profitable,\nto devour one man’s livelihood without offering compensation,\nthen gobble on! I’ll petition the gods who are forever,\nand maybe Zeus will grant me an occasion of reprisal,\nso that you, while still feasting for free in my halls, all perish!”\nSo Telemachos spoke, and for him far-seeing Zeus\nsent two eagles flying down from a lofty mountain peak.\nFor a while they glided, riding upon the wind stream,\nside by side, close together, wings wide outspread; but when\nthey arrived at the midpoint of the many-voiced assembly,\nthen they circled over it, with a whirr of beating wings,\ntore each other’s cheeks and necks on both sides with their talons,\nlooking down, with death in their glance, on the heads of the crowd,\nthen sped off to the right, above their homes and city.\nAll were amazed by what they’d witnessed of these birds,\nhad much heart-searching as to what they might portend,\nand were now addressed by the aged hero Halitherses,\nMastor’s son, who excelled all men of his generation\nin his knowledge of bird-signs and at interpreting omens.\nHe, with friendly intent, now spoke before the assembly:\n“Listen well, you men of Ithake, to what I have to tell you!\nAnd the suitors above all should heed the message I bring,\nfor great troubles are rolling toward them, since Odysseus will not\nbe much longer away from his friends: already, I believe,\nhe may well be near, and devising slaughter and death\nfor them all! And for others in plenty he’ll mean trouble,\nwho dwell in sunny Ithake! But we should, well beforehand,\nthink of a way to stop them—or have them desist\nof themselves, since that’s a far better way for them.\nI’m no novice at prophesying, I have sure knowledge,\nand I declare that it’s all now coming true for that man\nexactly as I foretold when the Argives first sailed\nfor Ilion, and he, resourceful Odysseus, among them.\nHaving suffered much, with all his comrades lost,\nrecognized by nobody, after twenty years, I said,\nhe’d return home—and now all this is being fulfilled.”\nEurymachos, Polybos’ son, responded to him, saying:\n“Old man, go home, and prophesy to your children,\nlest they suffer some kind of misfortune in the future!\nFor this I’m a far more reliable prophet than you are.\nThere are birds in plenty that fly to and fro in the daytime,\nyet not all of them carry omens. As for Odysseus, he’s met\na distant death, and you should have perished with him—\nthen you wouldn’t be unloading all these predictions,\nor lending encouragement to Telemachos’ burst of temper,\nin the hope that he’ll reward you with a gift to your family!\nLet me speak plainly—and what I say will come to pass!\nIf you, given all the knowledge that age confers, beguile\na younger man with your words, encourage his resentment,\nfirst, this will make more trouble for the man himself.\n[He won’t get anything done alone, without assistance;]\nand on you, old sir, we’ll impose a penalty that your heart\nwill be in torment at paying, and bitter your agony!\nMy own advice to Telemachos, before you all, is this:\nLet him tell his mother to return to her father’s domain,\nwhere they’ll set up the wedding and arrange the bridal-gifts,\nlots of them, all that’s fitting to go with a much-loved daughter.\nFailing that, I don’t suppose that the sons of the Achaians\nwill abandon their burdensome wooing, since we fear no man—\ncertainly not Telemachos, for all his lengthy rant—\nnor shall we heed any predictions that you, old sir, may make:\nthey won’t come true, and you’ll be hated all the more!\nWhat’s more, his goods will continue to be devoured, without\ncompensation, so long as she continues to stall\nthe Achaians over her marriage! Here we are, kept waiting\nday after day, in rivalry for her virtue, never going\nafter other suitable women, such as each of us might marry.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Eurymachos, and the rest of you, all you noble suitors,\nover this I’ll entreat you no longer, nor discuss it further,\nsince by now the gods are aware of it, as are all the Achaians.\nSo give me a swift ship, along with twenty companions\nas crew on my journey, to both go there and come back.\nFor I’m off to Sparta and sandy Pylos, to enquire for\nnews about the return of my long-absent father.\nMaybe some mortal can tell me, or I can pick up a rumor\nfrom Zeus, the most common way that mortals gather tidings.\nIf I hear that my father’s alive, and on his way back,\nthen, though beleaguered, I’ll hold on for another year;\nbut if I get word that he’s dead, no longer living,\nthen I’ll make my way back to my own dear country,\nraise him a burial mound, perform funeral rites at it—\nlavish ones, as is fitting—and find my mother a husband.”\nThat said, he sat down, and there now stood up among them\nMentor, who’d been a comrade of peerless Odysseus.\nWhen Odysseus set out with his ships, he left him in charge\nof his household, under Laertes, to safeguard everything.\nHe, with friendly intent, now spoke before the assembly:\n“Listen well, you men of Ithake, to what I have to tell you!\nFrom now on let no kindness or gentleness be displayed\nby a sceptered king, let his heart not cherish what’s righteous—\nlet him rather be ever harsh, pursue injustice, since\nthere’s nobody now who remembers godlike Odysseus\nof the people whose lord he was, and kindly as a father!\nIt’s not these arrogant suitors I so much resent,\nfor their violent acts and their nasty-minded misconduct—\nthey risk their own lives by forcibly wolfing down\nOdysseus’ goods, and saying he’ll never return—\nno, it’s you, all the rest of the people, that I find fault with,\nfor sitting there silent, not speaking out roundly to stop\nthese suitors, though they are few, while you are many.”\nAgainst him Leokritos, son of Euenor, now spoke out:\n“Mentor, you mischief-maker, you’re crazy! What’s all this\ntalk about putting us down? It’d be a tough business\neven for more men than these to clamp down on our feasting!\nAnd what if Odysseus himself, the Ithakan, did return,\nto find these haughty suitors banqueting in his palace,\nand resolved in his heart to throw them all out? His wife\nwould get no joy of his homecoming, however deeply\nshe’d missed him: he’d suffer a shameful death on the spot\nif he fought outnumbered. Your threats lack reality!\nAnd you, good people, disperse now, each to his own affairs;\nand as for this fellow here, Mentor and Halitherses\nwill speed his departure—they’re old friends of his father’s!\nBut myself, I think he’ll just sit around listening to rumors\nright here in Ithake: he’ll never accomplish this journey!”\nWith that, he abruptly dismissed the assembly. They all\ndispersed at once, each man to his own house, except\nthe suitors, who went off to the house of godlike Odysseus,\nand Telemachos, who withdrew, alone, to the seashore,\nwashed his hands in the grey salt water, then prayed to Athene:\n“Hear me, you god who came yesterday to our home,\nand told me to travel by ship across the misty deep\nto seek news of my long-absent father’s return!\nNow all my plans are being held up by the Achaians,\nand, above all, by these viciously arrogant suitors!”\nSo he spoke in prayer, and Athene then approached him,\nassuming Mentor’s likeness in both voice and appearance,\nand addressed him as follows, uttering winged words:\n“Telemachos, you’ll turn out neither craven nor witless\nif indeed you’ve been imbued with your father’s rare strength—\nsuch a man he was, so masterful in both deeds and words!\nIn that case your journey won’t be useless or unfulfilled;\nbut if you’re not his son, his and Penelope’s, then\nI have no hope you’ll accomplish what you’re planning.\nFew are the sons who prove the equal of their fathers:\nmost are worth less, hardly any prove themselves better.\nBut since it would seem that you are neither craven nor witless,\nand that Odysseus’ resourcefulness hasn’t passed you over,\nthere is a fair chance that you will bring this business off!\nSo don’t worry about these suitors’ attitudes and notions—\nThey’re witless creatures, neither sensible nor right-thinking,\nand wholly unaware of the fact that death and black fate\nare very near, that on the same day they’ll all perish!\nBut for you that journey you’re planning is not far distant,\nso true a companion I am to your father’s family—\nI’ll fit you out a swift ship, accompany you myself.\nNow go back to the house, keep company with the suitors,\nmake ready provisions, pack them all in containers:\nthe wine in jars, and the barley meal, men’s marrow,\nin stout leather bags. Meanwhile, I’ll go through the town\nand find you a volunteer crew. As for ships, there are plenty\nhere in sea-girt Ithake, both old and new: of these\nI myself will select you the one that best suits your purpose,\nand we’ll soon fit her out, launch her into the open sea.”\nSo spoke Zeus’ daughter Athene. Telemachos did not\nlinger, after he’d heard the voice of the goddess,\nbut made his way back to the house, much troubled at heart,\nand found the proud suitors already there in his halls,\nbusy flaying goats and singeing fat hogs in the courtyard.\nAntinoos, laughing, came over, confronted Telemachos,\ntook his hand, and had this to say to him, speaking plainly:\n“Telemachos, lofty talker, angry, outspoken—no longer\nnurse in your heart any evil thoughts or actions,\nbut, please, eat and drink with us, as you did before!\nAll these things the Achaians will surely provide for you—\na vessel and hand-picked oarsmen, to give you a speedy\nvoyage to sacred Pylos, to seek news of your father.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Antinoos, there’s no way I could feast with you arrogant lot\nundistracted, much less enjoy myself in comfort!\nIs it not enough, you suitors, that in the past you devoured\nso much of my choice possessions, when I was still a child!\nBut now that I’m grown, and can figure the truth from what\nothers tell me, and passion is surging up within me,\nI’ll try directing the evil death-spirits against you, either\nby going to Pylos, or here in this district! But go I will,\nnor shall the journey I speak of be made in vain,\nthough I’m a passenger, lacking a ship and oarsmen\nof my own: this, I presume, was how you wanted it.”\nThat said, he withdrew his hand from the hand of Antinoos,\nlightly. Meanwhile the suitors, busy preparing dinner\nabout the house, made mock of him to each other,\nand this is how one of these arrogant youths would talk:\n“Oh, for sure, Telemachos must be planning our murder!\nHe’ll bring over helpers either from sandy Pylos\nor maybe from Sparta, he wants it so desperately—\nor he’s thinking of going to Ephyre, that rich plowland,\nto pick up some deadly poisons, bring them back here,\ndrizzle them into the wine bowl, and destroy us all!”\nAgain, another of these arrogant youths would announce:\n“Who knows? Maybe he himself, going off in his hollow ship,\nfar from his friends, will die wandering, like Odysseus!\nThat way he’d cause us even more trouble—we’d have\nto share out all his possessions, turn over the house\nto his mother to keep, and whoever it was she married.”\nSo they spoke. Telemachos now went down to his father’s storeroom,\nbroad and high-ceilinged, where gold and bronze lay piled,\nwith clothes in chests, an abundance of sweet-smelling oil,\nand jars of wine, well aged and sweet on the palate,\nholding within them an unmixed heavenly drink,\nset close together along the wall, for the day when Odysseus,\nafter laboring through much hardship, might come back home.\nThe close-carpentered double doors remained shut and locked,\nand both day and night a housekeeper kept watch there,\nguarding everything, both prudent and vigilant:\nEurykleia, daughter of Ops, Peisenor’s son. Her now\nTelemachos called to the storeroom, and addressed her, saying:\n“Good old nurse, please draw me off wine in two-handled jars—\nsweet wine, the best there is after what you’re keeping back\nfor him, the ill-fated one, just in case from heaven knows where\nZeus’ scion Odysseus returns, escaping death and the fates!\nFill me twelve jars, and fit them all with stoppers,\nand measure out barley into well-stitched leather bags—\nthere should be twenty measures of well-ground barley meal.\nHave all this taken care of. No one else is to know about it.\nI’ll pick up the load this evening, when my mother\ngoes to her upper chamber and retires for the night.\nFor I’m making a journey to Sparta and to sandy Pylos\nto seek any news I may learn about my dear father’s return.”\nSo he spoke, and his dear nurse Eurykleia shrieked aloud,\nand, lamenting, then addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Ah, how, dear child, did this thought ever enter your mind?\nWhere in this whole wide earth do you plan to go to, you,\nan only child and much loved? But Odysseus, scion of Zeus,\nhas already died, far from home, in some foreign country,\nand the moment you’re gone these men will make trouble for you,\ndestroy you by guile, and share out all your goods!\nStay here and look after what’s yours: you have no need\nto wander and suffer misfortunes on the unharvested sea.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Never fear, old nurse: this plan does not lack divine support!\nNow, promise you won’t say a word of it to my mother\nbefore eleven or twelve days have passed, or else until\nshe herself misses me and hears that I’ve set out—\nI don’t want her to spoil her fine complexion with weeping.”\nSo he spoke: the old woman swore a great oath, by the gods,\nthat she wouldn’t tell. When she’d sworn, and completed the oath,\nshe at once drew off the wine in two-handled jars,\nand measured the barley meal into well-stitched leather bags,\nwhile Telemachos went back to the hall and joined the suitors.\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another thought:\nin Telemachos’ likeness she went all around the city,\napproaching each man in turn with an identical message,\nthat they should assemble that evening alongside the swift ship.\nThat done, she then asked Noemon, illustrious son\nof Phronios, for a swift ship. He readily promised it her.\nSo the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow,\nand she drew the swift ship down to the sea, and left it\nwith all the gear that well-benched vessels carry,\nmoored at the harbor entrance. Beside it a doughty\ncompany gathered: the goddess put strength in each man there.\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another thought:\nshe made her way to the home of godlike Odysseus,\nand there shed sweet drowsiness over all the suitors\nas they drank, befuddled their wits, made them drop their cups.\nUp they got, to go home to bed: no longer did they\nsit on there, now sleep weighed heavy on their eyelids.\nThat done, to Telemachos grey-eyed Athene now spoke,\ncalled him out from his well-established domain,\nassuming the likeness of Mentor, in both form and voice:\n“Telemachos, already your well-greaved comrades are seated\nat their oars, ready and waiting for the start of your voyage!\nCome then, let’s go, no point in delaying your departure.”\nThat said, Pallas Athene now briskly led the way,\nand Telemachos followed behind, in the goddess’ footsteps.\nWhen they came down to the sea and the vessel, they found\ntheir long-haired comrades there, awaiting them on the shore,\nand Telemachos, princely in power, now addressed them, saying:\n“Come, friends, let us fetch the provisions: they’re all ready,\nback in the hall. My mother knows nothing of this,\nnor do her maidservants, except for the one I told.”\nSo saying, he led the way, and they accompanied him.\nThey carried back all the provisions, stowed them away\nin the well-benched ship, as Odysseus’ fine son commanded.\nThen Telemachos went aboard, preceded by Athene,\nwho sat herself down in the stern, and Telemachos came\nand sat down beside her. Men cast off the stern warps\nand scrambled aboard, and took their seats on the benches.\nNow grey-eyed Athene sent them a following wind,\na fresh west wind, loud-sounding over the wine-dark deep.\nTelemachos urged on his crew, gave them the order\nto haul on the sheets, and they obeyed his command.\nThey raised the fir-wood mast, set it upright in its hollow\nmast-block, firmly belayed the sheets to the forestays,\nthen hauled up the white sail with cords of plaited oxhide.\nThe wind bellied the mid-sail, and cleft by the cutwater\na dark surging wave sang aloud as the ship drove forward,\nshearing her path through the deep, accomplishing her journey.\nWhen they’d belayed the tackle in the swift black ship\nthey set out mixing bowls brimming with wine, and poured\nlibations to the immortal gods that are forever,\nand foremost of all to the grey-eyed daughter of Zeus.\nSo all night and into the dawn the vessel cut her course.\n",

         "\nDeserting the deep’s enchanting surface, the sun rose up\ninto the brazen sky to bring light both to immortals\nand to mortal beings upon the grain-rich plowland,\nand they came to Pylos, the well-built citadel of Neleus.\nHere, on the shore of the sea, sacrifices were being made\nof all-black bulls to the dark-haired Earth-Shaker. Nine\ncompanies there were, and five hundred men were seated\nin each, and each brought nine bulls. It was when they’d sampled\nthe innards and were burning thigh pieces for the gods\nthat the travelers arrived. They at once hauled up and brailed\nthe trim ship’s sail, moored her, and came ashore themselves.\nWith Athene leading the way, Telemachos disembarked,\nand the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, now first addressed him, saying:\n“Telemachos, you’ve no longer the least need for modesty—\nthe whole point of your voyage is to get news of your father:\nwhere he may have been buried, what kind of fate he met.\nBut for now, go straight up to Nestor, tamer of horses,\nand let’s find out what advice lies hidden in his breast!\nEntreat him yourself, have him tell you the true story—\na lie he won’t utter: he’s a most sagacious person.”\nSagacious Telemachos answered her in these words:\n“What, Mentor, must be my approach? How am I to greet him?\nI’ve no experience yet in subtle discourse; a young\nman feels embarrassed when interrogating his elders.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, there are some things you’ll figure out for yourself,\nand for others you’ll have divine guidance—I don’t think\nyou were born and raised without the gods’ good favor.”\nSo Pallas Athene spoke, and proceeded to lead the way\nbriskly, Telemachos following in the goddess’ footsteps,\nand they came to the Pylian men’s assembly and companies.\nThere Nestor sat with his sons, and around them their comrades\nwere preparing the feast, roasting some meat, had the rest on spits.\nBut when they spotted the strangers, they all came flocking\nto meet them, shook their hands, made them sit down.\nPeisistratos, Nestor’s son, was the first to reach them,\ntook them both by the hand, seated them at the feast\non soft sheepskins, there on the sandy seashore,\nnext to his father and Thrasymedes his brother,\ngave them helpings of innards, poured out wine\nin a golden cup, and addressed with welcoming words\nPallas Athene, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis:\n“Make your prayer now, stranger, to the lord Poseidon,\nfor his is the feast you have chanced upon, coming here.\nAnd when you have fittingly prayed and poured libations,\nthen give this man also the cup of honey-sweet wine\nto pour a libation, since he, too, I take it, prays\nto the immortals: all humans stand in need of the gods.\nStill, he is younger, and about the same age as I am:\nthat’s why to you first I now give this golden cup.”\nSo saying, he placed in her hand the cup of sweet wine,\nand Athene rejoiced at this man’s nice sense of decorum,\nin giving the golden cup to her first of all; and at once\nshe offered this heartfelt prayer to the lord Poseidon:\n“Hear me, Poseidon, Earth-Mover! Do not begrudge us\nfulfillment of all that our prayers are now requesting!\nOn Nestor, first and foremost, and his sons, bestow renown,\nand next, to the rest, to all Pylians, grant a pleasing\nrequital for this most splendid and generous sacrifice!\nGrant, too, that we may go home again, Telemachos and I,\nhaving achieved what we came here for in our swift black ship.”\nSo she prayed—and herself was bringing it all to pass.\nNow she gave to Telemachos the fine two-handled cup,\nand in like manner Odysseus’ dear son then prayed.\nWhen the outer meat was roasted, and off the spits, they next\ndivided the helpings, and shared in the sumptuous feast.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nthe first to speak was Nestor, the Gerenian horseman:\n“Now is a better time to interrogate these strangers,\nenquire who they are, now they’ve had their fill of food.\nSo, strangers, who are you? From where was it you sailed here\nover the watery ways? On business? Or are you reckless rovers,\ncruising the sea like pirates, who, at risk of their own lives,\ngo around making trouble for men from other lands?”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, greatly\nencouraged: Athene herself now put fresh confidence\ninto his heart, to enquire about his long-absent father,\n[and win a good reputation among men at large]:\n“Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaians,\nyou want to know where we come from? Then I shall tell you.\nWe’re here from that part of Ithake under Mount Neion,\nand the business I’ll speak of isn’t public, but personal.\nI’ve come to pursue any rumors about my father—\nthe noble, steadfast Odysseus, who once, they say,\nfighting alongside you, brought down the Trojans’ city.\nOf all the others who fought against the Trojans, we’ve since\nlearned how and where it was that each met his grim end;\nbut with him Kronos’ son has ensured that even his death’s\nunknown—no one can say for certain the place where he perished,\nwhether dispatched by enemies on the mainland\nor out on the deep, amid Amphitrite’s breakers.\nThat’s why I’m here at your knees now—you might be willing\nto tell me about his grim death, if you maybe saw it\nyourself, or heard an account of it from some other\nwanderer: to unmatched sorrow his mother bore him!\nAnd don’t, from concern or pity, speak false comfort to me,\nbut tell me exactly whatever you may have witnessed!\nI beseech you, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, made you\nany promise, by word or action, and delivered on it\nin the land of the Trojans, where you Achaians met grief,\nremember it now, and tell me the unerring truth of it.”\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, since you’ve recalled all the grief that we endured\nin that land—we, the dauntless sons of the Achaians!—\nwhether on board our ships, on the hazy deep, in pursuit\nof booty, wherever Achilles might choose to lead us,\nor our drawn-out struggle around King Priam’s great city—\nah, it was there that all our very best were slain!\nThere lies the warrior Aias, there lies Achilles, there\nPatroklos, a man who could match the gods in counsel;\nand there my own dear son, so strong and so virtuous—\nAntilochos, in the first rank as both runner and fighter.\nMany more ills we endured in addition to these: their sum\nwhat transient mortal could ever narrate in full?\nNot even were you to stay for five—no, six!—whole years\nwould you hear of all the woes the noble Achaians bore there—\nand before then, surfeited, you’d have gone back home for sure!\nNine years we were busy cobbling up trouble for them\nwith ruses of every sort: Kronos’ son took a weary age\nto finish the job! There no one tried to compete with noble\nOdysseus in scheming, since he far outstripped them all\nwith ruses of every sort—he, your father, if it’s really true\nthat you are his offspring! When I look at you I wonder,\nfor your way of speaking is like his, one would never think\nthat so young a man could speak in so proper a manner!\nThe whole time noble Odysseus and I were out there, neither\nin council nor in assembly did we oppose each other,\nbut, being of one mind, with good plans and shrewd judgment\nwe’d counsel the Argives on their best course of action.\nBut after we’d sacked the towering citadel of Priam\nand had sailed away, and a god had scattered the Achaians,\nthen indeed it was that Zeus planned a grim homecoming\nfor the Argives, since not all of them were either right-thinking\nor civilized: thus many met a bad end through the deadly\nwrath of the grey-eyed daughter of a mighty sire. It was she\nwho stirred up strife between the two sons of Atreus.\nThe two of them called an assembly of all the Achaians,\nthoughtlessly, not in due order, very close to sunset,\nand the Achaians’ sons arrived well loaded with wine\nto hear their speeches, and learn why they’d been summoned.\nNow Menelaos was urging the whole body of the Achaians\nto embark on the voyage home, over the sea’s broad back;\nbut this didn’t please Agamemnon at all: what he wanted\nwas to keep the army in place, and make lavish sacrifices\nto appease the dread wrath of Athene—fool that he was,\nnot knowing that she wouldn’t pay him the least attention,\nsince the mind of the gods eternal is not changed in a moment.\nSo the pair of them stood there, exchanging angry words,\nwhile the well-greaved Achaians sprang to their feet with a deafening\nclamor, and both these schemes collected their supporters.\nWe spent that night nursing harsh thoughts against\none another, while Zeus was devising a grief of evils. At dawn\nsome of us hauled our vessel down to the bright salt sea,\nand put aboard our possessions and our deep-sashed women;\nbut half of the force held back, remained in place there\nwith Atreus’ son Agamemnon, his people’s shepherd.\nSo half of us now embarked, and rowed out: swiftly our ships\nmoved on, for a god smoothed the monster-infested deep.\nWhen we reached Tenedos we sacrificed to the gods,\nlonging for home; but Zeus, not thinking yet of return—\nthe wretch!—rather stirred up bad strife for the second time!\nSome now brought their curved vessels around, sailed back\nwith lordly Odysseus—so clever, so subtle-minded—\nonce again showing favor to Atreus’ son Agamemnon;\nbut I, with the full squadron of ships that followed me,\nkept retreating—I realized the god was planning trouble!—\nas did Tydeus’ son too, Ares’ favorite, urging on his men,\nwhile, late in the day, there followed us fair-haired Menelaos,\nwho caught up with us at Lesbos, debating the long voyage—\nshould we set our course seaward, north of rocky Chios,\nby the island of Psyra, with Chios on our port side,\nor sail landward of Chios, past Mimas’ windswept headland?\nSo we asked the god to show us a sign, and he did,\nbidding us cut our way through the deep-sea route to Euboia,\nand thus the soonest get ourselves clear of misfortune.\nA good tailwind got up now and blew: our vessels ran\nswiftly across the sea’s fish-rich paths and reached\nGeraistos at night: to Poseidon we sacrificed many\nbulls’ thighs, grateful that we’d traversed the open water.\nIt was on the fourth day that the comrades of Diomedes\nthe horse breaker anchored their trim ships at Argos;\nbut I held on course for Pylos, nor did that good tailwind\ndrop once, from the time the god first set it on to blow.\nThus I came back, dear child, without news, nor do I know\nanything of the rest, which Achaians survived, which perished.\nBut such reports as have reached me while ensconced here at home\nI shall pass on, as is proper, and not conceal them from you.\nThe Myrmidons, those fierce spearmen, they say made it back,\nled by great-hearted Achilles’ illustrious son; back too\ncame Philoktetes, the distinguished offspring of Poias,\nwhile Idomeneus brought safely home to Krete all those\ncomrades surviving the conflict: the sea took none of them.\nAbout Atreus’ son you yourselves, though distant, will have heard:\nhow he returned, how Aigisthos devised a grim end for him.\nYet Aigisthos indeed was to pay a most terrible reckoning:\nso it’s good that when any man dies a son should survive,\nsince here was a son took revenge on his father’s killer—\nthe crafty Aigisthos, who’d murdered his famous father.\nYou too, my friend—for I see how handsome and tall you are—\nbe valiant, that men yet unborn may speak well of you!”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Nestor, Neleus’ son, great glory of the Achaians,\nthat man indeed got full vengeance, and the Achaians\nshall spread his fame far and wide, for men unborn to hear!\nIf only the gods would endow me with the strength\nto punish these suitors for their grievous transgression—\ntheir wanton insults, their malicious acts against me!\nBut no such good fortune have the gods ever assigned\nto me or my father: now I just have to endure.”\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, since by mentioning it you’ve reminded me of this,\nnumerous suitors, they say, for your mother’s hand, are there\nin your halls against your will, and making trouble for you.\nSo tell me, are you letting yourself be bullied, or do\nthe folk of the district, swayed by some god’s word, despise you?\nWho knows, one day he may come back, may be revenged,\neither alone, or with all the Achaians. If only grey-eyed\nAthene might choose now to love you as much as once,\nlong ago, she was concerned for renowned Odysseus\nin the land of the Trojans, where we Achaians suffered\nmuch hardship: for never I saw such open love from the gods\nas Pallas Athene showed him, standing openly at his side!\nIf she would love you as much, and care for you in her heart,\nthen some of these men would quite forget about marriage.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying\n“Old sir, I don’t think your words will ever find fulfillment:\nWhat you say is too much, I’m dumbfounded, what I hope for\ncould never happen, not even were the gods to will it so!”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, what’s this word has escaped your teeth’s barrier?\nA determined god could save a man easily, even from afar!\nI’d rather endure endless setbacks on the journey back\nbefore I got home, and saw the day of my returning,\nrather than make it there only to perish, as Agamemnon\nwas killed by Aigisthos’ treachery, and that of his own wife.\nYet death, that’s common to all, not the gods themselves\ncan ward off even from a man they love, whenever\nthe dire fate of pitiless death has once got hold of him.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“Mentor, despite our grief, let’s talk no more of these matters:\nFor him a return’s not reality now: long, long before this\nfor him the immortals will have contrived death and black fate.\nBut now I want to ask Nestor about a different matter,\nsince his knowledge of justice and wisdom is unsurpassed—\nthree times, they say, he’s ruled a generation of men,\nand to me he has the appearance of an immortal!\nSo, Nestor, son of Neleus, tell me this in all honesty:\nhow did Atreus’ son die, wide-ruling Agamemnon?\nAnd where was Menelaos? What death for the king did sly\nAigisthos contrive, since it was a far better man he killed?\nWas he, Menelaos, not there in Achaian Argos, but roaming\nabroad, so that Aigisthos could nerve himself for murder?”\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, responded to him, saying:\n“Very well then, my child: I shall tell you the whole truth.\nYou yourself are clear how all this would have turned out\nhad Atreus’ son, fair-haired Menelaos, discovered,\non his return from Troy, Aigisthos alive in his halls!\nNot even on his corpse then would the earth have been piled,\nbut the dogs and the birds of prey would have devoured him\nas he lay on the plain, far outside the city, nor would any\nAchaian women have mourned him, so vile the deed he wrought.\nWhile we were bivouacked out there, campaigning long and hard,\nhe, at his ease in a corner of horse-grazing Argos,\nwas making seductive proposals to Agamemnon’s wife.\nNow she indeed to begin with rejected the shameful act,\ndid the noble Klytaimnestra, since hers was a virtuous heart;\nand with her she had a minstrel, whom Atreus’ son had ordered,\nbefore leaving for Troy, to be her strict bodyguard.\nBut when divine destiny ensnared her for destruction,\nthen it was that Aigisthos marooned the minstrel, left him\non a desert island, a tasty morsel for birds of prey.\nHer then he took back—both willing—to his own home.\nMany thigh pieces he burned on the gods’ hallowed altars,\nand hung up numerous offerings, both woven and golden,\nafter bringing off the vile action he never hoped to achieve.\n“We were sailing together on our way back from Troy,\nAtreus’ son and myself, close friends with one another;\nbut when we reached sacred Sounion, the headland of Athens,\nthere it was that Phoibos Apollo slew Menelaos’ steersman,\nassailing him with his painless shafts while in his hands\nhe still held the steering oar of the speeding vessel—\nPhrontis, the son of Onetor, who excelled all tribes of mankind\nat steering a ship when gale-force winds were blowing.\nSo Menelaos put in there, though impatient to be sailing,\nto bury his comrade, perform the proper rites over him.\nBut when he too in his voyage over the wine-dark deep\nin his hollow ships arrived off the sheer heights of Malea,\nrunning swiftly, then far-seeing Zeus devised a way to make\nhis voyage disastrous: poured blasts of shrill winds on him,\nswelled the waves to vast size, till they resembled mountains.\nThen he split the flotilla in two, directed some ships to Krete,\nto where the Kydonians dwelt around Iardanos’ streams.\nThere’s a certain steep headland, juts sheer out into the sea,\nat the frontier of Gortyn, in the mist-shrouded deep,\nwhere southwest gales drive great waves against the headland’s\nleft side, toward Phaistos, and low rocks hold back the waves’\nviolence. Here some ships came, their crewmen barely\nescaping disaster: the ships themselves were smashed\nto pieces upon the reef. But the five other dark-prowed vessels\nwere carried away by wind and wave to Egypt.\nSo Menelaos spent time there amassing goods and gold,\ngoing to and fro in his ships among men of alien speech.\nMeanwhile Aigisthos back home enacted his grim plot:\nhe killed Atreus’ son, had the people as his subjects.\nSeven years he reigned as king over golden Mykenai\nbut in the eighth evil came for him—the noble Orestes,\nback home from Athens, who slew his father’s slayer,\nthe crafty Aigisthos, who’d murdered his famous father.\nAfter he’d killed him, he held a funeral feast for the Argives\nover his hateful mother and the cowardly Aigisthos,\nand that same day there arrived Menelaos of the great war cry,\nwith treasure galore, as much freight as his ships could carry.\n“So you too, friend, should not wander over-far from home,\nleaving your wealth behind you, as well as men in your house\nof such arrogance, lest they share and devour your goods,\nmaking your journey here a mere fool’s errand! But now\nthe man I insist on your visiting is Menelaos, for he\nhas lately returned from abroad, got himself back home\nfrom a people that no one would ever hope in his heart\nto return from, once great storms had driven him off course\ninto a sea so vast that migrant birds take an entire\nyear to travel back from it, so vast and fearsome it is!\nSo be off with you now, you, your ship, and your comrades—\nor go overland if you’d rather: here are chariot and horses,\nand here, too, are my sons, who’ll accompany you as guides\nto lordly Lakedaimon, home to fair-haired Menelaos.\nAppeal to him in person, to tell you the whole truth:\nHe won’t tell you lies, he’s far too sagacious.” So\nhe spoke, and the sun went down, and darkness came on.\nAmong them there then spoke the goddess, grey-eyed Athene:\n“Old sir, all this that you’ve told us was properly conveyed.\nBut come now, cut up the ox tongues, and mix the wine,\nso that after libations to Poseidon and the other immortals\nwe may turn our minds to sleep: that time has arrived.\nLight’s passed under darkness already, and it’s not fitting\nto sit late at a feast of the gods: best to be on one’s way.”\nSo spoke the daughter of Zeus, and they paid attention to her.\nHeralds now poured out water over their hands,\nwhile young men topped up the mixing bowls with wine\nand served it to them all, with drops first in each cup.\nThe tongues they threw in the fire, then stood, and poured\nlibations on them. This done, when they’d drunk as much\nas they felt like, then both Athene and godlike Telemachos\nwere eager to be on their way to the hollow ship;\nbut Nestor spoke persuasively, anxious to keep them there:\n“Zeus forbid, and all the other immortal gods,\nthat you should go back from my house to your hollow ship\nas though from some indigent wretch with no spare bedclothes,\nno coverlets in his home, no abundance of blankets\non which both he and his guests could sleep in comfort!\nHere in my house are coverlets and the finest blankets,\nand never shall the dear son of that fine man Odysseus\nbed down on a ship’s afterdeck as long as I’m alive,\nand sons survive after me, are left here in my halls\nto look after whatever guest-friend may come visiting.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“This was well said, old friend! And it’s right that Telemachos\nshould listen to you, since that is by far the better way.\nSo he’ll stay with you tonight, sleep on a bed in your house;\nbut I shall take myself off to our black ship,\ncheer our companions, tell them all the news.\nFor I think I’m the only older person among them:\nthe rest are younger men, who came with him as friends,\nall about the same age as great-hearted Telemachos.\nIt’s there I shall lie tonight, by the hollow black ship;\nthen tomorrow morning I’ll be off to the great-hearted\nKaukonians, where there’s a debt owed to me, neither recent\nnor small. But you send this young man, your visiting guest,\non his way in a chariot, along with your son, and give him\nhorses as well, your lightest runners, your best for strength.”\nSo saying, the grey-eyed goddess Athene went on her way\nin the likeness of a sea eagle: all who saw it were astounded,\nincluding old Nestor, who marveled at what his eyes beheld,\nand he clasped Telemachos’ hand, and said to him: “Friend,\nI hardly think you’ll turn out a mean fellow or a coward\nif indeed when you’re so young the gods act as your escorts!\nFor this was none other of those whose homes are on Olympos\nthan Zeus’ own true-born daughter, maiden most glorious, who\nlikewise honored your noble father among the Argives!\nBe gracious to me, my queen, grant me high renown\nfor myself, for my sons, and for my revered bedfellow,\nand to you in return I’ll sacrifice a yearling heifer, broad-browed,\nstill unbroken, that no man has yet led under the yoke:\nthat’s the one I shall sacrifice, and gild her horns with gold.”\nSo he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him.\nNow Nestor, Gerenian horseman, led them, with his sons\nand his daughters’ husbands, to his splendid domain,\nand when they reached the renowned domain of the king,\nthey sat down there in order on the chairs and benches.\nWhen all of them were settled, the old man mixed them a bowl\nof delicious wine, which was in its eleventh year\nwhen the housekeeper broke its seal and opened the jar.\nThis wine the old man mixed, with many prayers, as he poured\nlibations to Athene, daughter of Zeus of the aegis.\nWhen they’d poured libations, and drunk all they’d a mind to,\nthey went to lie down and sleep, each one in his own dwelling.\nBut Nestor, Gerenian horseman, kept Telemachos, the dear son\nof godlike Odysseus, to sleep there, settling him down\non a corded bedstead out in the echoing portico,\nand with him Peisistratos, of the good ash spear, a leader\nof men, a still unmarried son of his in the halls,\nwhile he himself took his repose in the high house’s inmost room,\nand beside him his lady wife now shared their bed and marriage.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, rose from his bed, went out,\nand sat himself down on one of the polished stone blocks\nthat stood outside his high entrance doors, bright white\nwith a gleam as of oil. This was the place where in time past\nNeleus would sit, a counselor as prestigious as any god;\nbut he’d long since succumbed to fate, gone down to Hades,\nand now Gerenian Nestor, the Achaians’ guardian, sat there,\nscepter in hand, and around him a crowd of his sons gathered,\ncoming out from their bedrooms: Echephron, Stratios,\nPerseus, Aretos, and—a match for a god—Thrasymedes;\nthen, sixth after these, the hero Peisistratos followed,\nbeside whom they brought in and seated godlike Telemachos.\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, was the first to speak among them:\n“Quickly now, my dear children, help realize my desire—\nthat very first of all deities I may propitiate Athene,\nwho came, clearly manifest, to our rich feast for the god!\nSo let one man go to the plain for a heifer, making sure\nthat it comes here right away, with its cowherd driving it;\nand another to the black ship of great-hearted Telemachos,\nto fetch all his comrades, leaving there two men only;\nand another again to send here the goldsmith Laerkes,\nto overlay the horns of the heifer with gold. You others\nare all to stay here, and issue instructions to my servants\nthat they should make ready a feast in my far-famed halls,\nand bring in more chairs and firewood and clear bright water.”\nSo he spoke, and they all bustled busily. The heifer arrived\nfrom the plain, and, from their swift trim vessel, great-hearted\nTelemachos’ comrades showed up. The smith came too\nbringing his bronze tools, the essentials of his trade:\nanvil and hammer and finely fashioned tongs\nwith which he worked the gold. Athene likewise came\nto be there at the sacrifice. Then Nestor, old chariot driver,\ngave the smith gold: he prepared it, overlaid the heifer’s horns,\nthat the goddess might rejoice at the sight of her offering.\nBy its horns Stratios and noble Echephron led in the heifer,\nand Aretos, bringing out water in a flower-decked basin,\ncame from the inner chamber, in his other hand a basket\nof barley-grain; Thrasymedes, that doughty fighter, stood by,\na sharp axe in his hand with which to fell the heifer,\nwhile Perseus readied the blood bowl. Nestor, old chariot driver,\nbegan with the lustral water and sprinkling of barley, offered\nlong prayers to Athene, threw the victim’s cut hairs in the fire.\nWhen they’d prayed, and scattered the barley grains, then at once\nNestor’s son, high-spirited Thrasymedes, stepped\nforward and struck. His axe sheared through the neck’s tendons,\nundid the strength of the heifer. The women keened:\nthe daughters, the sons’ wives, Nestor’s revered\nbedfellow Eurydike, the eldest of Klymenos’ daughters.\nThe men now raised the victim from the wide-wayed earth\nand held it; Peisistratos, leader of men, cut its throat.\nWhen the black blood had flowed from it, and life had left its bones,\nat once they dismembered it, chopped out the thigh pieces\nall in due order, then covered them with a layer of fat\nfolded double, laid raw bits of meat upon them. Then\nthe old man roasted them over split billets, drizzled with bright\nwine, and young men beside him held their five-pronged forks.\nWhen the thighs were properly barbecued, and they’d had a taste\nof the innards, they cut up the rest and roasted it on spits\nuntil it was done through, held the pointed spits in their hands.\nTelemachos meanwhile was bathed by beautiful Polykaste,\nthe youngest daughter of Nestor, Neleus’ son; and after\nshe’d bathed him, and massaged him generously with oil,\nand dressed him in a fine mantle and tunic, he came forth\nfrom the bathtub in appearance like the immortals, and went\nand seated himself by Nestor, the shepherd of his people.\nWhen the outer flesh was well roasted they drew it off the spits,\nand sat down and feasted; good fellows waited on them,\npouring the wine out for them into golden goblets.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, was the first to speak among them:\n“Come, my sons, harness up our fine-maned horses to\nthe chariot for Telemachos, so he can start his journey.”\nSo he spoke, and they hearkened promptly, and obeyed him:\nat once to the chariot they harnessed the swift horses,\nand the housekeeper put in the chariot bread and wine\nand cooked meat, such as princes, Zeus’ nurslings, feed upon.\nThen Telemachos climbed aboard the elegant chariot,\nAnd Nestor’s son Peisistratos, leader of men,\nmounted beside him, took the reins in his hands, and used\nthe whip to start the pair: they, nothing loath, sped off\nonto the plain, abandoning Pylos’ steep citadel,\nand all day shook the yoke that spanned their shoulders.\nThen the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow,\nand they came to Pherai, to the dwelling of Diokles\nthe son of Ortilochos, whom Alpheios sired as his offspring,\nand spent the night there; he treated them as guest-friends.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthey yoked the horses, boarded the inlaid chariot,\ndrove out from the courtyard and echoing portico, used\nthe whip to start the pair: they, nothing loath, sped off,\nand came to the wheat-bearing plain. From there they pursued\ntheir journey at speed, so well did their swift horses bear them.\nThen the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow.\n",

         "\nNow they came to deep-hollowed Lakedaimon with its ravines\nand drove till they reached the domain of far-famed Menelaos.\nHim they found holding a wedding feast with his many kinsmen\nfor a son and an elegant daughter, there in his own dwelling:\nher he was sending out to Achilles’ son, the rank-breaker,\nfor in Troy’s country he first had pledged his word that he’d\ngive her to him, and now the gods were fulfilling the match.\nWith horses and chariots she was soon to travel\nto the Myrmidons’ famed city, where her spouse was king;\nwhile he was bringing from Sparta Alektor’s daughter,\nto wed his favorite son, the doughty Megapenthes,\nborn of a slave girl: to Helen the gods granted no more\nissue after her first child, the lovely Hermione,\nwho had all the beauty of golden Aphrodite. So they\nwere feasting there in the spacious high-roofed hall—\nthe neighbors and kinsmen of far-famed Menelaos,\nat ease, while among them a godlike minstrel was singing\nand playing the lyre, while two tumblers circled\nabout in the thick of them, leading off the dance.\nThe two out at the gateway, themselves and their horses—\nthe hero Telemachos and Nestor’s splendid son—\npulled up short, were seen by the lord Eteoneus as he\ncame out: he, the deft squire of far-famed Menelaos.\nBack through the hall he went to tell the people’s shepherd,\napproached him, and standing close uttered these winged words:\n“Menelaos, Zeus’ nursling, there are two strangers here—\ntwo men who look very much like the offspring of great Zeus!\nTell me, shall we unharness their speedy horses,\nor send them on somewhere else for their entertainment?”\nMuch annoyed, fair-haired Menelaos made him this answer:\n‘You used not to be a fool, Eteoneus, Boethoos’ son,\nhitherto: but now you’re babbling nonsense like a child!\nWe two ate well and often as the guests of other men,\ngenerous hosts, on our way home, hoping only that Zeus\nmight rid us of sorrows hereafter. So go, unyoke the horses\nof these our guests, bring the guests themselves to the feast!”\nSo he spoke. Eteoneus ran through the hall, calling out\nto his busy fellow attendants to follow along with him.\nThey unharnessed the sweating horses from the yoke pole\nand tethered them by their reins at the mangers for horses,\nscattering fodder for them, emmer mixed with white barley.\nThen they left the chariot resting against the white entrance walls\nand led their guests into the godlike domain. What they saw\namazed them, passing through the abode of this king who was\nZeus’ nursling: a brightness like that of the sun or moon\nlit up the high-roofed dwelling of far-famed Menelaos.\nAnd when they’d feasted their eyes on this spectacle, they stepped\ninto polished bathtubs and were bathed. Then, after\nmaidservants had washed them, massaged them with oil,\nand clothed them in tunics and woolen mantles, they\nsat down on high chairs next to Atreus’ son Menelaos.\nA handmaid fetched and poured them water from a pitcher—\nexquisite, golden—over a silver basin, for them\nto wash their hands, and placed a polished table nearby,\nwhile the dignified housekeeper brought bread, set it before them,\nwith various side dishes, giving freely of her provisions,\nand the carver loaded and brought to them platters of meat\nof every kind, and put golden goblets before them.\nThen fair-haired Menelaos welcomed them in these words:\n“Fall to, and enjoy yourselves! Afterwards, when you’ve eaten\nyour dinner, then we’ll question you as to who you may be\namong men, for in you two the ancestry’s not obscure—\nyour mortal bloodline’s that of those sceptered princes,\nZeus’ own nurslings: no commoner could have sired such sons.”\nWith that he picked up and set before them the fat beef chine,\nwell roasted, that he himself had received as an honor. Then they\nreached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nthen it was that Telemachos spoke to the son of Nestor,\nhead leaning close to him, so that others might not hear:\n“Just look, son of Nestor, friend dear to my heart, at all\nthe bright shine of bronze throughout these echoing halls,\nthe gleam of gold and amber, of silver and ivory!\nThe court of Olympian Zeus must be like this inside,\nthere’s such limitless wealth here: I’m awed by the sight of it!”\nAs he spoke, fair-haired Menelaos picked up what he said,\nand addressed them both as follows, in winged words:\n“Dear children, with Zeus no mortal might ever contend,\nfor eternal are his residences and his possessions;\nbut of men I might have a rival, or again I might not,\nin possessions! True, after I’d suffered much, wandered far,\nI came back home in the eighth year, bringing my wealth\nin my ships, having visited Cyprus, Phoenicia, Egypt,\nthe Aithiopes, the Sidonians, and the Eremboi,\nand Libya, where the lambkins grow horns almost from birth,\nand the ewes give birth three times within a single year,\nso that neither master nor shepherd ever goes without\ncheese or mutton or sweet milk, but their flocks\nare ready for milking the whole year through. But while\nI was busy amassing a sizable livelihood as I roamed\nfrom country to country, another man killed my brother—\nsecretly, caught him off guard, through the guile of his damned wife!\nSo it gives me no pleasure to be lord of these possessions.\nBesides, you’ll have heard all this from your fathers, whoever\nthey are, since I suffered greatly, losing a well-established\nhousehold, that contained many rare possessions! If only\nI could live in this house of mine with no more than a third\npart of those goods, and that all the men were alive still\nwho died in broad Troy, far away from horse-grazing Argos!\nYet though I so often weep and lament for them all\nas I sit here in my home—at times I indulge my heart\nby mourning, but then again I’ll stop, for all too soon\none reaches one’s surfeit of sorrow—nevertheless,\ndespite my grief, I don’t mourn so much for them all\nas for that one, who makes me abhor both sleep and food\nwhen I recall him: no other Achaian suffered such hardship\nor achieved as much as Odysseus, though for himself\nwhat was destined was trouble, and for me unforgettable\nendless grief over him: he’s been gone so long, we can’t tell\nif he’s living or dead! They must be mourning him now—\nold Laertes, prudent Penelope, and Telemachos, still\na newborn child in the house at the time he left”—in whom,\nso speaking, he stirred the urge to mourn his father. Tears\ndropped from Telemachos’ eyelids as he heard his father’s name,\nand with both hands he held his purple mantle up\nin front of his eyes. Menelaos took note of what he did,\nand turned over in his mind and in his heart the thought:\nshould he let the boy mention his father first himself,\nor rather question him first, examine him on each matter?\nWhile he was debating thus, in his mind and heart,\nHelen came in, from her fragrant high-roofed boudoir,\nlike Artemis of the golden distaff, and with her Adreste,\nwho brought out for her a finely made recliner,\nwhile Alkippe fetched her a rug of the softest wool,\nand Phylo a silver basket given her as a present\nby Alkandre, the wife of Polybos, who dwelt in Egyptian\nThebe, where the richest goods adorn all private homes:\nhe made Menelaos a present of two silver bathtubs,\na pair of tripods, and ten talents of gold. In addition\nhis wife presented Helen with magnificent gifts:\na golden distaff she gave her, and a work basket on wheels,\nfashioned of silver, its rims all finished off with gold.\nIt was this that her handmaid Phylo brought in and placed\nbeside her, full of yarn already spun, and across it\nwas laid the distaff, loaded with darkly violet wool.\nHelen sat down in the recliner, a footstool under her feet,\nand at once let fly at her husband a row of questions:\n“Menelaos, nursling of Zeus, do we know who these men\nare, or say they are, who’ve come to our house? Shall I\nkeep quiet or say what I think? Oh, I simply must tell you!\nNot once did I ever see such a striking resemblance,\nin either a man or a woman—it truly astounds me!\nThis boy could be the son of great-hearted Odysseus,\nTelemachos, left as a newborn child in the house\nby him, when because of me, the bitch, you Achaians\nwent out against Troy, hearts set on ruthless warfare.”\nThen fair-haired Menelaos responded to her, saying:\n“I too see the likeness now, wife, exactly as you perceive it:\nsuch as this boy’s were Odysseus’ feet and hands,\nand the way he’d glance, and his head, and the hair above it!\nAnd when, just now, I was reminiscing about Odysseus,\nrecounting all the sorrows and hardships that he endured\non my behalf, the boy shed bitter tears from under\nhis eyelids, held up that purple mantle before his eyes.”\nTo him Peisistratos, Nestor’s son, now responded, saying:\n“Atreus’ son Menelaos, Zeus’ nursling, leader of troops,\nthis youth is indeed his son, exactly as you tell it!\nBut he’s also modest, and personally embarrassed\nby the thought of being too outspoken in what he says\nbefore you, whose voice delights us both like a god’s.\nAs for me, the Gerenian horseman Nestor sent me\nto be Telemachos’ escort, since he was eager to see you,\nand hoped you’d give him some encouraging word or action;\nfor many troubles a son encounters at home when his father’s\nlong absent, when he’s got no other supporters, as now\nit is with Telemachos: his father’s away, nor are there\nany others among his people who’d stave off trouble from him.”\nThen fair-haired Menelaos responded to him, saying:\n“Wonder of wonders! There’s come to my house the son\nof a man who’s my dear friend, who faced much hardship\non my account: when he came home, I figured I’d welcome him\nmore than all other Argives—if we two ever got back over\nthe sea in our swift ships, thanks to far-seeing Olympian Zeus!\nI’d have made some Argive town his, built a house there for him,\nfetched from Ithake his son, his possessions, all his people—\nexpelling the population of one of those cities located\nround about, those that acknowledge me as their ruler.\nBoth living here, we’d have seen a lot of each other: nothing\nwould have kept us apart, away from friendship’s pleasures,\nuntil the black cloud of death in the end enfolded us!\nBut the god himself, I suppose, resented such a prospect,\nand denied a safe homecoming to that unlucky man alone.”\nSo he spoke, and stirred in them all an urge to lamentation:\nArgive Helen, daughter of Zeus, shed tears now,\nand Telemachos wept, as did Atreus’ son Menelaos,\nnor could the son of Nestor keep his eyes tearless, as he\nrecalled in his heart the peerless Antilochos,\nslain by the bright Dawn’s glorious son. So now,\nthinking of him, he uttered winged words, saying:\n“Son of Atreus, old Nestor would always refer to you as\nthe most sagacious of men, when your name came up\nin his halls, when questions arose between us: so now,\nif it’s possible, do me a favor! I’m not the sort of man\nto hold sad discussions at dinner: next morning’s soon enough\nfor that kind of thing. Of course, I’m not against\ngrieving for any mortal who’s died and met his fate:\nthis is the only due we pay to wretched mortals,\nto crop our hair, and let the tears course down our cheeks!\nFor a brother of mine, too, is dead, one far from the meanest\nof Argives—you may well have known him, though I myself\nnever met nor saw him: still, they say that Antilochos\nexcelled all others both as a runner and as a fighter.”\nThen fair-haired Menelaos responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, what you’ve said is all that any sagacious man\ncould say or do, even one who was older than you are!\nSuch a father is yours, as your careful speech makes clear.\nEasily known is the offspring of that man for whom\nKronos’ son spins good fortune in his marriage and his children,\nas now he has granted Nestor, through all his days,\nto reach old age at home in prosperity, with his sons\nproving themselves both sharp-witted and expert spearmen.\nSo we’ll leave off the weeping that recently took place,\nand let’s turn our minds back to dinner—let them pour water\nover our hands! Time enough tomorrow morning\nfor me and Telemachos to have a full discussion.”\nSo he spoke, and Asphalion poured water on their hands—\nAsphalion, busy squire of renowned Menelaos. They now\nreached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nThen Helen, daughter of Zeus, had another idea: at once\ninto the wine they were drinking she added a drug\nthat banishes grief and anger, brings oblivion of all ills:\nwhoever swallowed it when mixed into the bowl\nwould not, for the rest of that day, wet his cheeks with tears,\neven though his mother and father should lie there dead,\nor a brother or dear son should be killed in his presence,\ncut down by the sword, and his own eyes witnessed it—\nso powerful were the drugs that this daughter of Zeus possessed,\nbenign ones, a present from Thon’s wife Polydamna,\na native of Egypt; for there the grain-giving earth bears most\ndrugs—many healing in mixture, and many malignant:\neach man there’s a physician, more knowledgeable than all\nmankind elsewhere, for indeed they are of Paieon’s race.\nSo when she’d added the drug and had the wine poured out,\nat once she spoke again, and responded to them, saying:\n“Atreus’ son Menelaos, Zeus’ nursling, and you other sons\nof excellent sires! Now to one man, now to another\nthe god, Zeus, gives good or ill, for he can do anything; so\nfeast on, sitting here in our halls at your ease, and enjoy\nlistening to tales: I’ll tell one that fits this occasion well!\nI can’t rehearse or enumerate all the many trials\nof steadfast-minded Odysseus, but there is this one exploit,\nperformed and endured by the mighty warrior in\nthe Trojans’ land, where you Achaians endured troubles!\nHe scourged his own person with harsh unseemly blows,\nflung rags about his shoulders to look like a menial,\nand slipped into the enemy’s wide-wayed city,\nconcealing himself in the likeness of another, a beggar,\nquite different from the real man at the Achaians’ ships.\nThus disguised he entered the Trojans’ city, unrecognized\nby them all: I alone perceived who he really was,\nand questioned him; he in his cunning dodged my enquiries.\nBut after I’d bathed him and rubbed him down with oil,\nand put good clothes on him, and swore a mighty oath\nnot to reveal him as Odysseus among the Trojans\nuntil he was safely back to the swift ships and the huts,\nthen at last he told me all the plans of the Achaians;\nand—after he’d killed many Trojans with the keen-edged bronze—\ngot back to the Argives, brought them much information.\nThe other Trojan women wailed in grief, but my own\nspirit rejoiced, since already my heart was set to return\nback home, and I groaned for the blindness that Aphrodite\nhad inflicted in leading me there, away from my dear country,\nabandoning my own child, my bedchamber, my husband—\nwho was lacking in nothing, either brains or looks.”\nThen fair-haired Menelaos responded to her, saying:\n“All this indeed, my wife, you have stated correctly.\nLong since have I come to know the minds and counsel\nof many heroic men, and have traveled widely,\nbut never yet have I met and studied such a person\nas steadfast Odysseus was at heart; nor have I known\nso striking a deed as that great man devised and achieved\nin the carpentered Horse, where we—all the very best\nof the Argives—sat, bringing death and destiny\nto the Trojans. You came then—maybe impelled\nby a god determined to grant the Trojans some glory—\nand godlike Deiphobos along with you. Three times\nyou circled the hollow ambush, tapping its surface,\ncalling out to all the Danaan leaders by name,\nimitating the voice of each of the Argives’ wives.\nNow I and the son of Tydeus, with noble Odysseus,\nwere sitting inside, and could hear the way you were calling.\nDiomedes and I were both eager to jump from our seats\nand emerge, or at least to answer you from inside;\nbut Odysseus, despite our longing, held us back in place.\nThen all the Achaians’ sons kept silent except for\nAntiklos, who was still determined to answer you,\nhad not Odysseus kept his mouth firmly shut\nwith his great powerful hands, and saved all us Achaians\nby holding firm until Pallas Athene led you from us.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Atreus’ son Menelaos, Zeus’ nursling, leader of troops,\nso much the worse, for this didn’t ward off grim destruction\nfrom him, nor would have done, had his heart within been of iron!\nSo come now, dispatch us to bed, so that we without delay\nmay settle down and enjoy the pleasures of sweet sleep.”\nSo he spoke, and Argive Helen gave orders to her handmaids\nto set bedsteads under the colonnade, and lay upon them\nfine purple wool throws, and over these to spread blankets,\ntopped off with fleecy mantles that would serve as coverlets.\nOut from the hall went the handmaids, each holding a torch,\nand made up the beds. A herald escorted the guests.\nThey then lay down to sleep there, in the dwelling’s forecourt,\nthe hero Telemachos and Nestor’s splendid son;\nbut Atreus’ son slept in a back room of the high house,\nand by him lay long-robed Helen, resplendent among women.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nMenelaos of the great war cry rose from the bed he’d slept in,\nput on his clothes, slung a sharp sword from one shoulder,\ntied on a pair of sandals under his sleek feet,\nsallied forth from his chamber, in appearance like a god,\nsat down beside Telemachos, and addressed him as follows:\n‘What need was it brought you here, heroic Telemachos,\nto sunny Lakedaimon, over the broad back of the sea?\nSomething public, or personal? Tell me the truth of this.”\nSagacious Telemachos answered him: “Atreus’ son,\nMenelaos, Zeus’ nursling, leader of troops, I came\nin the hope you might be able to tell me news of my father.\nMy estate is being eaten up and my rich farms ruined,\nmy house is crowded with foes who continue to slaughter\nmy flocks of sheep and my crumple-horned shambling cattle—\nthese arrogant, overweening suitors of my mother!\nThat’s why I’m here at your knees now—you might be willing\nto tell me about his grim death, if you maybe saw it\nyourself, or heard an account of it from some other\nwanderer: to unmatched misery his mother bore him!\nAnd don’t, from concern or pity, speak false comfort to me,\nbut tell me exactly whatever you may have witnessed!\nI beseech you, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, made you\nany promise, by word or action, and delivered on it\nin the land of the Trojans, where you Achaians met grief,\nremember it now, and tell me the unerring truth of it.”\nDeeply troubled, fair-haired Menelaos now addressed him:\n“I tell you, it was indeed in the bed of a brave warrior\nthat these fellows, cowards themselves, hoped they might lie!\nAs when in a thicket, the lair of a powerful lion,\na doe has laid to sleep her newborn suckling fawns,\nand goes off, traversing foothills and grassy glens\nin search of pasture, and the lion returns to his den\nand on both her fawns unleashes a ghastly fate—just so\nwill Odysseus unleash a ghastly fate on these men!\nHow I wish—by Zeus the Father and Athene and Apollo!—\nthat he, as strong as he was that time in well-built Lesbos\nwhen he stood up and wrestled a bout with Philomeleides,\nand threw him down forcefully, and all the Achaians cheered,\nmight come—he, Odysseus—in such strength among these suitors!\nThen they’d all get a swift end and a bitter marriage!\nAs regards the business you’re enquiring about, I shan’t\nveer off onto other subjects, nor will I mislead you—\nof all that I heard from the forthright Old Man of the Sea\nnot one word will I keep back or conceal from you!\n“Though I longed to return here, the gods still held me back\nin Egypt, since I’d not offered them adequate sacrifices—\ngods always want mortals to bear their behests in mind!\nWell, there exists an island set in the surging sea,\noffshore from Egypt: Pharos, they call it, as far out\nas a hollow ship can cover in one whole day\nwith a tailwind strong and constant blowing behind it;\nthere’s a harbor there with good anchorage, where men\ntake on water before sailing out in their trim ships.\nThere for twenty days the gods stayed me, nor ever did\nthose maritime tailwinds show up that escort ships\nsafely across the sea’s broad back; so all my stores\nwould have been eaten up, and my crew’s strength with them,\nhad not one of the gods shown compassion and rescued me—\nthe daughter of mighty Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea,\nEidothee: it was her heart I’d stirred in particular when\nshe encountered me straying alone, far away from my comrades,\nwho’d gone out round the island, engaged in fishing\nwith bent hooks, since starvation was crimping their bellies.\nShe it was who approached now, and addressed me, saying:\n‘Are you just childish, stranger, excessively dim-witted,\nor deliberately acting the fool, out of pleasure in suffering?\nThe way you’re stuck on this island, unable to discover\nany way out, and your men near to despairing!’\n“So she spoke; and I then responded to her, saying:\n‘Let me tell you—whichever goddess it is that you are—\nthat no way am I stuck here by choice: it must be that\nI’ve trespassed against the immortals who hold wide heaven!\nSo tell me—for you gods have knowledge of everything—\nwhich immortal is keeping me here, holding up my journey,\nand how I’m to get back home, across the fish-rich sea.’\n“So I spoke, and at once she, bright among goddesses, said:\n‘Well, stranger, I’ll give you a full and accurate answer.\nThere’s a certain Old Man of the Sea—he often comes here—\nimmortal and truthful—Proteus of Egypt, who knows\nthe depths of every sea, a servant of Poseidon:\nthey say he’s my father, that he begot me. Now if\nyou could somehow lie in wait and get hold of him, then\nhe could tell you about your return, the details of your journey,\nall your long voyage homeward across the fish-rich sea.\nWhat’s more, Zeus’ nursling, if you wanted, he could relate\nwhat’s been done in your halls, for both good and evil,\nwhile you were away on your long and arduous journey.’\n“So she spoke, and I then made answer to her, saying:\n‘Show me yourself now how to ambush this old immortal—\nhe might see me beforehand, be alerted, avoid me:\nit’s hard for a mere mortal to overpower a god.’\n“So I spoke, and at once she, bright among goddesses, said:\n‘Well, stranger, I’ll give you a full and accurate answer.\nAt the time that the sun has risen to span mid-heaven\nthis truthful Old Man of the Sea emerges from the waves\nwith the breath of the west wind, concealed by a dark ripple.\nWhen he’s out, he lies down to sleep in the hollow caves,\nand around him the seals, the sweet sea daughter’s brood,\ncome up out of the grey sea water, fall asleep together,\nexhaling a pungent reek of the sea’s far-reaching depths.\nI’ll take you there tomorrow as dawn is breaking\nand settle you down in a row—you must carefully choose\nthree of your comrades, the best in your strong-benched ships—\nand tell you about all the tricks of the old man. First,\nhe’ll count the number of seals, go over them all;\nbut when he’s totted them up and reviewed them, then\nhe’ll bed down in the midst of them, like a shepherd among his flock.\nNow as soon as you see him settled, then will be the time\nto muster up every last drop of your strength and vigor,\nand hold him firm, though he’ll struggle mightily to escape.\nHe’ll test you by turning into every creature that comes forth\nand moves on the earth, into water, into devouring fire;\nyet keep him pinned down, hold on to him all the harder!\nBut when at last he questions you in his own person,\nin that shape he had when you watched him settling down,\nthen, hero, cease your violence, set the old man free,\nask him which of the gods it is that’s angry with you\nand your homecoming, how you’re to traverse the fish-rich sea.’\n“That said, she dived down into the surging deep,\nand I returned to my ships, drawn up on the beach,\nmy heart brooding darkly on many things as I went.\nThen, after we’d gone on down to our ship and the sea,\nand made ready our meal, and ambrosial night came on,\nwe lay down to sleep there, beside the breaking surf.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthen indeed along the strand of the broad-wayed sea\nI went, praying much to the gods, and taking with me\nthe three comrades I most trusted for every venture.\n“She meanwhile had plunged down into the sea’s broad gulf\nand fetched up from the deep the skins of four seals, all\nrecently flayed: she’d thought up a trick against her father.\nShe dug out hollow forms in the sandy beach, and sat there,\nwaiting. So we came right up to her, and she made us\nlie down in a row, threw a skin over each of us. Now\nour ambush would have been torture, for most horribly\ndid the vile stench of these brine-bred seals revolt us—\nwho’d choose to bed down beside a beast from the sea?—\nhad she herself not rescued us, devised a great remedy:\nshe brought and positioned ambrosia under each man’s nose,\nthat breathed sweet fragrance, destroying the sea beast’s stink.\nSo all that morning we waited, with enduring patience,\ntill the seals came crowding up from the water and then\nsettled themselves in lines along the seashore. At noon\nthe old man emerged from the sea, to find his well-nourished\nseals: he inspected them all and checked their number,\ncounting us first among the beasts, never once suspecting\nthe trick we’d played. Then he too lay down to rest.\nSo we with a shout sprang on him, locked him in our arms;\nBut the old man hadn’t forgotten his own elusive arts,\nfar from it: first he became a bearded lion,\nthen a serpent, then a leopard, then a gigantic boar;\nthen he turned into flowing water, and a tall leafy tree;\nbut with resolute heart we kept him firmly pinned down,\nand when the cunning old trickster was at last exhausted\nthen he finally spoke and questioned me, saying: ‘Which\nof the gods, son of Atreus, was it advised you how to ambush\nand catch me against my will? What is it that you want?’\n“So he spoke, and I then made answer to him, saying:\n‘You yourself know, old man—why try to trick me with\nthis question?—how long I’ve been stuck here on this island,\nunable to find a way out, my inner spirit fading: so you\ntell me—since gods are all-knowing—which immortal\nis it who fetters me here, who’s kept me from my journey—\nand how I’m to get back home across the fish-rich sea.’\n“So I spoke: he at once made answer to me, saying:\n‘You should have made rich sacrifices to Zeus and the other gods\nbefore embarking, to ensure your speedy return\nto your own country, voyaging over the wine-dark deep!\nFor it isn’t your fate to set eyes on your friends, or make it\nback to your well-set home and your ancestral country\nbefore you’ve once more been to the waters of Egypt’s\nheaven-fed river and offered ample sacrifices\nto the immortal gods who hold wide heaven: only\nthen, at last, will they grant you the journey that you desire.’\n“So he spoke; but the heart within me was shattered\nby his sending me back again to traverse the misty deep\nto Egypt, a lengthy and most wearisome journey.\nYet even so I still responded to him, saying:\n‘All this I shall do, old man, exactly as you bid me.\nBut come now, tell me this, give me a true report:\nDid all the Achaians get home with their ships, unharmed,\nall those Nestor and I left when we set out from Troy?\nOr did any die by some unkind fate on shipboard,\nor in their friends’ arms, after winding up the war?’\n“So I spoke: he at once made answer to me, saying:\n‘Son of Atreus, why ask me this? It’s not your business\nto know or search out my mind—nor do I think\nyou’ll long be tearless when you hear the full account!\nFor many of them perished, and many were left there,\nthough only two leaders of the bronze-corseleted Achaians\ndied when returning home, or in the war—you were there then!—\nand one may still be alive, held back out there on the deep.\nAias was done for, along with his long-oared vessels:\nfirst Poseidon drove him onto the massive rocks\nof Gyrai, yet rescued him, brought him safe from the sea;\nand he’d have escaped his fate, though hated by Athene,\nhad he not, infatuate, uttered a reckless boast, asserted\nthat it was in spite of the gods he’d escaped the sea’s\ngreat gulf, so that Poseidon, hearing his noisy bragging,\nat once took hold of the trident in his mighty fists\nand struck the rock face of Gyrai, split a part off.\nThe rock held firm, but the fragment where Aias was perched\nwhen he made his reckless boast crashed into the sea,\nbore him down with it into the boundless surging main,\nso he swallowed his fill of salt water, and thus perished.\n‘But your brother somehow escaped, eluded the death spirits\nwith his hollow ships: it was the lady Here who saved him.\nThen, when he was nearing Malea’s sheer promontory,\na strong gale took hold of him, carried him headlong\nover the fish-rich waters, groaning disconsolately,\nto the coast of that land where in time past Thyestes\nhad his abode, but now his son Aigisthos dwelt there.\nYet from this point too an unharmed return was shown him:\nThe gods changed the gale to a tailwind, and they got home.\nNow he, Agamemnon, rejoicing, set foot on his native soil,\nlaid hold of the earth and kissed it, a flood of warm tears\nstreamed down his face, so glad he was to see his homeland.\n‘But a watch at his lookout saw him, a man brought in\nand set there by crafty Aigisthos, who promised him a reward,\ntwo talents of gold: he’d been keeping watch for a year now\nin case he slipped past unseen, fierce valor not forgotten.\nNow the watchman went to the palace, informed the people’s\nshepherd: Aigisthos at once thought up a crafty scheme:\nhe chose twenty men, the best fighters in the region,\nand placed them in ambush, but across the hall laid on\na feast, then took horses and chariots to welcome Agamemnon,\nthe people’s shepherd, mind set on treacherous action,\nand brought him back, unaware of his coming fate, and after\nfeasting him killed him, the way you’d butcher an ox at its crib.\nNot one of all Atreus’ son’s comrades remained alive there,\nnot one of Aigisthos’ men: they all died in the halls.’\n“So he spoke, and the spirit within me was shattered.\nAnd I wept as I sat on the sand there, my heart no longer\nwanted to live, to behold the sunlight. But after\nI’d had my fill of weeping and groveling, then\nthe forthright Old Man of the Sea addressed me, saying:\n‘No longer, son of Atreus, waste time like this in ceaseless\nweeping: no good will come of it! Rather do all you can\nto get back soon to your country: there’s always a chance\nof finding that man alive still—if Orestes hasn’t arrived first\nand killed him, and you only get there in time for the funeral.’\n“So he spoke, and the heart and proud spirit once again\nwere cheered in my breast, despite the grief I felt,\nand I spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n‘These men I know of. But tell me, who’s the third man,\nthe one who may be alive still, held back out there on the main—\nor is he dead? Though it grieve me, I want to hear the truth.’\n“So I spoke: he at once made answer to me, saying:\n‘That is the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithake:\nhim I saw on an island, shedding copious tears,\nin the home of the nymph Kalypso, who by constraint\ndetains him there, so he can’t get back to his own country,\nfor he has no ships with oars, nor any comrades\nto further his voyage over the broad back of the sea.\nBut it isn’t your destiny, Menelaos, Zeus’ nursling,\nto die and meet your fate in horse-grazing Argos: rather\nit’s to the Elysian plain and the furthest ends of the earth\nthat the immortals will bring you, where fair-haired Rhadamanthys\ndwells, and where the living is easiest for mankind:\nno snow’s there, no strong storms, nor ever any rain,\nbut a constant light western breeze coming up off the ocean\nto provide mankind with cooling relief; for as they see it,\nsince you have Helen as wife, you’re a son-in-law of Zeus.’\n“That said, he plunged down into the surging deep;\nand I returned to the ships with my godlike comrades,\nmy heart brooding darkly on many things as I went.\nThen after we’d gone on down to our ship and the sea,\nand made ready our meal, and ambrosial night came on,\nwe lay down to sleep there, beside the breaking surf.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nour ships first of all we hauled into the bright salt sea,\nand set up the masts and sails in these well-trimmed vessels.\nThen the men went aboard, and sat down on the benches,\nand ranged in close order struck the grey sea with their oars.\nSo back to Egypt, land of the heaven-fed river, I brought\nand moored my vessels, and offered most lavish sacrifices;\nand when I’d appeased the wrath of the gods that are forever\nI raised Agamemnon a grave mound, that his fame might be\nundying. That done, I set sail for home. The immortals\ngave me a tailwind, conveyed me to my own dear land.\nSo come now, stay on with me longer here in my halls,\nfor eleven or twelve more days, and after that\nI’ll arrange you a proper send-off, with some splendid gifts—\nthree horses, a well-polished chariot. In addition\nI’ll give you a beautiful cup: then, when you pour libations\nto the deathless gods, you’ll remember me all your days.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Son of Atreus, please don’t invite me to stay here longer!\nTruth is, I’d be only too happy to sit on for a full year\nin your abode here, home and parents all forgotten,\nso rare is the pleasure I get from listening to your stories\nand the way you tell them! But already my comrades are fretting\nto leave sacred Pylos, you’re keeping me here so long!\nAs for the present you give me, make that a keepsake:\nhorses I’ll not take back to Ithake, but rather leave them\nhere for your pleasure, since you are lord of a spacious\nplain with an abundance of clover and galingale,\nof wheat and millet and ample-grained white barley.\nBut Ithake has no broad courses, nor any meadows; it gives\npasture to goats—more attractive than that for horses!\nNone of the islands has meadows or space for chariots:\neach of them slopes down seaward, Ithake most of all.”\nSo he spoke. Menelaos of the great war cry smiled,\ncaressed him with one hand, and addressed him, saying:\n“The way you talk, dear child, reveals your good breeding!\nI’ll change these presents, then, since I can: of all the gifts\nlaid away in my house as personal treasures I shall\ngive you the one that’s most beautiful and most costly:\na finely wrought mixing bowl, made all of silver throughout,\nrims finished off with a golden inlay, the work\nof Hephaistos, a present from the hero Phaidimos,\nthe Sidonians’ king, at the time that his house gave me shelter\nwhen I’d got that far homeward. This I’d like you to have.”\nSuch were the words they exchanged between one another,\nwhile the banqueters were arriving at the godlike king’s domain:\nthey drove up sheep, they brought beneficent wine,\ntheir fine-veiled wives came with them, carrying bread.\nThus they busied themselves about the feast in the halls.\nMeanwhile the suitors gathered in front of Odysseus’ abode\nwere amusing themselves, in their usual arrogant fashion,\nby throwing the discus and javelin out on a leveled terrace\nwhere Antinoos and godlike Eurymachos were sitting—\nthe suitors’ leaders, by far the best-born among them.\nThey were approached now by Phronios’ son Noemon,\nwho addressed Antinoos, had this question for him:\n“Antinoos, do we or don’t we know for certain when\nTelemachos will get back here from sandy Pylos? He went\ntaking a ship of mine, and now I have need of it\nto go over to widespread Elis, where I’ve a dozen\nbrood mares, now suckling young mules, unbroken, hard\nworkers: I want to drive one off, break it in.”\nSo he spoke. They were quietly astonished, had no idea\nthat Telemachos had gone to Neleian Pylos, believed him\nsomewhere out in the fields, with his flocks or at the swineherd’s.\nAntinoos, Eupeithes’ son, now responded to him, saying:\n“When exactly did he leave? And who were those young men\nthat went with him? Select Ithakans, or just his own\nfield hands and household servants? This too he could have done.\nAnd give me a true answer, I need to be quite certain:\nWas it by force, against your will, that he took your black ship,\nor did you give it him freely because he asked you for it?”\nNoemon, the son of Phronios, responded to him, saying:\n“I gave it him freely myself. What would anyone do\nwhen a man of his sort, with the troubles he has at heart,\nmade the request? To not give it him would be hard.\nAs for the youths, those gone with him are Ithake’s best\nafter ourselves: I noticed their leader embarking and he\nwas Mentor—or else some god who looked just like him.\nIt’s an odd thing: I saw godlike Mentor here yesterday\nat dawn, but in fact he’d left then in the ship to Pylos.”\nThis said, he took himself off to his father’s house,\nleaving the proud hearts of both highly disconcerted. They\nat once made the suitors quit their games and sit down,\nand among them Antinoos, Eupeithes’ son, now spoke,\nbitterly troubled, his black heart brimming over\nwith rage, while his eyes had the semblance of blazing fire.\n“An outrageous act, I swear, most high-handedly brought off,\nthis trip by Telemachos! And we thought he’d never make it!\nDespite all of us here, the brat’s gone, just like that—\ngot a ship, launched it, enrolled the best men we have!\nPretty soon he’ll be trouble for us: so may Zeus\ndestroy his power before he ever comes to full manhood!\nCome then, give me a fast ship and twenty comrades,\nso I can set an ambush, watch for him as he steers\nthrough the narrows between Ithake and sheer beetling Same,\nand give him a miserable voyage in his quest for his father!”\nSo he spoke: they all assented, backed his proposal,\ngot up at once, and went off to the house of Odysseus.\nNor was Penelope left for long without knowledge\nof the schemes that the suitors hatched in secret discussion,\nfor Medon the herald told her, who, outside the courtyard,\nheard the whole plot that they, inside, were weaving,\nand went in through the hall to inform Penelope of it.\nAs he set foot across the threshold Penelope addressed him:\n“Herald, for what have the lordly suitors now dispatched you?\nTo tell the household servants of godlike Odysseus\nto stop their appointed tasks, and cook up a feast for them?\nWould that this, with no prospect of future wooing or meetings\nelsewhere, were to be the last and latest dinner\nof all you who throng here, gobbling up so much livelihood,\nthe possessions of clever Telemachos! Did you not listen\nlong ago, when you were children, to your fathers’ talk\nof what manner of man Odysseus was among your begetters,\nwronging by deed or word no person in the land,\nunlike the custom of most of these godlike monarchs,\nwho hate one man and favor another as they please?\nBut he never ever treated anyone badly, whereas\nyour cast of mind and unseemly actions are all too clearly\nvisible, nor nowadays do past favors reap gratitude.”\nMedon, astute in counsel, then responded to her, saying:\n“My queen, would that this were the worst of all your troubles!\nBut there’s something else, more serious and threatening,\nthat the suitors are planning—Zeus forfend that it come to pass!\nThey intend to cut down Telemachos with the sharp bronze\non his way home—he sailed away, seeking news\nof his father, to sacred Pylos and lordly Lakedaimon.”\nSo he spoke. On the spot her knees and heart gave way,\nand for long she remained speechless. Both her eyes\nbrimmed over with tears, and her vigorous voice was stilled.\nBut at last she framed words again, and addressed him, saying:\n“Herald, why is my child gone? There was no need for him\nto go aboard swift-moving vessels that serve mankind\nas the sea’s horses, crossing wide stretches of the deep!\nIs not even his name to survive among mankind?”\nMedon, astute in counsel, responded to her, saying:\n“I do not know if some god incited him, or it was his own\nspirit stirred him to go to Pylos, to find out about\nhis father’s homecoming, or what fate he’d met.”\nWith that\nhe went on his way, out through Odysseus’ house; but she\nwas sunk in heart-crushing anguish, had no more strength\nto get herself to a chair, of the many in the room, but sank\ndown there, on her richly worked bedchamber’s threshold,\nsobbing piteously, and around her wailed her handmaids,\nall of them, young and old, that were there in the house.\nAfter much crying, Penelope now addressed them, saying:\n“Listen, my friends: on me the Olympian’s laid more grief\nthan any woman brought up with me has suffered! Years ago\nI lost my good husband: a lion’s heart he possessed,\nand stood out among the Danaans for every kind of virtue:\na fine man—wide is his fame through Hellas and mid-Argos!\nAnd now the gales have swept my beloved son away\nwithout trace from our home: I had no word of his going.\nYou cruel wretches, not one of you thought to arouse me\nfrom sleep, though you knew very well what was going on\nat the time that he went aboard that hollow black vessel!\nIf I’d only found out that he was planning this journey\nhe’d either have had to stay here, though longing to be gone,\nor else he’d have left me a corpse, here in my own halls!\nAs it is, will someone go quickly and summon old Dolios,\nmy servant, a gift from my father when first I came here,\nwho tends my orchard of fruit trees. He is to go at once,\nsit down beside Laertes, tell him all that’s happened—\nin the hope that Laertes will come up with some scheme,\npresent himself, lamenting, before these folk who are minded\nto do away with his stock, and that of godlike Odysseus.”\nEurykleia then, cherished nurse, responded to her, saying:\n“Dear girl, whether you finish me with the pitiless bronze\nor let me stay in the house here, I shan’t conceal the truth.\nI indeed knew all this, and gave him all he asked for—\nbread and sweet wine. But he made me swear a great oath\nnot to tell you for twelve days at least—or till you yourself\nmissed him, and heard that he’d gone—so that you would not\nfall to weeping, and spoil your lovely complexion. So now\ngo bathe yourself, and change into laundered clothes,\nand go upstairs to your room, you and your serving women,\nand pray to Athene, daughter of Zeus of the aegis: for she\nmight save him hereafter, even from death. But do not\nfurther burden that burdened old man—I can’t believe\nthat the line of Arkeisios’ son is wholly detested by\nthe blessed gods: there will surely still be an heir to possess\nhis high-roofed abode, his rich and distant fields.”\nSo speaking she lulled her grief, dried the tears from her eyes.\nPenelope went and bathed, changed into clean clothes,\nwent upstairs to her room, she and her serving women,\nput barley grain in a basket, then made her prayer to Athene:\n“Hear me, unwearying one, child of Zeus of the aegis!\nIf ever for you in his halls resourceful Odysseus made\nburnt sacrifice of fat thigh pieces of sheep or oxen,\nremember those offerings now, and save my dear son—\nfend off these suitors, so haughtily arrogant, from him!’\nSo saying, she keened aloud. The goddess heard her prayer.\nThe suitors meanwhile raised uproar throughout the shadowy halls,\nand this is the kind of remark that some arrogant youth would make:\n“There’s the much-courted queen deciding which of us she’ll wed—\nnot knowing that her son’s murder’s already been arranged!”\nSo would one speak; but they didn’t know what was arranged,\nor how, and Antinoos now addressed them, saying:\n“You idiots, avoid this kind of overconfident chatter\nentirely, lest someone report it to those inside!\nSo now let’s get going in silence, and put into action\nthe scheme that we all agreed to.”\nSo he spoke,\nand picked out the twenty best men: then they together\nset off to their swift ship on the strand by the seashore.\nFirst of all they hauled the black vessel down to deep water,\nthen they set up in it both mast and sail, and fitted\nthe oars to their leather thole-straps, all in due order,\nand hoisted and set the white sail. Meanwhile their proud\nattendants carried their gear aboard. They moored the vessel\nin deep enough water, then disembarked themselves,\nate their dinner, and waited for the approach of evening.\nBut she, the prudent Penelope, lay in her upper chamber\nwithout any nourishment, tasting neither food nor drink,\nwondering whether her blameless son would escape\ndeath or be done away with by the arrogant suitors;\nand just as a lion, when cornered by men, will deliberate\nin fear, as they close their deceptive circle around him,\nso was she worrying until sweet slumber overcame her,\nand she sank back and slept, and all her joints relaxed.\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another idea:\nshe made a phantom, in form resembling a woman—\nIphthime, the daughter of great-hearted Ikarios, whom\nEumelos married, he whose home was in Pherai—\nand sent it off to the home of godlike Odysseus, there\nto tell Penelope, who still was weeping and wailing,\nthat she should give over her grief, her tearful lamentation.\nInto her room it wafted, round the strap of the door bolt,\nand stood there above her head, and addressed her, saying:\n“Are you asleep, Penelope, heart still heavy with grief?\nThe gods, the easy livers, won’t have it that you should be\nweeping and grieving: return home is yet destined for your son,\nsince in the gods’ eyes he’s no kind of transgressor.”\nThen prudent Penelope made it this answer, as she\nslumbered on sweetly, ensconced at the gates of dreams:\n“Why have you come here, sister? Never until now\nwould you visit: the home you live in lies far away.\nAnd now you tell me to quit the grieving, the countless\nagonies that beset me in mind and soul! Years ago\nI lost my good husband: a lion’s heart he possessed,\nand stood out among the Danaans for every kind of virtue:\na fine man—wide is his fame through Hellas and mid-Argos!\nAnd now my beloved son, too, has left in a hollow ship—\na mere child, with no knowledge of hardship or public debate.\nFor him it is that I grieve, even more than for the other:\nI tremble for him, I’m afraid of what he might suffer\nin the land of those he’s gone to, or out on the deep sea.\nfor many ill-wishers are plotting against him, eager\nto kill him before he gets back to his own country.”\nIn answer to her the dark phantom now declared:\n“Take heart, don’t let your mind be overweighed by panic:\na guide goes with him such as other men have prayed\nto have at their side, since hers is indeed the power—\nPallas Athene! She feels compassion for you in your sorrow.\nand it’s she who has sent me here to bring you this message.”\nThen prudent Penelope made this reply to her, saying:\n“If you’re indeed a god, and have heard this word from the goddess,\nthen come tell me the truth about that man of sorrows—\ncan it be that he’s still alive, a witness to the sunlight,\nor is he already dead, and in Hades’ realm?”\nThe dark\nphantom then answered her in these words, saying: “No,\nabout him I shall tell you nothing plainly as to\nwhether he lives or is dead. A bad thing, windy chatter.”\nSo saying, it slipped out by way of the door bolt into\nthe draught of the winds. But she, Ikarios’ daughter,\nstarted up from her sleep, her heart greatly comforted\nthat so clear a dream had reached her in the dark of the night.\nNow the suitors embarked and sailed the watery routes,\nplotting sheer murder for Telemachos in their hearts.\nThere’s a rocky islet, Asteris, out in the midst of the deep,\nhalfway between Ithake and rugged Same, not large\nbut double-harbored, safe mooring for ships; and there\nthe Achaians set up an ambush, and waited for him.\n",

         "\nAs Dawn arose from her bed beside illustrious Tithonos,\nto bring light to the immortals and to mortal mankind,\nthe gods were taking their seats in assembly, and among them\nZeus the high-thunderer, whose power is the greatest.\nAthene was speaking, reminding them of Odysseus’ many woes,\nmuch concerned by his being in the nymph’s home: “Zeus,\nFather, and you other blessed gods who live forever,\nfrom now on let no kindness or gentleness be displayed\nby a sceptered king, let his heart not cherish righteousness—\nlet him rather be ever harsh, pursue injustice, since\nthere’s nobody now who remembers godlike Odysseus\nof the people whose lord he was, and kindly as a father!\nYet now he’s stuck on an island, suffering sore affliction\nin the nymph Kalypso’s abode: she is keeping him there\nunder duress. He cannot return to his own country,\nfor he hasn’t to hand any oared ships or companions\nto carry him on his way across the broad back of the sea;\nand now they’re determined to kill, on his journey homeward,\nhis beloved son, who’d gone, seeking news of his father,\nto sacred Pylos and to splendid Lakedaimon.”\nThen in answer cloud-gathering Zeus addressed her, saying:\n“My child, what’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth?\nDid not you yourself think up the scheme whereby\nOdysseus at his homecoming might be revenged on these men?\nAs for Telemachos, guide him skillfully—you can do this—\nso that he gets back unscathed to his native country\nand the suitors go home frustrated in their intentions.”\nThat said, he addressed himself to Hermes, his dear son:\n“Hermes, since in general matters you act as our messenger,\ngo inform the fair-haired nymph of my firm decision\nregarding the return of steadfast-minded Odysseus:\nhe’s to travel without the conveyance of gods or mortals,\non a tightly lashed raft, and enduring much hardship,\nmaking landfall, twenty days on, at rich-soiled Scheria,\ncountry of the Phaiakians, who are close kin to the gods.\nThey will honor him like a god, most heartily, and send him\naboard a ship of theirs to his own native country,\nwith generous gifts of bronze and gold and clothing,\nmore than Odysseus could ever have got for himself from Troy\nhad he, unscathed, brought home his fair share of the spoils.\nThis is how he’s fated to rejoin his own people, come back\nto his high-roofed abode and his own dear native land.”\nThe guide, the slayer of Argos, did not ignore his words.\nAt once beneath his feet he tied on the fine sandals,\nambrosial, golden, that carried him over the deep\nand the boundless earth, as swift as a gale’s blast;\nand he took the wand with which he entrances the eyes\nof those he so wills, while others he’ll wake from their sleep.\nHolding this, the strong Argos-slayer was airborne, flew\nfrom the high sky over Pieria, swooped down on the sea,\nthen skimmed over the waves like a shearwater that flies\nalong the fearsome gulfs of the unharvested deep\nhunting for fish, and wets its whirring wings in the brine—\njust so did Hermes traverse that expanse of waves\nuntil he finally reached the far-distant island.\nThen he abandoned the violet deep for dry land,\nmade his way to the great cave where the fair-tressed nymph\nhad her abode, and found her at home. A great fire\nwas ablaze on the hearth: the fragrance of split cedar\nand citron wood burning spread far over the island,\nwhile she, within there, singing in a sweet voice,\nwent to and fro at the loom, wove with a golden shuttle.\nAround the cave there flourished woodland in abundance—\nalder, black poplar, and fragrant cypress—in which\nspread-winged birds had fashioned their nesting places:\nsmall horned owls, falcons, and those chattering seabirds,\ncormorants, that busy themselves far out in deep water.\nEncircling the hollow cavern there trailed a luxuriant\ngarden vine, with plentiful ripe grape clusters\nand four springs in a row, all gushing forth clear water,\nclose to each other, yet facing in different directions,\nand beyond them soft meadows of blossoming violets\nand celery: whoever might come there—an immortal, even—\nwould admire the sight, and rejoice in his heart, as now\nthe guide, the slayer of Argos, stared in admiration. But when\nin his heart he’d admired and marveled at everything, then\nhe made his way straight into the spacious cave; nor did she,\nKalypso, bright goddess, fail to know him when they met,\nfor gods, being immortal, are not strangers to each other,\neven though one may dwell in a home that’s far away.\nBut great-hearted Odysseus he did not find within there,\nfor he, as usual, was seated out on the seashore, weeping,\nrending his heart with tears and groans and sadness,\ngazing out through his tears at the unharvested sea.\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, now questioned Hermes,\nafter settling him down on a brightly gleaming chair:\n“Why, golden-staffed Hermes, honored and welcome, are you\nnow visiting me? In the past you’ve seldom come here.\nSay what you want: my heart tells me to do it\nif do it I can, and it’s something that can be done.\nBut come with me now, let me offer you entertainment.”\nSo saying, the goddess placed before him a table on which\nshe’d set out ambrosia, and mixed the red nectar for him.\nSo he ate and drank, did the guide, the slayer of Argos;\nthen, when he’d eaten and stayed his appetite with food,\nin response to her question he addressed her as follows:\n“Why am I here, you ask me, as goddess to god: I’ll give you\na full and truthful account, since that is your desire.\nZeus it was told me to come here: I didn’t want to.\nWho would willingly traverse so much salt water,\nan expanse past telling, with no city of mortals near it,\nmen who honor the gods with lavish sacrifices?\nBut no way can another god negate or circumvent\nwhat Zeus the aegis bearer has set his mind to!\nHe says there’s a man here with you, one more ill-starred\nthan all other warriors who round about Priam’s city\nbattled on for nine years; then in the tenth they sacked it\nand set off back home, but returning offended Athene,\nwho sent against them a foul storm and surging waves.\nThen all the rest of his noble companions perished,\nbut him the wind and waves bore off and carried hither,\nand him Zeus now bids you with all speed send on his way,\nsince he’s not fated to die here, far from his dear ones,\nbut it’s still his lot to see his friends and come home\nto his high-roofed house and his own dear native land.”\nSo he spoke; and Kalypso, bright among goddesses, shivered,\nand responded to him with winged words, saying: “Hard-hearted\nare you gods indeed, and jealous beyond all others,\nwho resent any goddesses sleeping with mortal men\nopenly, if they choose one such as their bedfellow!\nSo it was when rose-fingered Dawn took up with Orion—\nyou easy-living gods resented it, till at last\nin Ortygie chaste Artemis, she of the golden throne,\nwith her painless arrows assailed and killed him; so it was\nwhen fine-tressed Demeter went with Iasion, gave in\nto her passion, lay down and mingled with him\nin thrice-plowed fallow soil; not long was it before\nZeus learned of it and with his bright bolt hit and slew him.\nSo now too, gods, you resent my having a mortal companion.\nHim I saved when he was riding astride the keel,\nalone, after Zeus with his bright bolt had struck\nand shattered his swift ship out on the wine-dark sea:\nThen all the rest of his noble companions perished,\nbut him the wind and waves bore off and carried hither.\nTo him I gave friendly welcome and comfort, telling him\nI would make him immortal and ageless all his days. But since\nthere’s no way for another god to negate or circumvent\nwhat Zeus the aegis bearer has set his mind to,\nlet him go, if that’s what he has decided and so commands,\nacross the unharvested sea! But no way shall I dispatch him,\nfor I have here no oared ships, nor the crews for them,\nto send him on his way across the broad back of the sea.\nStill, I’ll be glad to advise him, I’ll hold back nothing,\nto help him get back unharmed to his own country.”\nThen the guide, the slayer of Argos, responded to her, saying:\n“So dispatch him now, and beware of the wrath of Zeus,\nlest he nurse resentment and rage against you later.”\nSo saying, the mighty slayer of Argos now departed,\nand she, the queenly nymph, went to great-hearted\nOdysseus, after hearing the message Zeus had sent her.\nHim she found on the seashore, sitting; nor were his eyes\never wiped dry of tears; sweet life was draining from him\nas he yearned to be home, since the nymph no longer pleased him.\nNights indeed he would sleep beside her perforce\nin the hollow caverns, the reluctant by the eager,\nbut all day he’d stay seated there on the stony beach,\nrending his heart with tears and sighs and sorrows,\nand wept as he gazed out over the unharvested deep. Now she,\nbright among goddesses, stood close and addressed him, saying:\n“Ill-fated man, I beg you, weep here no longer, don’t let\nyour life go to waste: I’m now ready to send you on your way!\nCome, hew long timbers with the bronze, and shape them\ninto a broad-beamed raft, fasten deck planks upon its\ntopside, to carry you over the misty deep; and I\nwill stow in it bread and water and bright red wine,\nheart-strengthening stuff, to fend off hunger from you;\nand I’ll clothe you well, and send you a good tailwind,\nto let you get back unharmed to your own country—\nthat’s if the gods wish it, they who hold the broad heavens,\nand are stronger than I am both to plan and accomplish.”\nSo she spoke, and noble much-enduring Odysseus shivered,\nand then responded to her with winged words, saying:\n“You’re planning some other thing, goddess, not my dispatch!\nOn a raft you’re bidding me cross the sea’s great gulf,\na fearful and perilous venture! Not even the best vessels,\ntrim and swift, always make it, even when given a tailwind\nby Zeus! I’ll not board any raft without your declared goodwill,\nunless you, goddess, agree to swear a mighty oath that this\nisn’t some bad new trick that you’re devising against me.”\nSo he spoke; but Kalypso bright among goddesses, smiled,\nand stroked him with her hand, and addressed him, saying:\n“What a rogue you are, and by no means feeble-minded,\nthat it occurred to you to address me in those terms!\nVery well: let earth bear witness, and the wide heaven above,\nand the cascade of Styx, the greatest and most dread\nof all oaths observed and taken among the blessed gods,\nthat this is no bad new trick that I’m plotting against you;\nno, my plans and considerations are such as I’d devise\nfor my own personal use, should such a need come on me.\nMy intentions are good, and the heart within my breast\nis not made of iron, but compassionate.”\nWith those words\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, went on ahead,\nat a brisk pace, and he followed in the goddess’ footsteps.\nThey came to the hollow cavern, goddess and man together,\nand there he settled himself on the same chair from which\nHermes had risen, while the nymph set all kinds of food\nbefore him to eat and drink, such stuff as mortals feed on,\nand she herself sat down facing godlike Odysseus,\nand her handmaids brought out for her ambrosia and nectar.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, was the first to speak:\n“Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, most resourceful Odysseus,\nare you really so set on making your way back home\nto your own land at once? Yet I wish you well regardless!\nIf you only knew in your heart the full measure of trouble\nit’s your fate to incur before you reach your homeland,\nyou’d rather stay here with me, and keep this house,\nand be immortal, despite your longing to see\nyour wife, whom you pine for always, day in, day out!\nI may indeed rightly claim not to be her inferior\nin either figure or stature, since no way is it seemly\nfor mortal women to rival a goddess in form or beauty.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n“Don’t resent this, my lady goddess: I myself know well\nthat prudent Penelope is in every way less striking\nin appearance than you, whether for stature or beauty,\nsince she’s a mortal woman, whereas you’re immortal, ageless!\nYet even so what I want and yearn for all my days\nIs to make it back home, to see the day of my returning!\nThough some god may wreck me again on the wine-dark deep,\nI will endure: the heart in my breast can bear much trouble!\nBefore now I’ve suffered much, have labored greatly\namid waves and in warfare: to all that let this be added.”\nSo he spoke: the sun went down, and darkness came on.\nThey repaired to the inmost recess of the hollow cavern\nand made love with pleasure, clasping each other close.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nOdysseus promptly put on a tunic and cloak, while she,\nthe nymph, also dressed herself in a long white robe,\nfine-textured and beautiful, with an exquisite golden sash\nabout her waist, and placed a veil on her head. She then\nbegan to plan the dispatch of great-hearted Odysseus. First\nshe brought him a large axe, well fitted to his grasp,\nof bronze, sharp, double-bladed, with its splendid\nhandle of olive wood firmly attached. She also\ngave him a finely made adze. Then she led the way\nto the far end of the island, where there stood tall trees—\nalder and poplar, and fir that reached sky-high,\ndried out and seasoned, that would ride for him buoyantly.\nBut when she had shown him where the tall trees grew,\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, went back home, while he\nset himself to fell timber. The work progressed apace:\ntwenty trees he felled, and trimmed them with the bronze,\nthen skillfully smoothed them, made them true to the line.\nNow Kalypso, bright among goddesses, brought him augers:\nhe bored through all the timbers, fitted them to each other,\nforced home and matched the joints, made them secure\nwith tree nails. Just as wide as the curve of the hull\nthat a skillful shipwright marks off for a broad-beamed freighter\nwas the width that Odysseus gave his raft. He fitted\ndeck beams in, matched them firm to the close-set ribs,\nworking away, and finished with lengthy gunwales.\nNext he set up a mast and attached a yardarm to it,\nand fashioned a steering oar with which to set his course.\nThen he fenced the raft overall with osier wattles,\nagainst the waves, and added a bed of brushwood dunnage.\nKalypso meanwhile, bright among goddesses, brought him\ncloth to fashion a sail from: this too he did with skill,\nand added tackle—braces and sheets and halyards—\nand used levers to shift the raft down to the bright salt deep.\nIt was now the fourth day, and all his work was finished.\nOn the fifth, bright Kalypso saw him off from the island\nwhen she’d bathed him and dressed him in fresh-scented garments.\nOn the raft the goddess put one skin of dark wine,\nand another, a large one, of water, along with provisions\nin a leather bag—cooked meat in plenty to boost his strength—\nand raised a good following wind, warm and propitious.\nHappily then to the breeze did noble Odysseus spread\nhis sail as he sat at the steering oar and skillfully\nmarked off his course; nor did sleep fall upon his eyelids\nas he steadily watched the Pleiades and late-setting Bootes\nand the Bear, which men also know as the Wagon, that circles\nin the place where it is, and keeps one eye on Orion,\nand alone never dips below the baths of Ocean.\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, had instructed him\nto keep this star on his left hand as he traversed the deep.\nFor seventeen days he sailed on over the sea, and on\nthe eighteenth there showed up the shadowy mountains\nof the Phaiakians’ land, where it came closest to him,\nresembling a shield laid out on the misty sea.\nBut the mighty Earth-Shaker, coming back from the Aithiopians,\nsaw him far off, from the Solymoi’s mountains, visible\nsailing over the deep, and waxed wrathful at the sight,\nand shook his head, and thus communed with himself:\n“Damn it, the gods have certainly changed their minds\nas regards Odysseus while I was away with the Aithiopians!\nNow he’s near the Phaiakians’ land, where it’s his destiny\nto escape the great crisis of suffering that’s come on him.\nEven so, I think I’ll yet give him his fill of trouble!”\nSo saying he gathered the clouds, and roiled up the deep,\nwielding his trident; he urged on to gale force every last\nwind in existence, he used the clouds to blot out\nboth land and sea: nightfall dropped down from heaven,\nthe east, south, and fierce west winds now drove together,\nwhile the skyborne north wind rolled a huge wave before it,\nand Odysseus’ knees and heart gave way, and deeply\nshaken he now addressed his own great-hearted spirit:\n“Ah, wretch that I am, what’s my ultimate fate to be?\nAll that the goddess told me, I fear, is true—\nshe said that out on the deep, before I reached my homeland\nI’d get my fill of trouble, and now it’s all happening!\nLook at the clouds with which Zeus is obscuring the wide\nheavens, the way he’s roiled up the sea, how the blasts\nof all the winds drive at me! Now my sheer destruction’s\nfor certain! Thrice and four times blessed those Danaans\nwho perished in Troy’s broad land, bringing aid to Atreus’ sons:\nHow I wish I too had died then, had met my fate that day\nwhen a mass of Trojans pelted me with their bronze-tipped spears,\nbattling around the dead son of Peleus! Then\nI’d have had proper burial, and from the Achaians renown:\nwhereas now I’m doomed to suffer a most piteous death.”\nAs he spoke, a huge wave bore down on him from above,\nwith fearful force, and spun his raft clean around:\nfar from the raft he fell, the steering oar was torn\nfrom his grasp, the mast cracked in two, hit squarely\nby a gale-force gust from the winds in wild confusion,\nso that sail and yardarm fell far off into the deep.\nHim the sea long kept submerged, nor was he able\nto come up at once from the great wave’s onrush: the clothes\nthat bright Kalypso had given him weighed him down.\nHe finally reached the surface, spat out the briny\nsea water that streamed off his head; yet not even so,\nfor all his exhaustion, did he lose sight of his raft,\nbut pursued it amid the waves, somehow caught hold of it,\nand clambered aboard and clung there, evading death’s end,\nwhile the great seas bore it onward, this way and that.\nAs when in autumn the north wind blows thistledown\nover the plain, and the tufts cling close together,\nso hither and thither the winds now carried the raft\nover the sea: now south wind would toss it to north\nto sweep onward, now east would yield it to west’s pursuit.\nBut Kadmos’ daughter caught sight of him, neat-ankled Ino,\nwhite goddess, who once was a mortal, and so spoke,\nbut now in the sea’s depths had found honor from the gods.\nShe pitied Odysseus, so sea-tossed, so racked with troubles,\nmade her way up like a shearwater from the depths, then perched\non the strongly corded raft, and addressed him, saying:\n“Poor man, why, pray, does Poseidon the Earth-Shaker\nhate you so much that he afflicts you with all these troubles?\nYet despite his fury he shan’t completely destroy you!\nNow: do as I tell you: you seem not lacking in common sense.\nStrip off those clothes, leave your raft for the winds to play with,\nand yourself use your arms as a swimmer, strive to make it\nto the Phaiakians’ land, where your escape is destined!\nAnd come, take this veil, bind it firmly about your body:\nIt’s immortal, so have no fear that you’ll come to harm, or perish!\nBut when your hands grasp the mainland, then untie it\nand fling it far out into the wine-dark deep,\nwell away from the land, and yourself turn your back on it.”\nSo saying, the goddess handed over the veil,\nand herself plunged back down into the surging deep\nlike a shearwater: the dark wave hid her. Then noble\nmuch-enduring Odysseus reflected, and, deeply shaken,\nnow addressed his own great-hearted spirit, saying:\n“Alas, I fear some immortal is once more weaving a snare\nagainst me, and that’s why she told me to leave the raft!\nI’ll not obey her yet: with my own eyes I saw, far distant,\nthat land where she said I’d find my destined safety.\nThis is what I shall do, and to me it seems my best course:\nSo long as the timbers hold firm, their joints unbroken,\nI shall stay put, and endure the troubles that I’m facing;\nBut when the waves have shattered the raft to pieces\nthen I’ll swim for it, since there’s no better plan.”\nWhile thus\nhe pondered the matter in mind and heart, Poseidon,\nthe Earth-Shaker, now conjured up a gigantic wave—\nfearsome and grim, overarching—and launched it at him.\nAs when a gusting wind whisks up a heap of dried-out\nhusks, and scatters some here, some there, just so\nthe wave strewed the raft’s long timbers; and now Odysseus\nsat astride one beam, like someone riding a horse,\nstripped off the garments that bright Kalypso gave him,\nquickly tied round his body the veil, and flung himself\nheadfirst into the sea, both arms outstretched, prepared\nto swim for his life. The mighty Earth-Shaker saw him,\nand shook his head, and thus communed with his heart:\n“So, after all your troubles, go drifting over the deep\nuntil you meet with those men who are Zeus’ nurslings!\nYet even so I don’t think you’ll underrate your hardships.”\nSo saying, he whipped up his beautifully maned horses\nand went on to Aigai, where he has his famed abode.\nBut Zeus’ daughter Athene had a different notion:\nthe other winds she now stopped short in their tracks,\nmade them all die down and be lulled to sleep, but the swift\nnorth wind she aroused, parting the waves before it,\nto let Zeus’ scion Odysseus get through to the oar-loving\nPhaiakians, after escaping death and death’s harbingers.\nTwo nights and two days now over the heaving swell\nhe pressed on: many times his heart saw destruction ahead.\nBut when fair-haired Dawn brought the third morning on,\nthen the wind dropped, and there followed a windless calm,\nand he sighted land close ahead of him, as he took\na quick glance forward, lifted up by a swelling wave.\nAs most welcome appear to his children renewed signs of life\nin a father who’s laid on a sickbed, suffering agonies,\nlong wasting away, attacked by some hateful spirit,\nbut then, oh joy, the gods free him from his illness—\nso welcome seemed to Odysseus the land and its forest,\nand he swam on, longing to set foot on solid earth.\nBut when as close to land as a man’s shout carries,\nhearing the crash of the breakers against the reefs—\nfor the huge wave thundered as it smashed into dry land,\nroaring terribly: all around was misted in salt sea spray,\nand there were no harbors to dock ships, no roadsteads either,\nnothing but jutting headlands, and reefs and rocks—\nthen the knees and heart of Odysseus gave way together,\nand deeply shaken he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:\n“Oh no, now Zeus has granted me an unlooked-for\nglimpse of dry land, and I’ve plowed my way through this gulf,\nno way of escape can I see from the grey brine, for offshore\nare sharp rocks, and all around them the waves surge up\nroaring, the cliff-face towers sheer above them; the seawater\nruns deep close in to land, so there’s no way to stand firm\non both feet and escape destruction: I fear as I’m coming ashore\nsome huge wave may scoop me up and dash me against\na sharp rough rock, putting paid to all my efforts.\nBut if I swim further along, to see if I maybe can find\nbays where the waves strike aslant, or safe harbors from the sea,\nI’m afraid that the storm winds may snatch me up once more,\nand bear me back, groaning heavily, over the fish-rich deep,\nor a marine divinity may send some huge monster against me\nout of the sea, one of many that famed Amphitrite breeds—\nfor I know how deeply the famed Earth-Shaker hates me.”\nWhile he brooded upon these matters in mind and spirit\na great wave flung him forward against the rocky shoreline.\nThere would his bones have been crushed and his skin ripped off\nhad not grey-eyed Athene, the goddess, put a thought in his mind:\nwith both hands, plunging forward, he seized the rock,\nand clung to it, gasping, while the great wave rushed by.\nThus this one he dodged, but its backwash caught and struck him\nand carried him off, flung him far out to sea.\nJust as an octopus, when dragged up out of its lair,\nwill have clusters of pebbles sticking fast to its suckers,\nso from his powerful hands against the rock were scraps\nof skin stripped off as the great wave went over him.\nBeyond his fate, then, surely would wretched Odysseus\nhave died, had not grey-eyed Athene sharpened his wits.\nComing up out of the surge as it discharged on the shore\nhe swam outside, eyeing the land, to see if he could find\nbays where the waves struck aslant, or safe harbors from the sea.\nBut when, as he swam, he came on the mouth of a flowing\nriver, this struck him as the best possible place,\nbeing free of stones, and well sheltered from the wind.\nHe recognized the live current, and made a silent prayer:\n“Hear me, lord, whoever you are, and to me most welcome:\nfrom the deep I come to you, fleeing Poseidon’s threats—\nSacrosanct, even to the immortal gods, is that man\nwho comes as a wanderer, as I come now to your\ncurrent, and to your knees, after many hardships:\nSo pity me, lord: your suppliant I hereby declare myself.”\nThus he spoke; at once the god stopped flowing, checked the waves,\ncreated a calm before him, brought him safe and sound\nto the river’s mouth. Both knees now lost their strength\nand his strong hands too: the salt deep had crushed his spirit,\nall his flesh was swollen, seawater oozed in streams\nout through his mouth and nostrils. Breathless, speechless\nhe lay, barely stirring: dire exhaustion had overcome him.\nWhen he got his breath back, and the heart revived in his breast,\nhe then unwound the goddess’ veil from his body\nand dropped it into the seaward-flowing river. A great\nwave now carried it back downstream, and Ino quickly\ngathered it into her hands. Odysseus turned from the river,\ncollapsed in the reeds, and kissed the grain-giving earth.\nDeeply shaken he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:\n“Ah, what must I suffer? What’s my ultimate fate to be?\nIf I keep watch here by the river all the irksome night\nI’m afraid the hard frost and the chilly dew between them,\nbecause of my weakness, may quell my gasping spirit—\nand the breeze off the river blows cold before the dawn.\nBut if I climb the slope to the shadowy forest\nand lie down among the dense thickets, then even if cold\nand exhaustion don’t touch me, and I enjoy sweet sleep,\nI fear I may end as the spoil and prey of wild beasts.”\nAs he reflected, it struck him this last was the best course.\nHe set off into the maquis and found what he wanted near\nthe water, beside a clearing. He crept in under two bushes,\nevergreen thorn and wild olive, that grew from the same spot.\nThrough these the damp winds’ violence could never blow,\nnor the rays of the bright sun penetrate, nor storms\nof rain pierce their defenses, so densely they grew,\ninterlaced the one with the other. In under these\nOdysseus crept, and with his hands briskly swept\na wide bed of leaves together. Dried fallen leaves were there\nin abundance, enough to give shelter to two or three men\nin the winter season, however severe the weather.\nSeeing this, much-enduring noble Odysseus rejoiced:\nhe lay down in the middle, heaped fallen leaves over him.\nAs a man hides a smoldering log under dark embers\nfar out in the countryside, a man who has no neighbors,\nto save a seed of fire, and not need to rekindle it,\nso Odysseus piled leaves over himself, and Athene\nshed sleep on his eyes, to free him as soon as might be\nfrom toilsome exhaustion, wrap his eyelids in darkness.\n",

         "\nSo Odysseus slept on there, godlike and much-enduring,\nworn out by exhaustion and hardship; and meanwhile Athene\nwent off to the district and city of the Phaiakians, who\nat one time made their home in spacious Hypereia,\nand were neighbors to the Kyklopes, rough arrogant men,\nwho kept raiding them, and were more powerful. Godlike\nNausithoos then uprooted them, led them to Scheria,\nremote from bread-eating mortals, settled them there.\nHe ran a wall round the city, constructed houses,\nmade shrines for the gods, shared out the arable acres.\nBut by now he’d succumbed to his fate, gone down to Hades,\nand Alkinoos was the ruler, who had wisdom from the gods.\nTo his dwelling now went the goddess, grey-eyed Athene,\nwith her plan for great-hearted Odysseus’ return home.\nShe entered the ornate bedroom in which there slept a girl\nmost like the immortals in form and appearance: Nausikaa,\ndaughter of great-hearted Alkinoos, with close by her\ntwo handmaids, made beautiful by the Graces, one on each\nside of the doorposts; and the bright doors were shut.\nLike a breath of wind she now swept in to the girl’s bedside,\nand stood above her head, and addressed her, assuming\nthe form of the daughter of Dymas, famous for his ships—\na girl Nausikaa’s age, and very dear to her heart.\nIn her likeness grey-eyed Athene spoke to her, saying:\n“Nausikaa, how could your mother have so careless a child?\nYour bright smart clothes are all lying about uncared-for,\nyet your marriage is near, when you’ll need fine clothes for yourself,\nand garments, too, to provide for those who’ll escort you.\nThis is the kind of thing that gets you well spoken of\namong men, and pleases your father and lady mother!\nSo let’s go and do the washing tomorrow at daybreak:\nI’ll come with you as helper, let you make yourself ready\nas soon as may be: you won’t be unmarried much longer!\nAlready suitors are courting you, the noblest Phaiakians\nin these parts—and you share their lineage! So come now,\nurge your far-famed father, first thing this morning,\nto have mules and a wagon ready, to carry for you\nthe sashes and robes and bright coverlets. And for yourself\nit’s much better to travel this way than to go by foot:\nthe washing troughs are a long way distant from the city.”\nThat said, the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, departed\nfor Olympos, where, they say, the gods have their abode\nforever immovable, never shaken by gales nor wet\nwith rain, nor does snow ever visit them; the sky\nstretches dazzling and cloudless, the upper air gleams white.\nThe blessed gods find enjoyment here all their days,\nand here the grey-eyed one went, after speaking with the girl.\nNow Dawn on her fine throne arrived, and woke up the latter,\nthe finely robed Nausikaa. She at once, amazed by her dream,\nwent off through the house to report it to her parents,\nher own dear father and mother. She found them in:\nher mother sitting there at the hearth with her handmaids,\nspinning sea-purple yarn on a distaff; her father she caught\non the point of leaving to join the distinguished elders\nin council, summoned there by the lords of Phaiakia.\nShe went up to her dear father, and addressed him thus:\n“Dear Papa, won’t you please have a wagon made ready for me—\nthe high one, with good wheels, so I can take the fine\nclothes that are lying here soiled to the river for washing?\nFor you too it’s proper, when you’re with the chief men\ndebating in council, to be wearing fresh-laundered clothes,\nand you’ve five sons living with you, here in your halls,\ntwo married, but three lively bachelors, who always\ninsist on having fresh-laundered clothes to put on\nfor going to the dance: all this now needs my attention.”\nSo she spoke, too embarrassed to mention lusty marriage\nto her father; but he understood all, and responded, saying:\n“I begrudge you neither the mules, child, nor anything else,\nso off you go: the servants will ready the wagon for you—\nthe high one, with good wheels, and fitted bodywork.”\nWith that he called to the servants, and they obeyed him.\nThey made ready the good-wheeled mule wagon outside,\nand brought the mules, and yoked and harnessed them,\nwhile the girl fetched out the bright garments from indoors,\nand stowed them away in the polished cart, and her mother\nadded a box full of satisfying things to eat—\nappetizers galore, and poured out a measure of wine\nin a goatskin bottle. Nausikaa boarded the wagon,\nand her mother gave her a golden flask full of soft oil, with which\nshe and her handmaids could massage themselves. She now\ntook hold of the whip and the brightly polished reins,\nand whipped up the mules to start them. They clattered off\nat a smart trot, not pausing, with girl and laundry aboard—\nnot alone, for her handmaids all came along with her.\nWhen they reached the sweet flow of the river, at the site\nof the regular wash troughs—always enough clean water\nfrom springs there or outflow to clean the dirtiest garments—\nthen they unhitched the mules, set them free from the wagon,\nand shooed them off along the bank of the eddying river\nto graze on honey-sweet clover, while they themselves\ntook armfuls of clothes from the wagon to the dark water\nand trod them out in the basins, fast-moving, competitive.\nThen after they’d washed them and got them clean again\nthey spread them in rows on the shoreline, where the surf\nbeating upon the strand had most clearly scoured the pebbles.\nThen they bathed, and rubbed themselves down with oil,\nand ate their lunch beside the banks of the river\nwhile waiting until the clothes dried off in the bright sunlight.\nWhen the handmaids and Nausikaa had eaten their fill\nthey then threw off their veils and turned to playing ball,\nand white-armed Nausikaa was their leader as they sang.\nJust as the archer Artemis roams across mountain ranges—\nlofty Taygetos, say, or Erymanthos—exulting\nin her pursuit of wild boar or of the swift-footed deer,\nand country nymphs, daughters of Zeus the aegis bearer,\njoin the sport with her, and Leto rejoices at the sight\nof Artemis, head and brow higher than all the others,\nand easily recognized, though each one is beautiful:\nso amid all her handmaids shone out this unwed maiden.\nBut when she was on the point of starting back homeward,\nwith the mules yoked up and the fine clothes folded, then\nthe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another idea:\nthat Odysseus should wake, and see the sweet-faced girl,\nand that she should escort him to the Phaiakians’ city.\nSo when the princess next tossed the ball to a handmaid\nshe missed the handmaid, and sent it into a deep eddy.\nThey all cried out at length, and noble Odysseus awoke,\nand sat up, wondering in his mind and heart: “Ah me,\namong what sort of mortals have I now made landfall?\nAre they wild and outrageous, men with no sense of justice,\nor hospitable to strangers, a god-fearing people? An outcry\nof women—young girls—just echoed round about me:\nthe nymphs, it could be, who haunt the sheer mountain peaks\nand the rivers’ springs and the grassy meadows! Or am I\nsomewhere near talking humans? Well, come on now,\nlet me take a look for myself, see what I can discover.”\nThat said, godlike Odysseus came out from under the bushes.\nStrong-handed, he broke off a leafy branch from the dense\nmaquis to cover his body, hide the male parts. He came forth\nlike some mountain-bred lion, confident in his strength,\nwho, beaten by wind and rain, still advances, both his eyes\nablaze, as in among cattle or sheep he hastens, or in\npursuit of wild deer: his ravenous belly drives him\nto go after the flocks even inside the close-walled farmstead.\nSo Odysseus was set to mingle, though naked, among these\nfair-tressed young girls: such need had come upon him.\nA terrifying sight they found him, all crusted with dried brine,\nand they scattered in panic around the jutting sand-spits.\nAlkinoos’ daughter alone stood firm, for Athene had put\ncourage into her heart, and purged the fear from her limbs.\nShe stood still, holding her ground. Odysseus debated—should he\nclasp the knees of this good-looking girl when making his plea,\nor should he stay put, just cajole her with honey-sweet phrases\nso she’d give him clothes, show him the way into town?\nAs he thus reflected, he decided that it would be better\nto stay put, just cajole her with honey-sweet phrases—\nthe girl might take offense if he grabbed her knees!\nSo he made an impromptu speech, both honey-sweet and crafty:\n“By your knees I entreat you, lady—some goddess are you,\nor mortal? If a goddess, one of those who hold broad heaven,\nthen to Artemis, great Zeus’ daughter, I find you most\nnearly akin in beauty and height and carriage; but if\nyou’re mortal, one of those who dwell here on earth, then thrice\nblessed indeed are your father and the lady your mother,\nthrice blessed your brothers! Greatly warmed with pleasure\nmust their hearts always be on your account, as they see\nso fine an offshoot taking her place among the dancers!\nBut blessed at heart, far above all others, is he\nwho’ll dower you with bride-gifts and lead you to his home!\nNever before have my eyes seen a mortal such as you are,\neither man or woman: I’m awed at the sight of you!\nOn Delos once, beside Apollo’s altar, I saw\nsomething like you: a young palm-shoot springing up—\nI put in there, along with a crowd of followers,\non the same journey fated to bring me such misfortune—\nand likewise at that sight I was long in awe,\nsince never before had such a tree sprung from earth!\nJust so, lady, I’m awed and amazed by you, and greatly\nfear now to touch your knees. Much hardship has assailed me:\nfor twenty days—until yesterday, when I got clear\nof the wine-dark sea—the waves and storm winds bore me\naway from the isle of Ogygia. Now some god’s landed me here,\nI guess, to suffer more trouble, for I don’t suppose\nit’ll stop now: the gods have plenty in store for me still.\nSo, lady, show me compassion: after all my suffering\nyou’re the first person I’ve met—not a single other one\ndo I know of all those who possess this city and this country.\nJust show me the way into town, give me some rag to wear—\nmaybe you had a wrapper for the clothes you brought here?—\nand may the gods grant you all that your heart desires,\nhusband, home, and like-mindedness—a precious gift,\nfor there’s nothing greater or better, ever, than when two\nlike-minded people are keeping house together,\na man and his wife: much frustration for their ill-wishers,\nmuch joy for their friends, but they two know it the best.”\nThen white-armed Nausikaa made him this answer: “Stranger,\nyou seem neither malicious nor witless: but it’s Zeus,\nthe Olympian in person, who bestows good fortune on men,\nthe good and the bad, to each as he wills; I suppose\nhe chose this lot for you, and you just have to bear it.\nBut now, since it’s our land and city that you’ve come to,\nyou’ll not go short of clothing nor of anything else\nthat befits a long-suffering suppliant on arrival.\nI’ll show you the way into town, name the inhabitants:\nit’s the Phaiakians who possess this land and city,\nand I am the daughter of great-hearted Alkinoos,\nin whom the Phaiakians’ power and might are vested.”\nThat said, she snapped out orders to her fair-tressed handmaids:\n“Come back here, girls! Scuttling off when you see a man?\nDo you really suppose he’s some kind of enemy?\nThere’s no mortal alive, nor could there ever be one,\nwho’d show up in this land of Phaiakian men\nwith hostile intent, so dear are we to the immortals!\nRemote is our dwelling, far off in the surging deep;\nnone further distant, other mortals don’t mix with us.\nNo, this is some ill-starred drifter who’s ended up here,\nand we must now take care of, since from Zeus are all\nstrangers and beggars: any gift, though small, is welcome.\nSo come, girls, provide this stranger with food and drink,\nand wash him off in the river, well sheltered from the wind.”\nSo she spoke. They stopped, and encouraged one another,\nand brought Odysseus to shelter, just as Nausikaa,\ndaughter of great-hearted Alkinoos, had told them to do,\nand put beside him a mantle and tunic to wear, and gave him\nthe golden flask containing soft liquid olive oil,\nand offered to wash him off in the flow of the river.\nThen godlike Odysseus addressed the handmaids, saying:\n“Handmaids, stand further off, leave me on my own\nto scrub off the brine from my shoulders, rub myself over\nwith oil—indeed it’s a long time since oil came near my skin.\nI’m not going to bathe in your presence: I feel embarrassed\nto be naked among all you fair-tressed young ladies.”\nSo he spoke. They went back, told Nausikaa what he’d said.\nNow godlike Odysseus scrubbed off with river water\nthe brine encrusting his back and his broad shoulders,\nand wiped the unharvested sea’s scurf from his head;\nthen when he’d washed all over, and rubbed himself with oil,\nand had put on the clothes that the unwed girl provided,\nthen Athene, offspring of Zeus, made him in appearance\ntaller and stronger, made the hair spring from his head\nin rich curls, like the flower of the hyacinth. As when a man\noverlays silver with gold, a skillful artisan who’s been\ntaught every craft by Hephaistos and Pallas Athene,\nand thus turns out the most elegant handiwork,\nsuch was the grace she shed upon his head and shoulders.\nThen he took himself off, sat down on the seashore\nagleam with beauty and grace: the girl stared, awestruck,\nand addressed her fair-tressed handmaids, saying: “Listen,\nmy white-armed handmaids: let me tell you something!\nNot without the gods’ will—all the gods who hold Olympos—\nhas this man come here to mingle with the godlike Phaiakians!\nBefore, he seemed to me to be mean and shabby,\nwhereas now he resembles the gods who possess broad heaven!\nIf only a man such as this could be chosen as my husband—\ncould be domiciled here—might even want to stay here!\nBut come, girls, provide the stranger with food and drink.”\nSo she spoke, and they readily heard and obeyed her,\nand set before Odysseus both food and drink. So now\nthe much-enduring godlike Odysseus both ate and drank,\nravenously, since he’d gone a long time without food.\nNow white-armed Nausikaa had one more thought. She folded\nthe clothes, and stowed them in the beautiful wagon,\nand yoked the hard-hoofed mules, and climbed aboard herself.\nThen she called out to Odysseus, addressed him directly:\n“Get up now, stranger, and I’ll guide you to town, direct you\nto my wise father’s house, where, I promise you, you’ll make\nthe acquaintance of all the best of the Phaiakians.\nBut be sure to do as I say—and you don’t strike me as witless.\nAs long as we’re out in the countryside, fields and farmland,\ncome briskly along with my girls behind the mules\nand wagon; I’ll lead the way. But when we’re about\nto enter the city—there’s a high wall round it, a fine\nharbor on either side of the city, with a narrow entrance,\nand trim vessels are moored all along the way, each one\nwith a slip of its own, private docking for everyone;\nthere too is the place of assembly, by Poseidon’s fine precinct,\nmarked out with great deep-bedded quarried stones,\nand it’s there that they busy themselves with the black ships’ tackle,\ntheir cables and sails, and there that they trim their oar blades;\nfor bows and quivers are not the Phaiakians’ concern,\nbut ships’ masts, oars, and the trim vessels themselves,\nin which with delight they traverse the sea’s grey waters.\nIt’s their rude comments I want to avoid, the chance that later\nsome man may blame me—there are unkind folk among us—\nand one of the nastier sort might say if he met us:\n‘Who’s this tall handsome stranger tagging after Nausikaa?\nWhere did she pick him up? Her husband-to-be, no doubt!\nSome stray off a ship she’ll be bringing in, I suppose,\nfrom a foreign crew—there aren’t any from hereabouts—\nunless some god’s come down from heaven in answer\nto her endless prayers, and she’ll keep him around for life!\nBetter, if she herself went off and found a husband\nelsewhere, since she despises these men here in the district,\nthough many top-class Phaiakians are courting her.’ So they’ll say,\nand such remarks would attach a scandal to my name.\nI too would disapprove if another girl behaved thus—\none that in defiance of her dear father and mother\nconsorted with men before reaching the day of public marriage.\nSo, stranger, quickly grasp what I’m telling you, to ensure\nprompt assistance from my father in getting you back home.\nYou’ll find a fine grove of Athene near the road, a grove\nof poplars; a spring gushes up in it, there’s a meadow round it.\nThat’s where my father’s estate is, his flourishing orchard—\nas far from town as the shout of a man will carry.\nSit down there and wait a while, long enough for us\nto get to the city, arrive at my father’s house. But when\nyou reckon we’ve made it home, then yourself go on\nto the city of the Phaiakians, and ask around\nwhere you can find the house of great-hearted Alkinoos.\nIt’s easily recognized—even a child could guide you,\nthe merest infant, since the other Phaiakians’ houses\naren’t built on a scale to match the abode of heroic\nAlkinoos! Then, when you reach that the house and courtyard,\ngo quickly through the main hall, until you come upon\nmy mother—you’ll find her sitting in firelight by the hearth,\nspinning sea-purple yarn on a distaff, a wonderful sight,\nleaning against a pillar, her maids seated behind her;\nand there is my father’s throne, set close by her side,\nwhere he sits and drinks his wine like an immortal.\nGo on past him, throw your arms round the knees\nof my mother, if you’re to get a quick and happy glimpse\nof your day of homecoming, no matter how far you’ve come:\nit’s if she looks on you with favor in her heart\nthat there’s hope for you of seeing your people, of getting\nback to your own strong house and your native country.”\nSo saying, she lashed out with her shining whip at the mules,\nand they quickly took off, away from the flowing river:\nthey trotted well, well did they ply their feet, and she drove\ntaking good care that Odysseus and her handmaids\ncould keep up on foot, used her whip very sparingly.\nAs the sun set they reached the famous grove, sacred\nto Athene. Here godlike Odysseus sat himself down,\nand at once made his prayer to great Zeus’ daughter: “Hear me,\nunwearying child of Zeus of the aegis! Listen now,\nas you failed to listen before when I was stricken,\nwhen the far-famed Earth-Shaker struck me! Grant that now\nwhen I come among the Phaiakians I’m befriended and pitied.”\nSo he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him,\nbut did not yet show herself to him, for she respected\nher father’s brother, who continued to rage against\ngodlike Odysseus until he got back to his own country.\n",

         "\nSo while Odysseus prayed there, godlike and much-enduring,\nthe strength of her two mules bore the girl back to town.\nWhen she arrived at her father’s renowned abode\nshe pulled up in the forecourt. Her brothers, men like immortals,\ncame out, crowded round her, unyoked the mules\nfrom the wagon, carried the laundry indoors, while she\nherself went to her room. There a fire was lit for her by\nan old crone from Apeire, her chambermaid, Eurymedousa.\nLong ago the trim ships had brought her back from Apeire,\nand they’d chosen her as a prize for Alkinoos, since he ruled\nover all the Phaiakians: the people obeyed him like a god.\nShe’d reared white-armed Nausikaa in his halls; now it was she\nwho lit her a fire and made ready her supper in her room.\nThen Odysseus got up to go to the city, and Athene,\nwishing him well, shed a thick mist round about him,\nso that no great-hearted Phaiakian whom he encountered\nshould address him in uncivil terms, ask who he might be;\nthen, when he was about to enter the pleasant city,\nthe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, met him, in the guise\nof a young virginal girl with a pitcher. She stopped before him,\nand godlike Odysseus questioned her, saying: “My child,\ncould you not guide me to the house of a man by name\nAlkinoos, who’s the ruler among the people here?\nI’m a long-suffering stranger, come from a remote\nand far-off country, so I possess no knowledge\nof the people who occupy this city and its land.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying:\n“Yes, stranger, father, I can show you the house you want,\nfor this man’s the neighbor of my own illustrious father!\nJust keep silent and follow where I lead the way—\nDon’t catch anyone’s eye, or ask them questions,\nfor the folk hereabouts have little patience with strangers,\nand are short on welcome for those from another country.\nThey rely on the swiftness of the racing vessels in which\nthey traverse the sea’s great gulf, a gift from the Earth-Shaker:\ntheir ships contrive all the speed of a wing or a thought.”\nHaving said this, Pallas Athene then led the way\nbriskly, and he followed in the goddess’ footsteps.\nNor did the Phaiakians, famed for their ships, observe him\ngoing through the city among them; fair-tressed Athene,\ndread goddess, did not allow it: she shed a marvelous\nmist over him, out of the kindness she bore him in her heart.\nOdysseus gazed in wonder at the trim ships and the harbors,\nthe heroes’ assembly places, the city walls long and high\nand fitted with palisades, a marvelous sight to behold.\nWhen they arrived at the king’s magnificent dwelling\nthe first to speak was the goddess, grey-eyed Athene:\n“Here is the house, stranger, father, that you asked me to show you!\nYou’ll find Zeus’ nurslings, the princes, right inside there\neating their dinner. Go in, and don’t let your heart\nshow alarm: a man whose every move speaks boldness\ndoes better, even supposing he comes from some other country.\nThe first person you’ll met in the great hall is its mistress:\nArete’s the name by which she’s known, and she comes\nof the very same stock that bred Alkinoos, the king.\nNausithoos first Poseidon, the Earth-Shaker,\nsired on Periboia, a woman of matchless beauty,\nthe youngest daughter of great-hearted Eurymedon,\nwho once ruled as king over the arrogant Giants,\nbut destroyed his reckless people and was destroyed himself.\nWith her Poseidon lay in love and begot a son,\ngreat-hearted Nausithoos, who ruled the Phaiakians,\nand Nausithoos sired Alkinoos and Rhexenor.\nApollo, the silver-bowed, struck Rhexenor down\nwhile a sonless bridegroom, who left one daughter only,\nArete: her Alkinoos took as his wife, and honored\nas no other woman upon this earth is honored\nof all those who run their households subject to men,\nso honored at heart is she, and ever has been,\nby her dear children and by Alkinoos himself,\nand by the people, who look upon her as a goddess\nand so greet her when she goes abroad through the city;\nfor she herself is in no way lacking in judgment\nand settles disputes with goodwill, even those between men.\nSo if she’s well disposed toward you, then there’s a chance\nthat you’ll get to see your own people, make it back home\nto your high-roofed house and your own native land.”\nSo saying, grey-eyed Athene now departed, over\nthe unharvested sea, took off from delightful Scheria\nand came to Marathon and wide-streeted Athens,\nand entered the close-set house of Erechtheus. But Odysseus\nwent to Alkinoos’ splendid abode. Much his heart pondered\nas he stood there, even before he reached its brazen threshold,\nfor there was a radiance as of the sun or the moon\nover the high-roofed home of great-hearted Alkinoos.\nBronze walls stretched this way and that to the inmost\nroom from the threshold, framed by a cobalt frieze;\ngolden doors safeguarded the close-built inner domain,\nwith silver doorposts set in a threshold of bronze,\nand silver the lintel above, and of gold the door-latch.\nOn either side of each door stood gold and silver dogs\ncreated with consummate skill by Hephaistos and set there\nto keep watch over the house of great-hearted Alkinoos:\nimmortal creatures and ageless all their days.\nInside, chairs were set on both sides along the wall\nfrom the threshold through to the inmost chamber, and on them\nwere laid soft, fine-woven covers, the work of women,\nand here it was that the Phaiakian leaders would sit,\ndrinking and eating: unfailing abundance was theirs.\nYouths made of gold there were too, standing on solid\npedestals, who held blazing torches in their hands\nto light up the night for those at dinner in the great hall.\nAnd there were fifty house slaves there in the hall, women,\nof whom some were grinding yellow grain in a mill\nand others weaving on looms or twirling the distaff\nas they sat there like a tall aspen’s flickering leaves;\nand from the close-woven fabrics dripped the soft oil.\nFor just as Phaiakian men were skilled above all others\nat steering a swift ship over the deep, so too their women\nwere expert weavers: Athene had given them unsurpassed\nunderstanding of exquisite handiwork, and clever minds.\nOutside the courtyard, close to the doors, was a large\nfour-acre orchard, with a hedge in place all round it:\nthere fruit trees flourished, luxuriant and tall,\npears, pomegranates, ripe-fruited apple trees,\nsweet fig trees and abundantly fertile olives.\nThe produce of these never failed or perished, either\nin winter or summer, but lasted throughout the year:\nsome fruits the west wind’s breeze grew, others it ripened;\npear mellowed upon pear here, apple on apple,\ngrape cluster upon cluster, fig upon fig. There too\nwas rooted a vineyard, richly productive, of which\none part was a warm sun-trap on level ground for drying,\nwhile clusters elsewhere were being culled at vintage\nor trodden; and grapes still unripe, out in front, were either\nshedding their blossom or darkening to purple. There too,\nby the last row of vines, grew well-planned vegetable beds\nof every variety, bright green the whole year through;\nand there were two springs, one discharging its water over\nthe whole garden, the other rising by the courtyard threshold\ntoward the high house. From this the townsfolk drew their water.\nSuch were the gods’ fine gifts in Alkinoos’ domain.\nMuch-enduring godlike Odysseus stood there and gazed;\nBut when in his heart he’d marveled at everything, then\nhe quickly stepped over the threshold and into the building,\nwhere he found the Phaiakians’ leaders and counselors pouring\nlibations from their cups to Argos’ far-sighted slayer,\nto whom they would pour the last drink when thinking of bedtime.\nMuch-enduring godlike Odysseus went through the hall, concealed\nby the thick mist that Athene had earlier shed around him\ntill he came to where Arete was, and the king Alkinoos.\nAbout the knees of Arete, Odysseus now threw his arms,\nand then at once the divine mist lifted from him,\nand all in the hall fell silent at the sight of the man, and they\nstared at him in amazement as Odysseus made his appeal:\n“Arete, godlike Rhexenor’s daughter, after much hardship\nI come as a suppliant to your husband and your knees—\nand to those dining here—may the gods grant them plenty\nin this life, and may each of them bequeath to his children\nthe wealth in his halls, and all honors his people gave him!\nI beg you, give me an escort to get to my own country,\nand soon: I’ve long suffered much, far from my dear ones.”\nSo saying, down he sat at the hearth, among the ashes\nclose by the fire. They all were hushed and silent. At last\nthere spoke among them the elderly hero Echeneos,\na man who’d seen more years than any Phaiakian,\nwell skilled at speaking, well versed in ancient wisdom:\nhe with good intent now addressed the assembly, saying:\n“Alkinoos, this is not the best way, nor is it seemly, to let\na stranger sit on the ground, at the hearth among the ashes—\nbut people are holding back, awaiting your word! Come then,\nraise the stranger up, and give him a silver-studded\nchair to sit on, tell the heralds to mix more wine\nthat we may pour libations to Zeus, hurler of bolts,\nthe protector of sacrosanct suppliants! And also let\nthe housekeeper give this stranger dinner from her store.”\nWhen Alkinoos, princely in power, heard these words, he took\nthe wise, subtle-minded Odysseus by the hand, and raised him\nup from the hearth, and seated him on a shining chair—\nmaking his son get up, the kindly Laodamas,\nwho sat next to him, and was the one whom he loved best.\nA maid brought hand-washing water in a fine golden\npitcher, and poured it into a silver basin, so he\ncould wash, and drew up a polished table beside him.\nThe respected housekeeper brought and set out bread,\nwith many side dishes, giving freely of her supplies.\nMuch-enduring and godlike Odysseus drank and ate.\nThen Alkinoos, princely in power, said to the herald:\n“Pontonoos, mix a bowlful, serve wine to all in the hall,\nthat we may pour libations to Zeus, hurler of bolts,\nthe protector of sacrosanct suppliants!”\nSo he spoke,\nand Pontonoos came and mixed the mind-honeying wine\nand served it to all, with first drops for libation. But when\nthey’d made libation and drunk as much as the heart desired,\nAlkinoos then addressed them, speaking as follows:\n“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\nwhile I tell you what the heart in my breast dictates.\nNow that you’ve dined, go home and get your rest:\ntomorrow, early, we’ll summon more of the elders,\nwelcome this stranger here in our halls, and offer\nchoice sacrifice to the gods. Then we’ll further consider\nthe matter of his conveyance, how without toil or trouble,\ncarried by us, he’s to reach his native country—\nhowever far distant that may be—soon and rejoicing;\nnor on the way shall he suffer any harm or setback\nuntil he sets foot on his own land—although thereafter\nhe’ll suffer whatever his fate and the weighty Spinners have spun\nwith his birth-thread right from the moment his mother bore him!\nBut if he’s some kind of immortal, come down from heaven,\nthen this is a new gambit of the gods’ contriving, since\nalways till now they’ve appeared to us plainly manifest\nwhenever we offer them our most lavish sacrifices,\nand they feast among us, sitting where we sit ourselves.\nWhat’s more, if a solitary traveler should meet them on the road\nthey don’t use disguise, since we’re close kin to them,\nlike the Kyklopes or the wild tribes of the Giants.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Alkinoos, don’t let that bother you: I am not in any way\nlike the immortals who hold the broad heavens, either\nphysically or in nature: I look, and am, mortal, a man!\nWhoever you know of mankind that shoulder the heaviest load\nof grief, to them I might liken myself in my sorrows—\nand indeed I could tell a yet longer tale of all\nthe troubles I’ve endured by the will of the gods!\nBut first let me eat some dinner, grieving though I am:\nfor nothing exists more shameless than one’s loathsome belly,\nthat forces a man to take notice of it at need, however\ndistressed he may be and stricken by grief at heart,\nas I am grief-stricken at heart now; yet still unremittingly\nit commands me to eat and drink, forces me to forget\neverything I have suffered, insists on being refilled!\nBut will you please make haste, at daybreak’s first appearance,\nto set me, the ill-starred one, on the road to my own country\nafter all my troubles: let life leave me, once I’ve seen\nmy possessions, my servants, and my great high-roofed house.”\nSo he spoke: they all applauded and approved the dispatch\nof the stranger, since his request had been properly presented.\nWhen they’d made libation and drunk as much as the heart desired,\nthey went, each man to his home, to get their repose;\nand godlike Odysseus was left there in the hall\nwith Arete and godlike Alkinoos sitting beside him,\nwhile the maidservants cleared away the remains of dinner.\nThen white-armed Arete was the first to speak, for she\nhad recognized his mantle and tunic at first sight\nas fine clothes she herself and her serving women had made;\nso now she spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Stranger, this question I’ll ask first myself: Who are you,\nand from where? Who gave you these clothes? Did you not\nsay that you arrived here while wandering over the deep?”\nThen, responding to her, resourceful Odysseus declared:\n“It’s hard, my queen, to render an exhaustive account\nof my troubles: the heavenly gods have given me so many!\nBut this I will tell you, in response to your enquiry:\nThere’s an island, Ogygia, that lies far off in the deep,\nand the daughter of Atlas, crafty Kalypso, lives there,\na dread fair-tressed goddess; with her there’s no one else\nhas intercourse, be it of gods or of mortal humans,\nbut unfortunate that I am, some god brought me alone\nto her hearth, after Zeus struck my swift ship with a bright\nbolt, and destroyed it in the midst of the wine-dark deep.\nThere all the rest of my staunch companions perished,\nbut I clutched in my arms the keel of my curved vessel\nand was borne off for nine days: on the tenth dark night\nthe gods landed me on Ogygia, where Kalypso dwells—\nthat dread fair-tressed goddess! She welcomed me, took me in,\ngave me food, treated me kindly, said she would make me\nimmortal and ageless all my days; but she never\ncould persuade the heart in my breast. There I remained\nfor seven unbroken years, keeping ever damp with my tears\nthe immortal garments in which Kalypso clothed me.\nBut when in its cycle the eighth year arrived for me, then\nshe urged and told me to be on my way once more—\neither she’d had a message from Zeus or else her own mind\nhad changed—and sent me off on a well-bound raft, and gave me\nplenty of bread and sweet wine, with immortal clothes to wear,\nand raised a good tailwind for me, both mild and breezy.\nFor seventeen days then I sailed on over the deep,\nand on the eighteenth your country’s shadowy mountains\ncame into sight, and the heart within me rejoiced.\nBut I was out of luck: I still had plenty of trouble\nto live with, directed against me by Poseidon the Earth-Shaker,\nfor he raised up winds to confront me, delayed my journey\nby horribly roiling the sea, with waves that would not\nlet me sail on, even miserably, aboard my raft: the storm\nbroke it up! Nevertheless, I still somehow managed\nto swim my way through this great gulf of the sea, until\nwind and wave carried me to your coast. Had I attempted\nto land there, the waves would have hurled me upon the strand,\ndashed me against great rocks at this cheerless site;\nBut I kept well clear, and swam on, until I reached the river,\nand this seemed to me the best possible landing place,\nbeing smooth of rocks and offering shelter against the wind.\nOut then I stumbled, half dead, and ambrosial night\ncame on. I got clear of the heaven-fed river, lay down\nto sleep in the bushes, heaped up piles of leaves\naround me: some god shed over me limitless sleep.\nSo there in the leaves, much troubled at heart, I slumbered\nthe whole night through, and next morning until midday\nand later—the sun was declining when at last sweet sleep\nreleased me. Then I saw your daughter’s maids at play\non the shore, and herself among them, like a goddess.\nTo her I appealed: she knew what was proper behavior—\na virtue you’d not expect to find a young casually met\nperson displaying: the young are always so thoughtless!\nShe offered me food in abundance and sparkling wine\nand had me washed in the river and gave me these clothes.\nDistressed I may be, but everything I’ve told you is the truth.”\nThen Alkinoos made him this answer, saying: “Stranger,\nmy child did not behave correctly in one respect: she should\nhave brought you here to our home, along with her handmaids,\nsince she was the first to whom you made your supplication.”\nThen in answer to him resourceful Odysseus declared:\n“Hero, do not for this rebuke your blameless daughter!\nShe did indeed tell me to follow her with her handmaids,\nBut I would not, being scared and embarrassed, in case\nyou might be somehow offended by the sight; we’re all\nvery suspicious-minded, we breeds of men here on earth.”\nAlkinoos again responded to him, saying: “Stranger,\nthe heart in my breast is not the kind to become irate\nwithout good cause: due measure is always better.\nNo, I could wish—Zeus, Father, Athene, Apollo!—that you,\nbeing the kind of man you are, with a mind like my own,\nmight have my daughter, be known as my son-in-law,\nand be domiciled here: a house and property I’d give you\nwere you willing to stay! But against your will shall no\nPhaiakian detain you—never be that Zeus the Father’s wish!\nFor your convoy I set a day, that you may know it surely:\ntomorrow. Then you’ll lie down, overmastered by sleep,\nand they’ll row you over a calm sea until you arrive\nat your country and home—or whatever place you fancy,\neven if it’s somewhere far more distant than Euboia,\nthe most remote of lands—or so say those of our people\nwho saw it when they conveyed the fair-haired Rhadamanthys\nto go visit Tityos, son of Gaia. Thither they voyaged,\nwithout effort completed their journey, and came back\nhome that same day! So shall you too discover\nby how much my vessels are the best, and my young men\nat sweeping the salt sea with their oar blades.”\nSo he spoke.\nMuch-enduring godlike Odysseus, rejoicing, uttered\na personal prayer, in these words: “Zeus, Father, grant\nthat he, Alkinoos, may accomplish all he’s promised!\nSo shall his fame spread, unquenchable, over all\nthe grain-giving earth, and I get home to my own country!”\nSuch the words they exchanged in discussion with one another.\nWhite-armed Arete now instructed her handmaids\nto set up a bedstead down in the colonnade, and on it\nto spread fine purple blankets, with coverlets over them,\nand on top of these fleecy mantles to wear as wraps. The maids\nwent out of the hall with torches held in their hands,\nand after they’d finished draping the close-strung bedstead,\nthey came back to Odysseus, and addressed him, saying:\n“Stranger, up with you now, your bed is made and ready.”\nThus they spoke, and welcome he found it to lie down and rest.\nThere, then, he slept, much-enduring godlike Odysseus,\non the corded bedstead down in the echoing colonnade.\nBut Alkinoos took his repose in the high house’s inmost room,\nand beside him his lady wife now shared their bed and marriage.\n",

         "\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nAlkinoos, princely in power, arose from his slumber,\nand Odysseus, the Zeus-born sacker of cities, rose too.\nAlkinoos, princely in power, now led the way to\nthe Phaiakians’ assembly place, built for them near their ships:\nOn arrival there they sat down on the polished stones\nside by side, while Pallas Athene went through the city\nin the likeness of the herald of sagacious Alkinoos,\nworking on the return of great-hearted Odysseus. To each\nman she met she would say, as she stood beside him:\n“Come now, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\nattend the assembly, and hear all about the stranger\nwho’s recently come to the house of sagacious Alkinoos\nfrom being lost on the deep—in form he’s like the immortals!”\nSo saying she stirred up each man’s heart and spirit,\nand quickly the seats of assembly were all filled up\nby gathering men, many of whom now marveled\nat the sight of Laertes’ sagacious son, for Athene had shed\na wondrous grace over his head and shoulders, made him\nappear both taller and sturdier, so that he might\nbe welcome to all the Phaiakians, and inspire\nawe and respect, and accomplish the numerous feats\nin which the Phaiakians were to make trial of Odysseus.\nWhen they were all in place and gathered together,\nAlkinoos made a speech, addressed the assembly, saying:\n“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\nwhile I tell you what the heart in my breast dictates. This stranger—\nwho he is I don’t know—has wandered here to my house,\nwhether from men of the east or the west. He wants\nconveyance, and is begging us for assurance on that.\nSo let us, as in the past, provide him swift conveyance:\nfor no other man who’s appeared at my house has had to wait\nin misery overlong for the convoy that he needed!\nSo come, let’s haul a black ship down to the bright sea\nfor its maiden voyage; let those fifty-two young men,\nthe best crew in the district, be chosen to serve aboard it;\nand then, when each man has fastened his oar to its rowlock,\ndisembark, come up to my house, partake of a quick meal—\non me, I’ll make ample provision for everybody involved!\nThat’s my order to the young men. As for you others,\nyou sceptered princes, come on up to my beautiful dwelling,\nso we can entertain the stranger as guest in our halls,\nand let no man refuse me! Also fetch the divine minstrel,\nDemodokos: for to him the god’s granted an unmatched gift\nof song, to please, however his spirit may bid him sing.”\nThat said, he led the way, and the sceptered princes followed,\nwhile a herald went off to fetch the divine minstrel,\nand the chosen youths, two and fifty of them, obeyed\nhis orders, and made their way to the unharvested sea,\nand when they reached the ship and the sea, they hauled\nthe black vessel down to deep water, and in its black hull\nproceeded to step the mast, to set the sails, and secure\nthe oars to the leather straps of the rowlocks, all in due order.\nThis done, they spread the white sail, then anchored the vessel\nwell out in deep water. This done, they took themselves off\nto the great abode of sagacious Alkinoos. There they found\nall the courtyards and colonnades and chambers crowded\nwith the many guests that had gathered, both young and old.\nFor them Alkinoos slaughtered a dozen sheep and eight\nwhite-tusked boars and a couple of shambling oxen: these\nthey skinned and dressed, and made ready a delectable feast.\nNow the herald returned, bringing the trusty minstrel,\nwhom the Muse loved dearly, but gave him both good and ill:\nshe robbed him of eyesight, yet made him a sweet singer.\nThe herald Pontonoos set him a silver-studded chair\namid the feasters, leaned it against a tall pillar,\nhung the clear-toned lyre from a peg up over his head,\nand instructed him how to find it with his hands: so far\nthe herald. Beside him he placed a basket and fine table,\nalong with a cup of wine to drink from when so minded.\nNow they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them;\nbut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink\nthe Muse stirred the minstrel to sing of the famous deeds of men\nfrom that lay the fame of which had reached the wide heavens—\nthe quarrel between Odysseus and Peleus’ son, Achilles,\nhow once they contended at a sumptuous feast of the gods\nwith vehement words, and the king of men, Agamemnon,\nwas glad at heart that the best Achaians were in contention,\nfor thus Phoibos Apollo had told him, when giving a response\nin sacred Pytho, after he’d crossed the threshold of stone\nto enquire of the oracle: then it was that the start of trouble\ncame rolling on Trojans and Danaans on account of great Zeus’ plans.\nThis theme the famous minstrel chose. But Odysseus\ntook his great purple mantle in his powerful hands\nand pulled it down over his head, to hide his handsome face,\nashamed to be shedding tears before the Phaiakians.\nEvery time the divine minstrel had a pause in his singing\nOdysseus would wipe off the tears, lift the mantle from his head,\ntake a two-handled cup and pour a libation to the gods;\nbut when he began again—the Phaiakian nobles would urge him\nto sing more, for they took great pleasure in his lays—\nthen Odysseus would once more cover his head and sigh.\nHis weeping escaped the notice of all the others; only\nAlkinoos was aware of it and took notice, since he sat\nbeside him, and could hear his heavy sighing. At once\nhe addressed himself to the Phaiakians, oar-lovers all:\n“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians:\nby now we’ve slaked our desire for the shared banquet\nand the lyre that’s the accompaniment to ample feasting;\nnow let’s go out and make trial in every kind of athletic\ncontest, so that this stranger may tell his friends,\nwhen he gets back home, how far we outstrip other men\nin boxing and wrestling, in jumping and running.”\nThat said,\nhe led the way, and they followed him. On its peg\nthe herald hung up the clear-toned lyre, and took\nDemodokos by the hand, led him out of the hall\nand followed the same road just taken by the other\nPhaiakian nobles to watch the contests. They went\nto the place of assembly: a large throng accompanied them,\ncountless in number; there stood up many fine young men.\nUp got Akroneos, Okyalos and Elatreus,\nNauteus and Prymneus, Anchialos and Eretmeus,\nPonteus and Proreus, Thoon and Anabesineos,\nwith Amphialos, the son of Polyneos, Tekton’s son;\nup, too, Euryalos, peer of man-killing Ares,\nNaubolos’ son, the best in looks and stature—\nbar only peerless Laodamas—of all the Phaiakians;\nand up got the three sons of matchless Alkinoos:\nLaodamas, Halios, and godlike Klytoneos.\nThese then first made trial of themselves in the footrace:\nthe pace was hot from the start, they all raced together,\nspeedily kicking up the dust from the plain; but of them\npeerless Klytoneos proved by far the swiftest runner,\nand by the length of the furrow mules plow in fallow land\nhe got back first to the crowd, well ahead of all the rest.\nThen they competed in the painful art of wrestling,\nand here Euryalos outdid all the best competitors;\nat jumping Amphialos had no rivals in the field,\nwhile with the discus Elatreus was an easy winner,\nand at boxing Laodamas, Alkinoos’ splendid son.\nBut after they’d all enjoyed these athletic contests,\nLaodamas, Alkinoos’ son, had this to say to them:\n“Come, friends, let us ask the stranger if there’s any contest\nthat he knows and has practiced. In build he’s not a weakling—\nlook at his thighs and calves, both arms above them,\nhis sturdy neck: great strength there! He’s not lacking\nin manly vigor, but just broken by many misfortunes:\nfor to my mind there’s nothing worse than the sea\nto break down a man, even though he be the strongest.”\nThen Euryalos in turn responded to him, saying:\n“Laodamas, what you propose is rightly spoken!\nGo challenge him now yourself, tell him what you told us.”\nWhen Alkinoos’ good son heard this, he went and stood\nin the midst, and addressed Odysseus as follows, saying:\n“Come on, stranger, father: you too should try these contests\nif haply you’re skilled in any: and it’s likely that you are\nso skilled, for a man’s life can show no greater glory\nthan what he achieves with his own hands and feet.\nSo come, make trial of yourself, scatter care from your heart!\nYour journey won’t long be delayed now, already your ship\nis hauled down and launched, your companions all are ready.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Laodamas, why do you make me this mocking challenge?\nMy mind is far fuller of sorrows than of contests:\nBefore now I have suffered much, endured much hardship;\nnow here in your assembly I sit, and seek my homecoming,\nmaking my plea to your king and to his people as a whole.”\nEuryalos then replied, taunting him to his face:\n“No, indeed, stranger, you don’t look to me like a man\nfamiliar with contests, such as mankind has in plenty;\nyou’re more the sort that goes to and fro with his many-\noared vessel, a captain of sailors who also are traders,\ntaking care of his freight, an overseer of cargo\nand gain got by greed. You don’t look to me like an athlete.”\nWith an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded:\n“Sir, that was not well said; you sound like some reckless\nbadmouth! It’s true that the gods don’t hand out gracious\ngifts to all men, of either looks, or wit, or eloquence: one man\nwill make a less impressive appearance, and yet\nthe god crowns his speech with grace, people regard him\nwith admiring pleasure, his utterances are sure,\nrespectful and honey-sweet: he stands out in a crowd,\nand as he goes through the city, men look on him as a god.\nAnother may be as handsome as the immortals, but\nno crown of grace will be set on his public speaking—\nand so with you: your looks are outstanding, not even\na god could improve them, but in mind you’re inadequate.\nYou’ve provoked the heart in my breast by your mannerless\nmode of address: I’m no novice at sporting contests\nas you assert—no, I reckon I ranked among the first\nwhile I could safely trust in my vigor and my hands;\nbut now trouble and grief possess me: much I’ve endured,\ncutting my path through men’s wars and the damaging waves.\nYet despite my great suffering I’ll make trial of your contests,\nfor your words gnaw at my heart, what you said drives me on.”\nSo saying, he sprang up, still in his mantle, and seized\na stone quoit—one bigger, thicker, and weightier by far\nthan those the Phaiakians used to compete against each other.\nThis he whirled about and let fly from his mighty hand,\nand the stone whirred: down they crouched on the ground,\ndid the long-oared Phaiakians, men famous for their ships,\nbeneath the stone’s flight. Past the marks of all it flew,\nfast sped from his hand, and Athene—in the likeness of a man—\nchecked the length of the cast, and then addressed him, saying:\n“Even a blind man, stranger, could distinguish this cast of yours\nby feeling for it: it’s not mixed up with the rest but well\nahead of them all. This contest at least should encourage you—\nNo Phaiakian will equal your cast, much less get past it.”\nSo she spoke. Much-enduring godlike Odysseus rejoiced,\nglad to have met with a friendly supporter at these contests.\nThen, in a lighter mood, he spoke among the Phaiakians:\n“Match that cast now, young men! I’ll soon let fly another,\nits equal in length, or maybe an even longer shot!\nAs for the rest of you, if anyone’s heart and spirit\nso bids him, come on, let him try me, since you’ve got me angry—\nboxing, wrestling, or running, I don’t care which,\nany Phaiakian, except for Laodamas in person,\nhe being my host: who’d fight the one that befriended him?\nWitless the man and worthless that would ever challenge\nto a contest the host who gave him a kindly welcome\nin some foreign country: he’d cut all his own hopes short!\nBut of the rest there’s none I either refuse or slight:\nI want to learn their strength, to test myself against them.\nFor I’m no slouch all round in the contests that men practice—\nwell do I know how to handle a polished bow,\nand always I’d be the first to shoot and hit my man\nin the thick of the enemy, though many of my comrades\nwere standing beside me, loosing off arrows at the foe.\nPhiloktetes alone it was who excelled me at archery\nin the land of the Trojans, when we Achaians were shooting!\nOf the rest I can claim to be the best by far\nof all mortals that now eat bread upon this earth,\nthough I have no wish to compete with those of former times,\nwith Herakles or Oichalian Eurytos, such men\nas competed in marksmanship even with the immortals.\nFor that was why great Eurytos died young, why no old age\ncaught up with him in his halls: Apollo, furious, slew him\nbecause he’d challenged the god to an archery contest. What’s more,\nI can throw a spear further than any man can shoot an arrow!\nIn the footrace alone I fear I may be outrun by some\nPhaiakian: I’ve been harshly battered by countless waves,\nand aboard my ship I had no long-term care for my body,\nwhich is why my limbs are now very badly out of trim.”\nSo he spoke, and they all remained hushed in silence. Only\nAlkinoos made him an answer, addressed him saying:\n“Stranger, your words here among us were not ungracious,\nbut due to your wish to make clear your innate prowess—\nbeing angered, because that man confronted you in this contest\nand mocked you, in a way no mortal who was aware\nof how to speak fittingly would disparage your prowess.\nSo come now, give heed to my words, that you may tell them\nto some other hero, when in your own great hall\nyou’re feasting, together with your wife and children,\nand recall our feats, the achievements that to us too\nZeus has constantly granted since the days of our fathers.\nNow we’re not unmatched as boxers, or as wrestlers, but in\nthe footrace we run swiftly; we’re the best of seamen,\nand dear to us always are feasting, and dancing, and the lyre,\nand changes of clothes, hot baths, and bed. So come,\nall you Phaiakians who are our finest dancers,\nfoot it gaily, so that the stranger may report to his friends,\nafter getting back home, how far we surpass all others\nin seamanship, fleetness of foot, and dancing and singing!\nAnd let someone go at once and fetch for Demodokos\nthe clear-toned lyre that’s lying somewhere in our halls.”\nSo spoke godlike Alkinoos, and the herald got up\nto go fetch the hollow lyre from the king’s domain.\nThen nine umpires arose, all chosen by popular vote,\nwhose job was to regulate every detail of the games.\nThey leveled a dancing floor, cleared a fine open space,\nand the herald approached, bringing the clear-toned lyre\nfor Demodokos, who then went to the middle, and round him\nstood young men in youth’s first bloom, well skilled at dancing,\nand performed the steps of the sacred dance. Odysseus,\nmarveling, watched the flash of their feet as they moved.\nDemodokos now struck his lyre to introduce the fine lay\nabout Ares’ love for sweet-garlanded Aphrodite—\nhow they first lay together in the house of Hephaistos,\nsecretly, how he showered her with gifts, shamed the marital\nbed of the lord Hephaistos, to whom Helios promptly came\nwith the news that he’d seen them making love. And when\nHephaistos heard his heart-rending tattle, he went\noff to his smithy, secretly planning revenge,\nand set on its block the great anvil, and hammered out bonds\nunbreakable and unloosable, made to hold fast when set;\nthen, having fashioned this snare in his fury against Ares,\nhe went to the chamber where his own dear bedstead stood\nand circled the bonds round the bedposts from every angle:\nmany he hung overhead, attached to the rafters, as fine\nas spiders’ webs, so that none could see them, not even\none of the blessed gods, so craftily were they fashioned.\nThen, when he’d placed his snares all around the bed, he made\nas though he was going to Lemnos, that well-built citadel,\nof all lands on earth to him by far the dearest. And no\nblind watch did golden-reined Ares keep, but when\nhe saw the famed craftsman Hephaistos departing, he went\nstraight off to the house of the same famous Hephaistos,\nhis mind imagining sex with sweet-garlanded Kythereia.\nNow she from a spell with her father, the mighty son of Kronos,\nhad just arrived, and sat down: Ares entered the house\nand took her by the hand, and addressed her, saying:\n“Come, my love, let’s to bed and its pleasures: for no longer\nis Hephaistos around here, but I think is on his way\nto Lemnos, off there visiting the rough-spoken Sintians.”\nSuch his words, and she welcomed the prospect of bedding him.\nThey went to bed and lay down. But the crafty bonds devised\nby artful Hephaistos immobilized them: they were unable\nto move their limbs, let alone get up. Then they knew the truth,\nthat for them no longer was there any chance of escape.\nSo the far-famed double cripple came home and found them,\nhaving turned back before he reached the land of Lemnos,\nsince Helios kept watch for him, brought him the news.\nHe went to his house now, deeply troubled at heart,\nand stood there in the forecourt, gripped by a wild fury,\nand with a terrible shout cried out to all the gods:\n“Zeus! Father! All you other blessed immortal gods!\nCome see a sight both ridiculous and unseemly—\nthe way because I’m lame Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite\ndishonors me constantly by loving destructive Ares\nbecause he’s strong-limbed and handsome, whereas I\nwas born misshapen, for which there’s no one to blame\nbut my two parents—would they’d never had me! Now you\nshall see for yourselves the way they go to make love\nin my own bed, to me a grievous sight—yet somehow\nI don’t imagine they’ll want to lie thus a minute longer\nhowever much they’re in love: they’ll soon lose the urge\nfor sleep—rather those crafty bonds will hold them tight\nuntil her father pays back to me every single bride-gift\nI lavished on him in return for his bitch of a daughter,\nsince the daughter’s beautiful, but lacking in self-restraint.”\nSo he spoke, and the gods came crowding to his bronze-floored\nhouse: Poseidon, the Earth-Embracer, along with Hermes,\nthe helper, and Lord Apollo, the deadly archer; but\nthe female deities stayed, every one, at home for shame.\nSo there they stood in the doorway: gods, givers of good things,\nand laughter unquenchable rose among the blessed gods\nas they gazed at the crafty work of ingenious Hephaistos,\nand thus would one of them say, with a glance at his neighbor:\n“Ill deeds don’t thrive! The slow catches the swift,\njust as now Hephaistos the laggard has caught Ares,\nthough of the gods holding Olympos he’s the swiftest;\nthough lame, he caught him by guile. Now Ares must pay\nthe adulterer’s fine.” So they spoke to one another.\nBut to Hermes the lord Apollo, the son of Zeus, now said:\n“Hermes, Zeus’ son, guide, giver of good things, would you\nbe ready, even if hard-pressed by such powerful bonds,\nto sleep in a bed at the side of golden Aphrodite?”\nThen the guide, the slayer of Argos, answered him: “How I wish,\nLord Apollo, deadly archer, that this might come to pass—\nwith three times as many unshakable bonds set round me,\nand you gods, with all the goddesses too, looking on—\nthat I might sleep at the side of golden Aphrodite!”\nAt his words laughter arose among the immortal gods.\nPoseidon, though, was not laughing, but kept entreating\nHephaistos, the far-famed craftsman, to set Ares free:\nhe spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Free him,\nand I promise on his behalf, as you require, that he will\npay the full proper sum before the immortal gods.”\nThen the far-famed double cripple answered him thus:\n“Do not demand this of me, Poseidon, Earth-Embracer:\na pledge made on behalf of the worthless is a worthless pledge!\nAnd how could I constrain you among the immortal gods\nwere Ares to dodge both debt and bond and just vanish?”\nThen Poseidon the Earth-Shaker responded to him, saying:\n“Hephaistos, even were Ares to renege on the debt he owes\nand take off in flight, I myself will pay the total sum.”\nThe far-famed double cripple responded to this, saying:\n“I cannot refuse your offer: that would not be seemly.”\nSo saying, the mighty Hephaistos unlocked the snares,\nand the two, once freed from the snares, despite their strength,\nsprang up at once: he, Ares, now took himself off to Thrace,\nwhile she, smiling Aphrodite, left for Paphos on Cyprus,\nwhere she had her sacred precinct and fragrant altar.\nThere the Graces bathed her, anointed her with ambrosial\noil, such as soothes the skin of the gods who are forever,\nand clothed her in elegant raiment, a wonder to behold.\nThis was the lay the famed minstrel sang; and Odysseus\nlistened with great enjoyment, as did the others,\nthe long-oared Phaiakians, men famous for their ships.\nThen Alkinoos had Halios and Laodamas dance—\nalone, since no one else could match their performance.\nThey took in their hands an exquisite purple ball,\nthat the skilled artist Polybos had fashioned for them,\nand one would toss it high to the shadowy clouds,\nleaning back, while the other would leap high off the ground\nand easily catch it before his feet touched earth again.\nBut when they’d tested their skill at throwing the ball\nstraight up, then they danced upon the grain-giving earth,\nquickly tossing the ball to and fro, while the other youths\nstood beating time, and a din of stamping feet arose.\nThen godlike Odysseus addressed Alkinoos, saying:\n“Alkinoos, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\nyou claimed that these your dancers were unrivaled,\nand they’ve proved it true: I’m awed by the sight of them.”\nSo he spoke, and Alkinoos, princely in power, rejoiced,\nand at once addressed the oar-loving Phaiakians, saying:\n“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians:\nthis stranger seems to me a man of the highest discretion!\nCome then, let’s give him a guest-gift, as is befitting:\ntwelve renowned princes hold sway in this our country\nas rulers, and I myself am the thirteenth: let each\none of the twelve now bring him a fresh-washed mantle\nand tunic, as well as a talent of precious gold,\nand let’s collect all this now, so that the stranger\nmay go happy to supper, holding our gifts in his hands—\nand let Euryalos make amends to him in person,\nwith words and a gift: what he said was most unfitting.”\nSo he spoke: they all approved, and endorsed the offer,\nand each sent off a herald to fetch the gifts,\nand Euryalos in his turn now responded, saying:\n“Alkinoos, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\nI shall indeed makes amends to the stranger, as you bid me.\nI’ll give him this all-bronze sword, which possesses a hilt\nof silver, and a scabbard of fresh-sawn ivory\nencases it. It will be of great value to him.”\nThat said,\nto Odysseus he handed over the silver-studded sword,\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “Greetings, father,\nstranger: if any word that’s been uttered was improper,\nmay storm winds now snatch it up and carry it off! And may\nthe gods grant you see your wife, reach your own country:\nToo long you’ve endured hardship far from your dear ones.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Greetings to you too, friend! May the gods enrich you,\nand may you never hereafter be seized by longing for\nthis sword you’ve given me—with a handsome apology.”\nThat said, he hung from his shoulders the silver-studded sword,\nand the sun went down, and the glorious gifts appeared.\nNoble heralds now bore them to Alkinoos’ abode,\nwhere the sons of peerless Alkinoos took charge of these\nexquisite presents, and set them before their revered\nmother. Alkinoos, princely in power, led them,\nand in they came and sat down on the high-backed chairs.\nThen mighty Alkinoos addressed himself to Arete:\n“My wife, bring a fine chest here, the best we have,\nand in it put a fresh-laundered mantle and a tunic,\nand set a bronze cauldron to warm on the fire, heat water in it,\nso that when the stranger has bathed and had a good look\nat all the gifts the peerless Phaiakians brought here,\nhe may then enjoy the feast, and the minstrel’s singing;\nand I shall make him a present of this fine golden\ncup of mine, that he may remember me all his days\nwhen he pours in his hall libations to Zeus and the other gods.”\nSo he spoke; and Arete gave orders to her handmaids\nto set over the fire a great cauldron as quickly as they could.\nThey settled the bathwater cauldron on the blazing flames\nand filled it with water and under it kindled firewood.\nFlames lapped the cauldron’s belly, the water grew hot,\nwhile Arete fetched for the stranger an exquisite chest\nfrom her storeroom, and in it placed the beautiful gifts—\nthe clothes, the gold—that the Phaiakians provided,\ntogether with a mantle and fine tunic that she put in\nherself, then addressed Odysseus with winged words, saying:\n“Take care of the lid yourself, put a quick knot on it,\nlest someone rob you during your homeward journey,\nwhile you’re traveling, sweetly asleep, aboard that black ship.”\nWhen much-enduring godlike Odysseus heard those words\nhe at once fitted the lid on, and quickly secured it with\na complex knot he’d once learned from the lady Kirke.\nThen promptly the housekeeper called him to go and be scrubbed\nin the bathtub, and he rejoiced in his heart on seeing\nthe warm bath, since such care had been far from frequent\never since he’d left the home of fair-tressed Kalypso,\nthough till then he’d been cared for continually like a god.\nSo when the handmaids had bathed him, rubbed him with oil,\nthey dressed him in a splendid mantle and tunic, and he\nstepped away from the bathtub and went to join the men\nat their wine. And Nausikaa, whose beauty was from the gods,\nstood by the pillar supporting the close-packed roof,\nand marveled at Odysseus as she took in his appearance,\nand spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Farewell, stranger: even when you’re back in your own country\nremember me: I was the first to whom you owed your life.”\nIn answer to her resourceful Odysseus then said:\n“Nausikaa, daughter of great-hearted Alkinoos,\nso now may Zeus, Here’s loud-thundering husband,\nlet me return to see the day of my homecoming!\nThere too I’ll pray to you as I would to a god\nall the days of my life: for you saved my life, my dear.”\nWith that he sat down on the chair beside King Alkinoos.\nBy now they were serving out portions and mixing the wine,\nand the herald came in leading the trusty minstrel\nDemodokos, much honored by the people, set his chair\nin the midst of the diners, backed against a high pillar.\nThen resourceful Odysseus addressed himself to the herald\nas he cut off a piece of the chine—more still was left—\nfrom a white-tusked boar, with rich fat on either side:\n“Here, herald, take this cut and give it to eat\nto Demodokos: I salute him, despite my grief:\nfor among all men worldwide minstrels receive their share\nof honor and reverence, since the Muse has taught them\nthe ways of song, and has love for the whole tribe of singers.”\nSo he spoke: the herald took it and placed it in the hands\nof the hero Demodokos. He accepted it with pleasure.\nNow they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them;\nbut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nthen resourceful Odysseus addressed Demodokos, saying:\n“Demodokos, higher than all mortal men I praise you,\nwhether it was the Muse, Zeus’ daughter, or Apollo\nthat taught you, for you sing truly of the Achaians’ fate—\nall that they did and suffered, every hardship they endured,\nas though you’d been there yourself, or were told by one who had!\nBut change your theme now, and tell us about the Horse,\nthe Wooden Horse that Epeios made with Athene’s help,\nand Odysseus led up to the citadel, a deceptive trap,\nafter filling it with the men who sacked Ilion. If indeed\nyou perform this lay in right fashion, then I’ll declare,\nto all mankind, that the god, with a propitious heart,\nhas bestowed upon you the gift of divine song.”\nSo he spoke.\nSetting out from the god, the other began to narrate the tale,\nfrom when the Argives embarked on their well-benched ships\nand sailed away, after setting fire to the huts,\nwhile those led by far-famed Odysseus were already sitting\nin the Trojan place of assembly, concealed in the Horse.\nThe Trojans themselves had hauled it into the citadel, and\nwith it standing there they made many indecisive speeches\nsitting around it. Three proposals found supporters:\nto cut through its hollow timbers with the pitiless bronze,\nto drag it up to the summit and push it over the edge,\nor leave it as a great offering to propitiate the gods—\nwhich in the event, was what was destined to happen,\nfor it was their fate to perish when the city enfolded\nthat great horse of wood, in which sat all the best\nof the Argives, bringing the Trojans massacre and death.\nHow the Achaians’ sons then sacked the city he sang,\nas they poured from the horse, leaving their hollow ambush;\nhow they variously laid the steep city waste as they fought\nthrough it: how Odysseus, like Ares, together with godlike\nMenelaos pressed on to the house of Deiphobos. There\nit was, he said, that he dared his most terrible battle,\nand won in the end through the aid of great-hearted Athene.\nThis was the lay the far-famed minstrel sang. But Odysseus\nmelted: tears from under his eyelids wet his cheeks.\nAnd as a woman wails and clings to her dear husband\nwho’s fallen fighting to save his city and his people,\nwarding off from township and children the pitiless day,\nand she sees him dying and gasping for breath, collapses\non him, shrieking aloud, while enemies behind her\nbatter her back and shoulders with their spears,\nand drag her away into slavery, to a life of toil and grief,\nwhile with most pitiful sorrow her cheeks are wasted—\nsuch pitiful tears Odysseus now shed beneath his brows.\nHis weeping escaped the notice of all the others; only\nAlkinoos was aware of it and took notice, since he sat\nbeside him, and could hear his heavy sighing. At once\nhe addressed himself to the Phaiakians, oar-lovers all:\n“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\nand let Demodokos silence his clear-toned lyre,\nfor the lay he’s singing does not please every listener.\nSince we began our feast, and the divine singer arose,\nhe’s never—I mean the stranger—ceased from heartfelt\nlamentation: some great grief must have assailed his mind!\nThen let the minstrel stop, so we all can enjoy ourselves,\nboth hosts and guest: this is much the better way, since\nit’s for our respected guest all this has been laid on:\nhis conveyance, the kindly gifts we’ve given him as friends.\nDear as a brother the stranger and suppliant is regarded\nby any man whose wits have the slightest grasp of wisdom.\nDo not, therefore, stranger, hide behind deceptive phrasing\nthe true answers to what I shall ask you: best to speak plainly.\nTell me the name by which your mother and father\ncalled you back there, and the others in your town and district,\nfor there’s none of mankind is wholly without a name,\nneither common nor noble, from the time he was born,\nbut at their birth their parents fasten names on them all.\nAnd tell me your country, your district and your city,\nthat our ships may convey you thither, steering by their wits—\nfor among the Phaiakians there exist no steersmen,\nnor indeed steering oars, such as other vessels possess;\nthe ships themselves understand men’s purposes and minds,\nand know all the cities of men, their fertile plowland,\nand the gulf of the salt deep they traverse most speedily,\nhidden in mist and cloud; nor do they ever have\nthe slightest fear of encountering damage or shipwreck.\nYet once I heard a story related by my father,\nNausithoos: he used to say that Poseidon was angry\nwith us, because we give safe convoy to all and sundry.\nOne day, he said, a most beautiful Phaiakian vessel\nreturning from escort duty out on the misty deep,\nhe’d smite, and hide our city with a great mountain round it.\nSo said the old man; the god will either fulfill this\nor leave it unfulfilled, as the fancy takes him. But come,\ntell me this, and give me a true account of it: where\nhave your wanderings taken you, to what countries\nof men have you come, their people, their populous cities,\nwhether rough and wild and uncivilized, or those\nthat welcome strangers, and have god-fearing minds !\nAnd tell me what makes you weep and lament at heart\nas you hear the fate of the Danaan Argives, of Ilion:\nthis the gods fashioned, and spun the thread of destruction\nfor mankind, that there might be a song for those yet to come.\nDid some kinsman of yours, perhaps, lose his life before Ilion?\nSome fine warrior, wife’s father or son-in-law, those\nwho are closest to you after your own flesh and blood? Or was it\na comrade maybe, one especially dear to you,\nthis fine warrior? For in no way less than a brother\nis he who’s a comrade and whose mind embraces wisdom.”\n",

         "\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Alkinoos, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\nit is indeed a good thing to listen to such a minstrel\nas this man is, who resembles the gods in his singing!\nThere is, I’d say, no greater fulfillment of pleasure\nthan when all the people share a common enjoyment,\nand those feasting in the halls are listening to a minstrel\nas they sit there in order, and all the tables are loaded\nwith bread and meat, and the cupbearer draws off wine\nfrom the bowl, and pours it into the cups. Indeed,\nto me this seems the very best kind of occasion.\nBut your spirit has moved you to ask about my unhappy\ntroubles, that I may weep and sigh still further.\nWhat then shall I tell you first, what later? The heavenly\ngods have laid on me sorrows past counting. First,\nnow, I’ll tell you my name, that you all may know it,\nand afterwards, if I escape the pitiless day, I may\nin turn be your host, far off though I make my home.\nI am Odysseus, Laertes’ son, well known to all mankind\nfor my crafty devices: my fame goes up to heaven.\nMy home is in sunny Ithake: there’s a mountain on it,\na landmark, Neriton, leaf-clad; and around it are many\nislands, set close each one to its next neighbor—\nDoulichion, Same, and forested Zakynthos.\nIthake itself lies low in the sea, furthest out toward\nnight, but the rest are apart, nearer dawn and sunrise.\nIt’s rough land, but fine for raising young men. Myself,\nI can’t think of a sweeter sight than one’s own country.\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, kept me with her, it’s true,\nin her hollow caves, wanting me for her husband;\nand Kirke likewise detained me in her halls,\nthat wily Aiaian lady, wanting me for her husband;\nbut neither could ever persuade the heart in my breast—\nso sure as nothing’s sweeter than a man’s own country\nand forebears, though he may live far away in a rich home\nin some foreign land, and quite remote from his parents.\n“But come, let me tell you now of the grief-laden homecoming\nthat Zeus afflicted me with on my way back home from Troy.\nFrom Ilion the wind drove me, brought me to the Kikones,\nto Ismaros. There I sacked the city, slaughtered the men.\nFrom the city we took both the wives and a heap of goods\nand divided them. I made sure none got less than a fair share.\nThen I was all for us light-footing it out of there,\nand so urged; but the rest, the great fools, refused to listen.\nThen much wine was drunk, and many a sheep they slew\nalong the shore, many crumple-horned shambling steers.\nThe Kikones meanwhile had gone and appealed to other Kikones,\ntheir neighbors—more numerous, and more courageous too,\nwho dwelt on the mainland, and knew all about fighting\nfrom chariots as well as, where necessary, on foot.\nThey came now, as thick as leaves and flowers in season,\nat dawn: then indeed an ill fate from Zeus beset us,\nout of luck as we were, brought us a mass of troubles.\nBy the swift ships they stood and fought: each side\nattacked the other with their bronze-tipped spears.\nWhile it was morning still, while the sacred day increased,\nwe stood firm and held them off, despite their numbers;\nbut once the sun had reached the hour for unyoking oxen,\nthen the Kikones broke the Achaians and overwhelmed them,\nand six of our well-greaved comrades from each ship\ndied, but the rest of us dodged death and destiny. So\nwe sailed on from there, lamenting at heart, but glad\nat having got clear of death, though we’d lost our comrades.\nNor did I let our curved ships proceed any further\nuntil we’d all called out three times to each of our luckless\ncomrades who’d died on the plain, cut down by the Kikones.\nYet against our ships cloud-gathering Zeus still roused\nthe north wind, with an awesome tempest, and hid\nboth land and deep sea behind clouds: night sprang from heaven.\nOur ships were driven on sidelong, fragments—three, four—\nwere ripped from the sails by the violence of the wind.\nSo, scared of destruction, we lowered them to the deck,\nand rowed our way hastily landward. There for two\nnights and two days continuously we lay to,\neating our hearts out with sorrow and sheer exhaustion;\nbut when fair-haired Dawn brought on the third day, then\nwe stepped the masts, hoisted the white sails, and took\nour seats: the wind and the helmsmen steered our vessels.\nAnd then unscathed I would have come back to my own country;\nbut as I was rounding Cape Malea the waves and the current\nand the north wind drove me off course, sent me past Kythera.\nFor the next nine days I was borne on by deadly winds\nover the fish-rich sea; on the tenth I set foot\non the land of the Lotus-Eaters, who feed off a flowery food.\nHere we went ashore and replenished our store of water,\nand my comrades now had a meal, there by the swift ships.\nBut when we’d gotten our fill of food and drink,\nthen I sent out some comrades to go ahead and discover\nwhat kind of people, among earth’s bread-eaters, dwelt here—\ntwo men I chose, and a third to go with them as herald.\nThey went straight off, and soon found the Lotus-Eaters;\nand these Lotus-Eaters, far from wanting to kill\nour comrades, offered them lotus to eat. Now none\nwho consumed the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus any longer\nhad the urge to bring news back or continue the voyage,\nbut were set upon staying right there, with the Lotus-Eaters,\nmunching lotus, their homecoming all forgotten.\nThese men I myself dragged weeping back to the ships,\nand tied them up below deck in the hollow vessels,\nand ordered all the rest of my trusty companions\nto board the swift ships without delay, lest any\nby eating the lotus should forget their homecoming.\nSo they quickly embarked, and, seating themselves at the rowlocks,\nranged in good order, struck the grey brine with their oars.\n“From there we sailed on further, grieving at heart, until\nwe reached the Kyklopes’ country—an arrogant, lawless\npeople who, relying upon the immortal gods,\nwith their own hands plant nothing, nor do they plow;\nbut everything flourishes for them, unplowed, unsown:\nwheat and barley, and vines that bear rich clusters\nof grapes; and the rain of Zeus makes them grow. They have\nneither assemblies for counsel nor established customs,\nbut make their homes near the summits of high mountains\nin hollow caves, and each man lays down the law\nto his children and wives: they care nothing for one another.\n“A fertile island’s spread out there, beyond the harbor,\nneither near the Kyklopes’ land, nor yet remote from it,\nwell wooded: on it countless wild goats flourish,\nfor no human comings and goings get in their way,\nnor do hunters disturb them, men who have it rough\ntracking game in the woodland over the mountain tops;\nnor is it grazed on by flocks or put under the plow,\nbut unsown and unplowed all its days it stays bereft\nof humankind, supports nothing but bleating goats.\nFor the Kyklopes have no vermilion-cheeked vessels,\nnor in their land are there shipwrights, who might build them\nwell-benched ships that could answer all their needs,\ntake them to other men’s countries (as often enough\nmen traverse the sea in ships to call upon one another)—\nmen who could also develop the island for them,\nfor it’s far from poor and could grow every crop in season:\non it are meadows, beyond the banks of the salt-grey sea,\nsoft and well watered: vines would never lack moisture,\nthe earth’s good for plowing, they could reap deep-standing\nharvests in season, so rich is the subsoil. Here too\nis a good safe harbor, with no need of moorings, either\nanchor stones to throw out or stern warps to secure:\none can just beach one’s vessel and wait till the crew are minded\nto put to sea, and get a soft following wind.\nAt the head of the harbor there’s bright water flowing,\na spring from under a cave, with poplars growing round it.\nThere we sailed in, and some god gave us guidance\nthrough the murky night, for there was no light to see by:\na deep mist lay round the ships, nor did the moon\nshed any light from heaven, but was obscured by clouds.\nNone got a glimpse of that island, nor could we see\nthe long breakers rolling in on the shore, until\nwe beached all our well-benched vessels, and, that done,\nlowered the sails on each one of them, and ourselves\nthen disembarked on the seashore, and lay down\nto sleep, and awaited the coming of dawn and brightness.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nwe went exploring the island, in amazement at it,\nand the nymphs, the daughters of aegis-bearing Zeus,\nsent out the mountain goats, to give my comrades dinner.\nAt once we took from the ships curved bows and long-socketed\ngoat-spears, and forming ourselves into three groups\nwent hunting, and right off some god provided us\nwith a most satisfactory bag. Twelve ships came with me,\nand each got nine goats by lot; for me alone they chose ten.\n“So then for the rest of the day until the sun went down\nwe sat eating abundant meat and drinking the sweet wine,\nfor not yet was all the red wine in our ships consumed,\nbut some remained; each crew had drawn off a great deal\nin jars, when we sacked the Kikones’ sacred citadel.\nNow we were looking across at the nearby Kyklopes’ country—\nsaw smoke, heard their voices, the bleat of their sheep and goats.\nBut when the sun had set and darkness came on,\nthen we lay down and slept along the line of the shore.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nI called an assembly and declared before them all:\n‘The rest of you stay here now, my trusty comrades:\nI with my own ship and my own crew will go over\nand find out about these men—who they may be,\nwhether they’re violent creatures, savage, and lawless,\nor hospitable people, men with god-fearing minds.’\n“That said, I boarded my vessel, ordered my companions\nto embark themselves, and to cast off the stern warps.\nThey came aboard quickly, seated themselves at the rowlocks,\nand sitting in order struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\nBut when we got to the place, quite near at hand, there at\nthe land’s edge, close to the sea, we saw a cave,\nhigh, overgrown with laurels, where abundant flocks\nof sheep and goats spent the night. Around it a high\nwall had been built, with stones sunk deep in the ground,\nand long timbers of pine and lofty-crested oak.\nThere a monstrous man had his dwelling, who all alone\nherded his flocks far off, consorted with no others,\nbut lived by himself, mind bred in lawlessness:\na monstrous wonder, resembling not so much\nany bread-eating mortal, but rather the wooded peak\nof some lofty mountain, standing out apart from the rest.\n“Then I ordered the rest of my trusty comrades to stay there,\nwhere they were, by the ship, and to stand guard over it;\nbut I, having chosen the twelve best among my comrades,\nwent on, taking a goatskin full of the sweet dark wine\nthat Maro gave me—Maro, Euanthes’ son and priest\nof Apollo, the guardian of Ismaros—because we had\nprotected him, together with his wife and his child,\nout of reverence: his dwelling was in a wooded grove\nof Phoibos Apollo, and he gave me splendid gifts:\nof fine-wrought gold he bestowed on me seven talents,\nwith a mixing bowl all of silver, besides the wine,\nwith which he filled a dozen large jars in all,\nsweet and unmixed, a heavenly drink: not one\nof his house servants or handmaids had knowledge of it,\nonly himself, and his wife, and one woman, their housekeeper;\nand whenever they drank this honey-sweet red wine\nhe’d mix one cup of wine with twenty measures of water,\nand from the bowl would rise an aroma of marvelous\nsweetness—then indeed to abstain would be no pleasure!\nWith this wine I filled and took with me a sizable goatskin,\nand a leather bag packed with food, for my sharp mind sensed\nthat the man we were going to encounter, clad in huge strength,\nwas wild, with no knowledge of justice or civil rights.\n“So we quickly came to the cave, but did not find him\ninside: he was out, tending his fat flocks at pasture.\nThen we entered the cave, amazed by all we saw there:\nbaskets loaded with cheeses, pens full of lambs\nand kids. Each age-group was sorted out separately—\nthe older ones by themselves, the middlers likewise,\nthe newborn too. All the pans were brimming with whey,\nthe buckets and bowls, well wrought, that he used for milking.\nRight off, my comrades spoke up, implored me to take\nsome of the cheeses and leave, then quickly to drive\nkids and lambs from the pens back to our swift ship,\nand sail away over the deep salt sea. But I would not\nlisten—far better indeed had I done so!—for I wanted\nto meet this man, find out if he’d treat me as a guest.\nNo joy was he to my comrades when he did appear!\n“So we lit a fire, and made sacrifice, and ourselves\ntook some of the cheeses and ate them, sat there inside\nwaiting, till he returned with his flock, hefting a great\nload of dry firewood to serve him at suppertime,\nand dumped it down with a crash as he came inside.\nWe shrank back, terrified, into the back of the cave,\nwhile he drove his fat flocks into the roomy cavern—\nall, that is, that he milked; the males he left outside,\nhe-goats and rams, there in the deep yard. Then\nhe lifted and put in place a huge and massive\ndoor stone: not twenty-two four-wheeled wagons,\nstrong ones, would have sufficed to raise it off the threshold,\nsuch a towering mass of rock he set in the doorway!\nThen down he sat and milked the ewes and bleating she-goats,\nall in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\nNext, once he’d curdled half the white milk, he collected\nthe curds in wicker baskets and put them aside.\nThe remaining half he left in the pails, so it would be handy\nto take and drink, and be ready for him at supper.\nBut after he’d busied himself with these tasks, he rekindled\nthe fire, and caught sight of us, and questioned us, saying:\n‘So, strangers, who are you? From where was it you sailed here\nover the watery ways? On business? Or do you rove at random,\ncruising the sea like pirates, who, at risk of their own lives,\ngo around making trouble for men from other lands?’\n“So he spoke, and we succumbed to panic in our hearts,\nterrified by his deep voice and his monstrous person;\nyet even so I responded, and addressed him, saying:\n‘We are, if you please, Achaians, driven wandering from Troy\nby all the winds, across the great gulf of the sea,\nseeking our homes, but blown on a different route,\nthe wrong paths: Zeus, I guess, must have planned it thus.\nWe are, we claim, men serving Atreus’ son Agamemnon—\nwhose fame now is unsurpassed under heaven, so great\na city he sacked, so many people he slew! But we\nwho come to you now are suppliants, clasp your knees,\nhoping you’ll treat us as guests, or in some other way\ngive us some kind of present, as is proper with strangers.\nKind sir, revere the gods! We are here as your suppliants,\nand Zeus is the protector of suppliants and strangers,\nthe strangers’ god, who looks after respectful guests.’\n“So I spoke. And he with pitiless heart responded:\n‘You’re a fool, stranger, or you must come from far away,\ntelling me either to fear or to steer clear of the gods!\nThe Kyklopes pay no attention to Zeus of the aegis,\nnor to the blessed gods—we’re far mightier than they!\nNor would I, to avoid the wrath of Zeus, spare either\nyou or your comrades, unless the spirit so moved me!\nBut where, coming here, did you leave your well-built ship?\nFar off was it, or nearby? Tell me: I’d like to know.’\n“So he spoke, testing me; but I knew too much to be tricked,\nand when I replied it was with guile of my own:\n‘My ship was broken up by Poseidon the Earth-Shaker,\nwho cast it upon the rocks at the frontier of your country:\nclose to the headland he drove it: the wind brought it ashore.\nBut I, and these men here, eluded sheer destruction.’\n“So I spoke. He, with ruthless heart, made me no answer,\nbut sprang up, laid hands on my comrades, grappled two,\nand down on the ground, as though they were mere puppies,\ndashed them: their brains spilled earthwards, wetted the floor.\nThen limb from limb he tore them to prepare his supper,\nand devoured them like a mountain-bred lion, leaving nothing—\ninnards and flesh, bones with the marrow in them,\nwhile we, lamenting, reached out our hands to Zeus\nat the sight of such bestial deeds. Helplessness overmastered\nour hearts. When the Kyklops had glutted his vast belly\nby gobbling human flesh, washed down with unmixed milk,\nhe settled to sleep in the cave, stretched out among his sheep.\nSo I planned an attack on him in my great-hearted spirit:\nI’d steal up close, draw the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\nand drive it into his breast, where the midriff cups the liver,\nfinding the spot with my hand. But a second thought stopped me—\nwe too would have perished there, faced sheer destruction,\nfor we could never have thrust back from the lofty\nentrance with our bare hands the huge stone he’d set there,\nand so, lamenting, we lay there, awaiting the bright Dawn.\n“As soon as Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nhe rekindled the fire, and began milking his fine flocks,\nall in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\nThen after he’d briskly accomplished his various tasks\nhe again grabbed two men together, and readied his meal.\nWhen he’d eaten, he drove his fat flocks out of the cave,\neasily shifting the enormous door-stone, and afterwards\nsetting it back in place, like the lid on a quiver.\nThen, whistling loudly, the Kyklops steered his fat flocks\nuphill, and I was left there, planning mischief deep in my heart—\nto get back at him, have Athene let me boast of what I’d done!\n“Now this was the plan that seemed, to my mind, the likeliest:\nThe Kyklops had left a great club beside a sheep pen,\nof green olive wood, that he’d cut to carry with him\nwhen it had dried out. Eyeing this, we compared it\nin size to the mast of a black ship of twenty oars,\na broad-beamed merchantman, one that crosses the great\nsea gulf—so huge did its length and breadth look to us.\nI went and chopped off a piece about a fathom long:\nhanded this to my comrades, told them to scrape it down,\nand they made it smooth, while I stood there and sharpened\nits point, then took and hardened it in the blazing fire,\nand stowed it out of sight, hiding it under the dung\nthat was strewn throughout the cave in heaped-up piles.\nI ordered the others to cast lots to decide\nwhich ones would dare, with me, to hoist up this stake\nand ram it into his eye, when sweet sleep overcame him.\nThe lot picked out the same ones whom I’d have chosen,\nfour of them; with these, as the fifth, I picked myself.\n“In the evening back he came, herding his fine-fleeced flocks,\nand straightway drove his fat flocks into the wide cave—\nall of them, left none outside in the deep enclosure:\nsome idea of his own, perhaps—or a god’s command?\nHe lifted and put in place the huge and massive door-stone,\nthen sat down and milked the ewes and bleating she–goats,\nall in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\nThen after he’d briskly accomplished his various tasks\nhe again grabbed two men together, and readied his meal.\nIt was now that I spoke to the Kyklops, going and standing\nbeside him, in my hands an ivy-wood bowl of dark wine:\n‘Here, Kyklops, drink this wine, now you’ve fed on human flesh,\nand learn what fine wine it is that’s stowed aboard our ship:\nI was bringing it as a libation, hoping you’d feel pity\nfor me, and send me on homeward; but your mad fury\nis not to be borne! Cruel wretch, how in future will any man\nin the world come near you? What you’ve done is an outrage.’\n“So I spoke. He took the wine, drained it, was vastly pleased\nas he swilled the sweet stuff, demanded a second bowlful:\n‘Quick, give me some more—and also tell me your name,\nnow, at once! I want to give you a guest-gift you’ll enjoy!\nFor the Kyklopes too the grain-giving earth bears vines\nwith rich clusters of grapes, and Zeus’ rain makes them grow;\nbut this—this is a match for ambrosia and nectar!’\n“So he spoke; and I once more brought him the bright wine.\nThree bowlfuls I fetched and gave him, three times in his folly\nhe drained them. Then, when the wine had fuddled his wits,\nI addressed him with honey-sweet words, saying: ‘Kyklops,\ndo you ask me my famous name? Very well, I will tell you—\nand then you give me that guest-gift, just as you promised!\nNobody is my name, Nobody’s what I’m called by\nmy mother and father and all my comrades.’\n“So I spoke,\nand at once he with pitiless heart responded: ‘Nobody\nI shall eat last of all, when I’ve had all his companions,\nand the others first: so, that will be your guest-gift.’\n“So saying, he swayed and fell on his back, lay sprawling\nwith his thick neck twisted sideways: overmastering sleep\npossessed him, from his gullet there gushed out wine\nand gobbets of human flesh, as he drunkenly vomited.\nIt was now that I thrust the stake deep into the embers\nto let it get hot, and encouraged all my companions\nwith heartening words, lest any back off from fear.\nThen, just as the olive-wood stake, though green, was about\nto catch fire, and was glowing, intensely incandescent,\nI leaned close, pulled it clear of the flames. My companions\ncrowded around me. Some god breathed great courage into us.\nThe others grasped the olive-wood stake, sharp-pointed,\nand rammed it into his eye, while I leaned over it,\nand twisted it round. As when a man with a drill\nbores a ship timber, and those below keep it turning\nwith a strap held at either end, and the drill runs nonstop—\njust so we grasped and in his eye kept turning\nthat fire-sharpened stake: round the red-hot orb blood ran.\nEyelids and eyebrows alike were singed by the fiery breath\nfrom the burning eyeball: its roots now crackled in the heat.\nAs when a blacksmith plunges a great axe or an adze\nin cold water to temper it, and it hisses loudly—\nfor this is how iron achieves its greatest strength—just so\ndid his eye now hiss around the olive-wood point. He gave\na terrible scream, that made the rock resound,\nand we shrank back in terror. He tore the stake, all slobbered\nwith fresh-shed blood, from his eye, and with both arms\nhurled it from him, maddened with pain, and screamed aloud\nto the other Kyklopes, those who were his neighbors,\ndwelling in caves near the windswept mountaintops,\nand they heard him cry out, and gathered from all around,\nand stood by the cave and asked him what was the matter:\n‘What great hurt, Polyphemos, is it makes you scream like that\nthrough the ambrosial night, and rouse us all from sleep?\nSurely no mortal is rustling your flocks against your will?\nSurely you’re not being murdered by guile or by force?’\n“From within\nthe cave mighty Polyphemos answered them thus: ‘My friends,\nNobody’s killing me by guile, not by force.’ To this,\naddressing him with winged words, they now responded:\n ‘If no one is harming you, then, and you’re alone, there’s no\nway you can dodge a sickness sent by great Zeus: you must\njust offer up prayers to our father, Lord Poseidon.’\n“So they spoke,\nand departed. I laughed in my heart at the way that name,\nand my faultless planning, had so deceived them. Meanwhile\nthe Kyklops, groaning and suffering agonies of pain,\ngroped with his hands, took the stone from the cave’s entrance,\nand sat there in the opening with both arms wide outstretched,\nhoping to catch anybody who tried to slip out with the sheep—\ndid he really suppose I was going to be that stupid?\nBy now I’d figured out just what I would have to do\nto find an escape from death both for my companions\nand for myself: I’d thought of every trick and device\nthat might save our lives: the threat was great and immediate.\nNow this, to my mind, looked the best of such plans:\nThere were the rams, well-nourished and thickly fleeced,\nfine strapping specimens, the wool on them violet-dark.\nThese I silently tied together with pliable withies—\non which the Kyklops, bred in lawlessness, would sleep—\ntaking three at a time: the middle one carried a man,\nwhile the ones on each flank gave my comrades protection:\nthus each three sheep bore one person. As for myself,\nthere was one special ram, the best in the whole flock:\nhim I grasped by the back, curled up under his shaggy belly,\nand lay with my hands twisted into his marvelous fleece,\nholding on tight, with great patience, never relaxing.\nAnd so, lamenting, we lay there, awaiting the bright dawn.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthen the males of the flocks sallied out of the cave to pasture,\nwhile the ewes went bleating about their pens, unmilked,\nwith bursting udders. Their master, in agonizing pain,\nkept feeling along the backs of all his sheep\nas they stood before him. The booby never perceived\nthat under his rich-fleeced sheep there were men tied on!\nLast of the flock the ram approached the entrance, heavy\nwith his thick wool—and with me and my quick thinking!\nGroping his back, the strong Polyphemos addressed him, saying:\n‘Dear ram, why do you come thus through the cave, the very\nlast of the flock? You used not to lag behind the others,\nbut were always first out, to graze on the lushest pasture,\nstriding ahead, the first to reach the flowing river,\nthe first that liked to head back into the sheepfold when\nevening came on. But now you’re the last of all. Are you mourning,\nmaybe, your master’s lost eye, which a wicked man put out,\nhe and his wretched fellows, when he’d doused my wits with wine—\nNobody—who, I tell you, is not clear of destruction yet !\nIf you only could think as I do and had the power of speech\nto tell me where that creature is hiding away from my might,\nthen would his brains, dashed out, lie scattered over the ground\nthroughout the cave, and my spirit would be lightened\nof all the ills which that nothing-worth Nobody’s brought me.’\nSo saying, he let the ram go on out through the entrance.\n“When we’d moved on a little way from the cave and the enclosure,\nfirst I loosed myself from the ram, then untied my comrades.\nQuickly then we drove off the fat, smart-stepping sheep,\nglancing back all the time, until we reached our ship.\nA welcome sight to our dear comrades were those of us\nwho’d escaped death: for the others they started wailing.\nBut this I stopped, with a silent upward jerk of the head\nthat said ‘No’ to their weeping. I told them to throw on board,\nfast, all the fine-fleeced sheep, and to put to sea at once.\nThey came aboard quickly, each man to his rowlock, and seated\nin proper order they struck the grey brine with their oars,\nand when we had backed offshore as far as a man’s shout\nwould carry, I called out to the Kyklops with mocking words:\n‘Kyklops, it was, then, no weakling whose comrades you planned,\nby might and brute force, to eat in your hollow cave! In full\nwere your evil deeds to rebound on your own head, vile wretch,\nwho did not shrink from eating the guests in your house, for which\nZeus and the other gods have exacted requital from you.’\n“So I spoke, and my words made him yet more angry at heart,\nso that he wrenched off, and hurled at us, the peak of a lofty\nmountain, that fell just in front of our dark-prowed vessel,\nnarrowly missing the end of the steering oar: the sea\nsurged up under the falling rock’s impact, created\na wave that carried our vessel straight back shoreward,\na heaving swell from the deep, aimed directly at the land.\nBut I seized a very long pole in my hands and thrust us\nclear once more, and urgently signed to my comrades\nto row for dear life, and get us away from danger,\ngesturing with my head. They bent to their oars, and rowed.\nBut when, working hard at the sea, we’d doubled the distance,\nthen I shouted again to the Kyklops, though all around\nmy comrades with calming arguments tried stop me:\n‘Stubborn wretch, why so set on infuriating this savage?\nJust now he flung some missile seaward, drove our vessel\nback to land—indeed, we thought we were done for!\nIf he’d heard any one of us making a sound, or shouting,\nhe’d have broken our heads as well as the ship’s timbers\nwith a cast of some sharp glinting boulder, so mighty his arm!’\n“Thus they spoke, but could not shift my great-hearted spirit,\nand I answered him back, irate and resentful at heart:\n‘Kyklops, if any mortal, of all mankind, should ask you\nabout your eye’s unseemly blindness, tell them it was\nOdysseus, sacker of cities, who destroyed your eyesight:\nLaertes’ son, who calls Ithake his home.’\n“So I spoke,\nand he groaned aloud, and then responded to me, saying:\n‘Alas, that ancient prophecy has indeed come true for me!\nThere once was a prophet here, a great gentleman too—\nTelemos, Eurymos’ son, a man unmatched in seercraft,\nwho grew old as a diviner among the Kyklopes: he\ntold me that all these things would happen in time to come,\nthat by Odysseus’ hands I’d be deprived of my sight.\nBut I always thought it would be some tall and handsome\nhero who’d show up here, endowed with mighty strength:\nBut in fact it’s this puny, no-account weakling who’s\ndeprived me of eyesight after fuddling my wits with wine!\nCome back here, Odysseus, and let me offer you guest-gifts,\nand urge the famed Earth-Shaker to grant you conveyance home,\nfor I am his son, and he avows that he’s my father.\nHe himself, if he so chooses, will heal me—he, and none other,\nwhether one of the blessed gods or some mortal human.’\n“So he spoke, and I answered him, saying: ‘How I wish\nI had the power to strip you of breath and life, and send you\ndown to the realm of Hades, as surely as no one\nwill heal your eye, not even the Earth-Shaker himself.’\n“So I spoke, and he then prayed to the lord Poseidon,\nreaching out both his hands to the starry heavens: ‘Hear me,\nPoseidon, dark-haired Earth-Shaker, if I am truly\nyour son, if you avow yourself my father! Grant\nthat Laertes’ son, whose home is on Ithake,\nOdysseus, sacker of cities, shall not reach home—\nBut if it’s fated that he’s to see his loved ones again,\nto come back to his well-built house and his native land,\nmay he get there late, in bad shape, all his comrades lost,\nin a ship not his own, and be met with trouble in his home!’\n“So he spoke in prayer, and was heard by the dark-haired god.\nThen once more he hefted an even greater rock\nand swung and hurled it, putting huge force into the throw,\nand it landed only a little behind our dark-prowed vessel,\nnarrowly missing the end of the steering oar: the sea\nsurged up under the falling rock’s impact, created\na wave that carried our vessel straight on shoreward:\nand so we came back to the island where all our other\nwell-benched ships lay together, and around them sat\nour comrades in tears, forever awaiting our return.\nWhen we got there we ran up our vessel onto the beach,\nand ourselves disembarked upon the sandy strand.\nThe Kyklops’ sheep we fetched out from the hollow ship\nand allotted them so that no one got less than his fair share.\nBut the ram my well-greaved comrades allotted to me alone\nwhen the sheep were shared out, as a special prize: on the shore\nthis ram to Zeus, Kronos’ son, dark-clouded, omnipotent,\nI sacrificed, burned the thighs. But he ignored my offering:\nhe had in mind the destruction of all my well-benched ships,\nand every last one of my trusty comrades. So then\nthe whole long day until the going down of the sun\nwe sat feasting on meat in abundance and sweet wine;\nbut when the sun had set and darkness came on\nthen we lay down and slept along the line of the shore.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthen indeed I aroused my companions and ordered them\nto embark themselves, and to cast off the stern warps.\nThey came aboard quickly, seated themselves at the rowlocks,\nand sitting in order struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\n“So we sailed on from there, lamenting at heart, but relieved\nat having got clear of death, though we’d lost our comrades.”\n",

         "\n“To the isle of Aiolia then we came, where was the dwelling\nof Aiolos, Hippotas’ son, much loved by the deathless gods,\non a floating island: encircling it was a rampart\nof unbreakable bronze: the rock ran up sheer and smooth.\nTwelve offspring of his besides were established in his halls,\nSix daughters there were, and also six lusty sons:\nthe daughters he gave to the sons to be their bedfellows.\nThese always eat with their dear father and loving mother,\nand countless fine dishes are ready to hand before them.\nThe house smells of food, reechoes with their chatter\nevery day; but at nighttime, beside their modest wives,\nthey sleep under blankets upon their corded bedsteads.\nIt was, then, to their city and fine abode that we came,\nand for a full month he befriended me, asked about everything—\nIlion, Argive vessels, the homecoming of the Achaians,\nand I told him the whole story, just as it happened.\nWhen I asked him about our own journey, wanted his help\nin sending us on our way, he denied me nothing, furnished\nconveyance, gave me a bag he’d made from the flayed hide\nof a nine-year-old ox, in which he’d imprisoned the paths\nof the blustering winds: Kronos’ son had made him their steward,\nempowered to calm or arouse them, as he might choose.\nThis he put in my hollow ship, tied fast with a shining cord\nof silver, that let no breeze, however slight, escape.\nFor me, however, he sent a breath of the west wind to blow\nthat would bear ships and men home; but he wasn’t destined\nto bring this about: our own folly was what undid us.\n“For nine days on end we sailed, both by day and by night,\nand now on the tenth our homeland came into sight—\nclose enough indeed to see men tending their watch fires:\nthen it was that sweet sleep came upon me in my exhaustion,\nfor I’d handled the sheet throughout, wouldn’t let any other\ncrew member have it, to get us back home the sooner.\nBut my comrades had started to mutter among themselves,\nsaid I was bringing home gold and silver as presents\nfrom Aiolos, Hippotas’ great-hearted son; and thus\nwould one, with a sidelong glance, sound off to his neighbor:\n‘Look how this fellow is always loved and honored\nby all men, whatever city or land he comes to!\nMuch rich treasure he’s bringing back home from Troy\nout of the booty, while we, who went through the selfsame\nventure as he did, are returning empty-handed!\nAnd now he’s been given these further generous gifts\nby Aiolos, out of friendship! So let’s take a quick look\nand see how much gold and silver there is in that bag!’\n“So they spoke,\nand this evil advice of my companions was accepted.\nThey opened the bag, and all the winds rushed out—\na storm wind instantly seized them, bore them seaward\nweeping, away from their native land; and I,\nwaking, debated in my own blameless spirit\nwhether to plunge overboard, and perish in the deep,\nor to endure in silence, remain among the living.\nI held on and stayed, head covered, lying there\nin my ship. By this evil gale our vessels were carried\nright back to Aiolos’ island, my comrades lamenting.\n“There we went ashore and took aboard more water,\nand my comrades at once ate a meal beside the swift ships.\nBut when we’d gotten a taste of food and drink,\nthen I, taking with me a herald and one companion,\nmade my way to Aiolos’ famed abode, and found him\nat dinner, along with his wife and children. We entered\nhis house, and sat by the doorposts, at the threshold.\nThey were amazed to see us, and questioned us, saying:\n‘Why are you here, Odysseus? What mean god assailed you?\nWe dispatched you with all kindness, to ensure you’d come\nsafely to home and country, or wherever you wanted.’\n“So they spoke; and, grieving at heart, I then explained to them:\n‘My wretched companions undid me; they, and damnable\nslumber! My friends, help me now: you have the power.’\n“So I spoke, addressing them with conciliatory words;\nbut they remained silent. Then their father made this response:\n‘Leave this island at once, most abject of living creatures!\nIt’s not proper for me to aid or provide conveyance\nto a man whom the blessed gods abominate! Begone!\nYou come here as one marked out by divine hostility!’\n“That said, he dismissed me, groaning heavily, from his domain.\nSo from there we pushed on still further, grieving at heart,\nthe men’s spirit worn down by the hardship of rowing, since,\ndue to our folly, we no longer had a good wind behind us.\nFor six more days, then, we voyaged on, day and night,\nand on the seventh we reached the steep citadel of Lamos,\nLaistrygonian Telepylos, where shepherd greets shepherd\none driving his flock back home, out to pasture the other.\nThere a man that needed no sleep could earn a double wage,\nby both herding cattle, and tending white sheep, so close\ndo the paths of the night and the day run on together.\nWhen we reached the fine harbor there—a sheer cliff face\nran all the way round it from side to side, while two\nprojecting headlands, confronting each another, loomed large\nat the mouth, leaving only a restricted entrance—\nthen all the rest went on in with their well-curved vessels.\nand moored them there, snug inside the hollow harbor,\npacked side by side, for no wave ever stirred there,\neither great or small; all around was a bright calm.\nBut I alone held my black ship back outside\nat the furthest edge, hitched my cables to a rock;\nthen climbed to a rugged lookout point, and stood there.\nLooking round, I saw no cattle, no human activity, nothing\nexcept for a trace of smoke drifting skyward from the earth.\nSo I then sent out some comrades to go ahead and discover\nwhat kind of men, among earth’s bread-eaters, dwelt here:\ntwo men I chose, and a third to go with them as herald.\nThey went ashore and followed a beaten track, by which\nwagons would haul down wood to the city from the hilltops.\nOutside the city they met a girl who was drawing water—\nthe strapping daughter, this, of a certain Laistrygonian,\nAntiphates: she’d come down to the fair-flowing spring,\nArtakie, from which they carried their water into town.\nSo they approached her, spoke to her, asked her questions—\nWho was king of these people, and who were his subjects?\nShe promptly showed them her father’s high-roofed house.\nWhen they entered this famed domain, they found his wife at home,\nhuge as a mountain peak, and were horrified by her.\nShe at once summoned famous Antiphates, her husband,\nfrom assembly: he devised a miserable fate for them.\nOne of my comrades he grabbed, prepared him for dinner,\nBut the other two took to their heels, got away to the ships.\nThen he raised a cry through the city, and when they heard it\nthe powerful Laistrygonians thronged in from all around,\nthousands of them, resembling not human beings, but Giants!\nFrom the cliffs with boulders—each one a man-sized load—\nthey showered us: a ghastly sound rose up from the ships\nof men dying and tinber shattering. They speared them\nlike fishes, carried them off to have as their gruesome meal.\nBut while they were murdering those inside the deep harbor,\nI meanwhile, drawing the sharp sword from by my thigh\nwith it cut the stern cables of my dark-prowed vessel,\nand quickly called to my comrades, urging, commanding them\nto row for dear life, get us clear of disaster. They all,\nin terror of death ripped up the salt spume with their oar blades.\nAh, the joy of escaping those sheer cliffs, getting out to sea—\nfor my ship alone: all the rest now perished as they lay there.\n“So we sailed on from there, lamenting at heart, but glad\nat having escaped from death, though we’d lost our comrades;\nand we came to the isle of Aiaia, that was the home\nof fair-tressed Kirke, dread goddess of mortal speech—\nfull sister was she to the evil-minded Aietes,\nand both were begotten by Helios, bringer of light,\non Perse, their mother, whom Ocean had as his daughter.\nThere we put in to land with our ship, and silently steered her\ninto a well-sheltered harbor, with some god guiding us.\nThen, after disembarking, we lay there two days and nights\neating our hearts with out with fatigue and sorrow;\nBut when fair-tressed Dawn ushered in the third day, then\nI took my spear and my keen-edged sword, and quickly\nclimbed on up from the ship to a point with a good view\nin my search for signs of field work or of human voices.\nI got to a rocky outcrop, a lookout station, and stood there,\nand glimpsed smoke wavering up from the wide-wayed earth\nout of Kirke’s dwelling, through dense coppices and leafage.\nSo then I pondered, in my mind and spirit, whether—\nhaving seen fire and smoke—I should go and find out more;\nand as I reflected, it struck me that this was the best course:\nto go back to my swift ship first, and to the seashore,\ngive my comrades a meal, but then send them to investigate.\nBut as I went, and came close to my well-curved vessel,\nthen, too, some god, seeing me alone, felt pity,\nand sent, right into my path, a huge high-antlered stag\non his way from his forest range to drink at the river,\nsince the sun’s strong heat had got to him. As he emerged,\nI speared him, in mid-back, piercing his spine: the bronze\nspear now transfixed him, he uttered a dying cry\nand collapsed in the dust. The spirit fled from him. Then,\none foot on his back, I tugged the bronze spear out\nfrom the wound, left the carcass there on the ground,\nwhile I plucked still-growing stems and osiers, wove them\ninto a fathom-long rope, well twisted at either end,\nand, tying the feet of this monstrous beast together,\nslung it across my back, and went on to the black ship\nleaning upon my spear, since no way could I support it\nwith one hand upon my shoulder, so huge a brute it was.\nI dumped it in front of the ship, and spoke encouraging words\nto my comrades, addressing each individual in turn:\n‘Not yet, friends, for all our grief, shall we go down\nto Hades’ realm before our destined day arrives!\nSo come, while there’s still food and drink in our swift ship\nLet’s think about eating, not waste away from hunger!’\n“So I spoke: they at once paid heed to my words, uncovered\ntheir faces, and, on that shore by the unharvested sea,\nstared in awe at the stag: a huge beast it was indeed.\nBut when they’d feasted their eyes upon this spectacle\nthey washed their hands and made ready a truly splendid feast.\n“So the whole long day until the going down of the sun\nwe sat feasting on meat in abundance, drinking sweet wine;\nbut when the sun had set and darkness came on\nthen we lay down and slept along the line of the shore.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nI called an assembly and then addressed them all, declaring:\n‘Heed what I say, my comrades, for all your grim suffering!\nDear friends, we don’t know where darkness lies, or dawn,\nor where the sun that brings light to mortals goes down\nunder the earth, or rises; but let us take thought, quickly:\nIs there any course open to us? Myself, I do not think so.\nI climbed to a rugged lookout point and surveyed\nthe island. The boundless deep encircles it all around.\nIt’s low-lying land: I did see smoke, in the middle,\nwavering up through dense coppices and leafage.’\n“So I spoke, and their inner spirit was broken, as they\nrecalled the deeds of Antiphates, the Laistrygonian,\nand of the Kyklops, that gross-spirited man-eater.\nThey wept aloud and shed thick-flowing tears,\nbut all their lamenting accomplished nothing for them.\n“I divided my well-greaved comrades into two groups,\nchose a leader for each of them: I myself took command\nof one, put godlike Eurylochos in charge of the other.\nNext, at once, we shook lots in a bronze helmet,\nand out leapt the lot of great-hearted Eurylochos.\nSo he set off, and took with him twenty-two comrades,\nall in tears; and the ones left behind were lamenting too.\n“They found, in a woodland glen, the house of Kirke, built\nof polished stone, and set in a space with a wide vista.\nProwling around it were mountain wolves and lions\nthat she had enchanted by feeding them evil drugs.\nThese beasts did not rush to attack my men, but instead\nfawned round them, rearing, swishing their long tails.\nIn the way that dogs, when their master’s coming from dinner,\nfawn round him, since he always has some tasty tit-bit for them,\nso round my men now fawned these strong-clawed wolves\nand lions. The men were afraid on seeing such scary monsters.\nSo there they stood in the sweet-haired goddess’ forecourt\nand heard Kirke singing inside in an enchanting voice\nas she went to and fro, weaving a great immortal web—\nfine work, exquisite, charming, as is that of all goddesses.\nFirst to find words was Polites, leader of men, the dearest\nto me of all my comrades, and the most devoted:\n‘Friends, there’s some lady inside, going to and fro at the loom\nand singing so sweetly that the whole floor echoes round—\ngoddess or woman, let’s call out to her!’\n“So he spoke,\nand they all clamored, calling out to her. She at once\nthrew open the shining doors, came out herself,\nand invited them in. They all, in their innocence, followed,\nexcept for Eurylochos: he, suspecting a trap, hung back.\nShe escorted them in, sat them down on chairs and benches,\nand offered them barley meal, cheese, and pale yellow honey\nmixed with Pramnian wine; but she added to this mixture\nbaneful drugs to destroy their memory of their homeland.\nWhen she’d given it them and they’d swallowed it, then at once\nshe struck them with her wand, and shut them away in sties:\nthey now all had pigs’ heads, pigs’ voices, and pigs’ bristles,\npigs’ bodies too; but their minds remained unchanged.\nSo they were penned in, weeping; and Kirke threw them\noak nuts to eat, acorns, the fruit of the cornel tree—\nsuch food as swine that sleep on the ground will feed on.\n“Now Eurylochos came straight back to our swift black ship\nto tell us the news of his comrades and their unkind fate.\nBut not one word could he utter, much though he longed to,\nso stricken with great distress was he in his heart; his eyes\nwere brimming with tears, his spirit brooded on lamentation.\nOnly after we questioned him, in our amazement, did he\nthen inform us about the fate of his other comrades:\n‘We went through the wood as you told us, noble Odysseus,\nand found, in a glen, a splendid house, constructed\nof polished stone, and set in a space with a wide vista.\nSomeone inside was going to and fro at a great web, singing\nsweetly, goddess or woman. We all called out to her.\nShe at once threw open the shining doors, emerged,\nand invited us in. The rest, in their innocence, followed.\nBut I held back, suspecting a trap, and they then\nvanished together—not one of them ever returned,\nthough I sat around long enough, watching out for them.’\n“So he spoke. I now slung my silver-studded sword—\nlarge, of bronze—from my shoulders, strapped on my bow\nand quiver, told him to lead me back the way he’d come.\nBut he clutched at my knees with both hands, besought me, wept,\nthen addressed me tearfully with winged words, saying: ‘Don’t\nmake me go back, Zeus’ nursling! Let me stay here!\nI know you’ll never come back yourself, or rescue\nany of your lost comrades! Let’s get out now, with those\nthat are here—we still may escape the day of doom!’\n“So he spoke;\nand I responded to him, saying: ‘Eurylochos you,\nyourself can remain here, right where you are, quite safe,\neating and drinking beside the black hollow ship; but go\nI myself must; a most powerful need is upon me.’\n“So saying, I went my way, up from the ship and the sea.\nI’d passed through the sacred glens, and was near the great\nhouse of Kirke, that expert in the use of countless drugs,\nwhen Hermes met me, god of the golden wand,\non my way to the house, in the likeness of a young man\nwith the first down on his face, when the charm of youth\nis greatest. He took my hand, and said: ‘Where are you off to\nagain, you hapless man, in the highlands, all alone,\nand ignorant of the country? Your comrades in Kirke’s house\nare caged up as pigs in her imprisoning sties. Are you\ncoming here to release them? I tell you, you yourself\nwill never escape, you’ll end up caught like the rest!\nBut see now, I shall free you from harm, and save you—\nHere, take this potent herb, have it with you when you go\nto Kirke’s house: it’ll keep the evil day from your head!\nAnd I’ll tell you all Kirke’s malevolent wiles: she’ll make you\na mixed posset, adding in drugs along with the foodstuff.\nYet not even so will she contrive to bewitch you: the potent\nherb that I’ll give you won’t let her. And I’ll tell you all\nyou must do. When Kirke strikes you with her long wand,\ndraw your sharp sword from beside your thigh, as though\nwith intent kill her. Then she, overcome by terror,\nwill invite you to bed down with her, make love together.\nYou must not, at this point, refuse the bed of the goddess\nif you want her to free your comrades and provide for you;\nbut make her swear a great oath by the blessed gods\nto plan no more nasty trouble against your person,\nlest when she has you naked she’ll weaken and unman you.’\n“So saying, the slayer of Argos gave me the herb,\npulling it out of the ground, and showed me its nature.\nAt its root it was black, but its flower was white as milk:\nMoly is what the gods call it: it’s hard for mortal men\nto dig up; but the gods can do whatever they’ve a mind to.\n“Hermes now departed to lofty Olympos, going\nup through the tree-clad island, while I made my way\nto Kirke’s house, my heart in a turmoil as I went.\nI stood in the forecourt of the fine-tressed goddess\nand standing there called to her. The goddess heard my voice,\nat once came out, flung open the shining doors\nand invited me in. Much troubled at heart, I entered.\nShe led me in and seated me on a silver-studded chair—\nbeautiful, finely crafted, with a footstool for my feet.\nThen she mixed me a posset in a golden cup,\nbut slipped a drug into it, with malevolence in her heart.\nWhen she gave it to me, and I drank it, yet was not bewitched,\nshe struck me with her wand, and had this word for me, saying:\n‘Off to the sty with you! Lie there with your other comrades!’\n“So she spoke. I drew the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\nand charged at Kirke, as though with intent to kill her.\nShe gave a loud scream, slipped under my charge, embraced\nmy knees, and, sobbing, addressed me with winged words, saying:\n‘Who are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\nI’m amazed that you drank my drug and were not bewitched!\nNo other man, ever, has failed to succumb to this drug\nonce he’d drunk it, once it had passed the barrier of his teeth!\nTruly, the mind in your breast is proof against all enchantment.\nYou must be resourceful Odysseus, who—so the slayer of Argos,\nhe of the golden wand, always told me—would visit here\nin his swift black ship, on his way back home from Troy!\nSo come, sheath your sword, let the two of us now go up\ninto my bed, and by mingling there together\nin the passion of love, find trust, each one in the other.’\n“So she spoke; but I answered her thus, with a question, saying:\n‘Kirke, how can you tell me to come and make love with you,\nwhen you’ve turned my comrades to swine, right here in your halls,\nand now you have me here, with malign intent you want me\nto go up into your chamber and your bed, so that when\nyou have me naked you can weaken and unman me?\nNever would I agree to come anywhere near your bed\nunless you, goddess, were to swear me a mighty oath\nthat you’d plan no more malicious trouble against my person.’\n“So I spoke. She at once swore the oath as I requested.\nBut not till she’d sworn, and completed the oath in full,\nwould I agree to go up into Kirke’s sumptuous bed.\nMeanwhile her handmaids were busy around the halls—\nfour of them, those who did all the housework in her home:\nnymphs, these, daughters of the springs and the groves,\nof the sacred rivers that flow to their outfall by the sea.\nOne was hanging fine purple cloths on the headrests\nof chairs and under them spreading white linen foot mats;\nanother was setting up silver tables beside the chairs\nand arranging golden baskets upon them; the third\nof these serving women was mixing sweet mind-honeying\nwine in a silver bowl and setting out golden goblets.\nThe fourth had fetched in water and lit a blazing fire\nbeneath a great cauldron: the water was getting hot.\nWhen it reached boiling point in the bright bronze vessel,\nshe got me into a bath, sluiced me down from the cauldron,\nmixing hot and cold to my taste, bathing head and shoulders\nto ease from my limbs their heart-crushing weariness.\nAfter she’d bathed me, and massaged me with rich oil,\nshe provided me with a splendid mantle and tunic,\nbrought me back, and seated me on a silver-studded chair—\nelegant, finely wrought—with a footstool for my feet.\nA maid brought hand-washing water in a beautiful golden\npitcher and poured it into a silver basin for me\nto wash with and drew up beside me a polished table.\nThe respected housekeeper now set bread beside me,\nwith many side dishes, giving freely of her supplies.\nThen she told me to eat, but I was not so minded:\nI sat brooding on other things: my heart sensed trouble.\n“Now when Kirke saw me thus sitting, not reaching out\nfor food, and overmastered by deep-felt distress, she came\nand stood close beside me, addressed me with winged words, saying:\n‘Odysseus, why are you sitting there like some voiceless person,\neating your heart out, touching neither food nor drink?\nDo you maybe anticipate some new trick? You don’t need\nto be afraid: I’ve already sworn that powerful oath.’\n“So she spoke:\nbut to her I then responded, saying: ‘Kirke, tell me,\nwhat kind of man is it, in his right mind, could bear\nto taste food or drink before he’d secured freedom\nfor his comrades, had seen them with his own eyes? If you\nreally mean it when you tell me to eat and drink, then free them!\nAnd let me set eyes myself on these, my trusty comrades.’\n“So I spoke. Kirke now made her way out through the hall,\nwand in hand, flung open the doors of the sty, and drove\nmy men out, embodied as hogs some nine years old.\nThey stood there before her, and she went in among them,\nanointing each one with a different magic salve, so that\nthe bristles earlier grown there by the deadly drug\nthat the lady Kirke had given them now sloughed off their limbs:\nmen they became again, more youthful than previously,\na great deal more handsome, much taller in their carriage.\nThey recognized me: each one of them clung to my hands.\nA yearning for lamentation came on us all, and the house\nechoed terribly round us: the goddess herself felt pity.\n“Then she, bright among goddesses, approached me and said:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\ngo down now to your swift ship, there on the seashore.\nFirst thing of all, haul your vessel high up upon the beach,\nthen store all your goods and equipment in the caves,\nthen come back yourself and bring your trusty comrades.’\n“So she spoke, and my proud spirit was persuaded.\nI made my way down to the swift ship and the seashore,\nand there by the swift ship I found my trusty comrades\nlamenting piteously and shredding big tears. As country\ncalves will come frisking about a herd of cows\non their way back to the dung yard, replete with fodder—\nin a mass they confront them, the pens no longer contain them,\nand endlessly lowing they keep scampering round\ntheir mothers—so these men, when they set eyes upon me,\nthronged round me weeping: it seemed to them in their hearts\nas though they’d got back to their homeland, to the actual\ntownship of rugged Ithake where they were born and bred.\nLamenting now they addressed me with winged words, saying:\n‘We’re as delighted, Zeus’ nursling, by your return, as if\nwe’d got back home to Ithake, to our native country!\nBut come now, tell us the fate of our other companions.’\n“So they spoke, and I gave them a reassuring response:\n‘First thing of all, haul our vessel high up upon the beach,\nthen store all our goods and equipment in the caves.\nThat done, you—all of you—come quickly along with me\nto the sacred halls of Kirke, where you’ll see your comrades\neating and drinking, from a never-failing abundance.’\n“So I spoke, and they were quick to obey my instructions.\nOnly Eurylochos tried to hold back all our comrades,\nand addressed them with winged words, saying: ‘You wretched\ncreatures, where are we going? Why long for these troubles,\nwhen going down into Kirke’s domain will surely\ntransform each one of us into swine or wolves or lions,\ncondemned, under obligation, to guard her great abode?\nThat’s how the Kyklops acted when our comrades entered\nhis farmstead and headstrong Odysseus went in with them:\nit was through this man’s recklessness that they too perished.’\n“So he spoke; I debated in my mind then whether I should\nunsheathe the long sword from beside my sturdy thigh,\nand cut off his head with it, lay him low, although\nclose kin by marriage he was to me; but my comrades\none after another with honey-sweet words restrained me:\n‘Scion of Zeus, give the order, and we’ll leave this man here\nto stay by the ship and to guard it; but as for us,\nwhat we want is for you to lead us to Kirke’s sacred abode.’\n“So saying, they started off then, up from the ship and the sea;\nnor was Eurylochos left behind by the hollow ship,\nbut came with the rest of us, fearing my strong reproof.\n“Meanwhile, back in her house, Kirke with loving care\nbathed the rest of my comrades, massaged them with rich oil,\nand dressed them up in fine wool mantles and tunics;\nwe found them all having a good dinner there in her halls.\nBut when my men saw and recognized one another,\nthey wept and lamented: the house reechoed around them.\nThen she, bright among goddesses, approached me and said:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\nno longer need you all raise this loud lament! I too know\nthe sum of the troubles you suffered out on the fish-rich deep\nand every wrong that’s been done you by hostile men on land.\nBut come now, eat your food and drink your wine, until\nyou once more recover that spirit you had in your breasts\nto begin with when you set out from your native land\nof rugged Ithake—but now you’re worn and dispirited,\nforever recalling your rough wandering, nor has your heart\nknown any joy, since indeed you’ve suffered greatly.’\n“So she spoke, and our proud spirits consented,\nand day after day, for the course of a whole year\nwe sat there feasting on plentiful meat and wine.\nbut when a year had passed, as the turning seasons\nof the months went by, and the long days came to an end,\nthen my trusty companions assailed me with their complaints:\n‘Are you out of your mind? High time to think of your homeland\nif it’s truly your destiny to be saved and to return\nto your high-roofed house and to your own native country.’\n“So they spoke, and my proud spirit consented.\nSo all day long until the setting of the sun\nwe sat there feasting on plentiful meat and sweet wine;\nbut when the sun went down and darkness came on,\nand they retired to sleep along the shadowy halls,\nthen I myself went up into Kirke’s sumptuous bed\nand clasped her knees in entreaty. The goddess heard\nand listened. I addressed her with winged words, saying:\n‘Kirke, fulfill for me now the promise you made, that you’d\nconvey me home: my spirit’s eager to be on its way,\nlikewise the rest of my comrades, who nag me to death\nas they grieve around me, whenever you’re somewhere else.’\n“So I spoke. Bright among goddesses, she at once replied:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\nyou all need stay in my house no longer against your will;\nbut there is another journey you must accomplish first:\nyou must go to the realm of Hades and dread Persephone,\nto consult the ghostly spirit of Theban Teiresias,\nblind seer, whose reasoning mind remains intact,\nsince on him alone, when dead, Persephone bestowed\nfull mental powers: the rest are only flitting shadows.’\n“So she spoke. But the spirit within me was shattered:\nI wept as I sat on the bed, and my heart no longer\nhad any desire to live, to behold the sunlight.\nBut when I’d had my fill of weeping and agonizing,\nI found the words to reply with, and addressed her, saying:\n‘Kirke, who will serve as our guide upon this journey?\nNo one yet in a black ship has ever voyaged to Hades.’\n“So I spoke. She, bright among goddesses, at once replied:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\ndon’t worry about installing a pilot aboard your ship—\nJust set up your mast, spread your white sail, and then\nsit down, and let the north wind carry you onward!\nBut when in your ship you’ve traversed the stream of Ocean,\nand come to a wooded shore and the groves of Persephone,\nwith their tall poplars, and willows that shed their fruit,\nthere beach your vessel, close by deep-eddying Ocean,\nand yourself go on to the dank domain of Hades. There\nit is that into Acheron Pyriphlegethon flows,\nand Kokytos, that branches off from the waters of Styx:\na rock marks the confluence of these two loud rivers.\nGo close in there, hero, exactly as I instruct you,\nand dig out a pit, about a cubit deep and wide,\nand around it pour a libation to all the dead—\nfirst with milk and honey, then with sweet wine,\nand thirdly with water: sprinkle white barley on it,\nand entreat the weak heads of the dead with many vows—\nthat when you’re back on Ithake you’ll sacrifice the best\nbarren heifer in your domain, load the pyre with good things,\nand, just for Teiresias, you’ll make a sacrifice\nof an all-black ram, the finest one in your flocks.\nThen, when you’ve supplicated the famous tribes of the dead,\nyou must slaughter a ram and a black ewe, making them face\ntoward Erebos, while you turn your back on them, reach out\nto the streams of the river. This is the place where many\nghosts of those who have perished will now gather.\nAt that point arouse your comrades, and command them\nto take the sheep that lie there, slain by the ruthless bronze,\nand flay and burn them, along with prayers to the gods—\nstrong Hades and dread Persephone. You yourself,\ndrawing the keen-edged sword from beside your thigh,\nmust sit there, and not allow the weak heads of the dead\nto get near the blood until you’ve questioned Teiresias.\nThe seer will then quickly approach you, leader of men:\nHe will show you your route, explain your journey’s stages,\nyour homecoming, how you’re to traverse the fish-rich deep.’\n“So she spoke; and at once the golden-throned Dawn arose.\nShe gave me a mantle to wear, and a tunic; and she, the nymph,\ndressed herself in a long white robe, made of finely\nwoven and beautiful stuff, and around her waist\nknotted a fine golden sash, set a veil on her head.\nNow I went through the house and aroused my comrades\nwith kindly words, approaching each man in turn:\n‘Lie no longer in bed enjoying sweet slumber! Time\nfor us to be going! Lady Kirke has briefed me fully.’\n“So I spoke, and their proud spirits consented. Yet not\neven from there could I get my comrades away\nwithout loss. The youngest, Elpenor—neither outstanding\nin battle nor yet particularly bright-minded—had\nlain down apart from his comrades in Kirke’s house,\nin search of cool air, being heavy with wine, on the roof.\nHearing the noise and clatter of his comrades stirring\nhe got up suddenly, and, quite forgetting that he should\nmake his way back down by way of the long ladder,\nfell headlong off the roof: his neck was snapped through\nat the spine, and his ghost went down to Hades’ realm.\n“As my men were bustling about I spoke among them, saying:\n‘You may think you’re on the way to your own dear country,\nbut Kirke’s informed me we must first make another journey,\nto the realm of Hades and of dread Persephone, there\nto consult the ghostly spirit of Theban Teiresias.’\n“So I spoke, and their spirit was shattered within them, they\nsat down wherever they were, and wailed, and tore their hair;\nbut all their lamenting accomplished nothing for them.\n“While we were on our way to the swift ship and the seashore,\nfull of sorrow and shedding big tears, meanwhile\nKirke had gone on ahead of us and tethered there,\nby the black ship, a ram and a black ewe,\novertaking us easily; when gods don’t desire it, who\ncan witness their passage, either coming or going?”\n",

         "\n“But when we came down to the ship and the sea, first off\nwe hauled our vessel into the bright salt water, and then\nstepped the mast, set the sail in the black ship, and took\nthe sheep and put them aboard, and ourselves embarked,\nfull of sorrow and shedding big tears. For us\nin the wake of our dark-prowed vessel a following breeze\nthat filled our sail, a trusty companion, was sent us\nby fair-tressed Kirke, dread goddess of mortal speech.\nSo when we’d secured the tackle throughout the ship we then\nsat down, leaving wind and steersman to keep her on her course.\nAll day long her sail spread taut as she sheared through the deep,\ntill the sun went down and all the ways were in shadow.\nShe came to the boundary marked by deep-flowing Ocean,\nwhere are the land and settlement of the Kimmerians,\nenveloped in mist and cloud: upon them never\ndoes the bright-gleaming sun look down with his rays,\neither while he’s climbing into the starry heavens\nor when he turns back again from heaven to earth,\nbut deathly night’s spread out over hapless mortals.\n“There we now came, and beached our ship. Unloading\nthe sheep, we made our way beside the stream of Ocean\nuntil we reached the place of which Kirke had told us.\nThere Perimedes and Eurylochos held the victims,\nwhile I unsheathed the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\nand dug out a pit, about a cubit deep and wide,\nand around it poured a libation to all the dead—\nfirst with milk and honey, then with sweet wine,\nand thirdly with water: I sprinkled white barley in it,\nbesought the weak heads of the dead with many vows—\nthat when I was back on Ithake I’d sacrifice the best\nbarren heifer in my domain, load the pyre with good things,\nand, for Teiresias only, would offer a sacrifice\nof an all-black ram, the finest one in my flocks.\nThen, when with vows and prayers I’d made my entreaties\nto the tribes of the dead, I took the sheep, cut their throats\nover the pit. The dark blood flowed, there came up out\nfrom Erebos the shades of corpses dead and buried:\nbrides, still-unmarried youths, toil-worn old men,\ntender young girls, their hearts still new to sorrow,\nand many with wounds inflicted by bronze-tipped spears,\nmen slain while fighting, still in their bloodstained armor—\nmany crowding around the pit from every quarter\nwith an eerie clamor. Pale fear took possession of me.\nBut still I called my companions, gave them orders to take\nthe sheep that lay there, slain by the ruthless bronze,\nand flay and burn them, along with prayers to the gods—\nstrong Hades and holy Persephone. I myself,\nunsheathing the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\nsat there, and would not allow the weak heads of the dead\nto come near the blood until I’d questioned Teiresias.\n“The first shade to come was that of my comrade Elpenor.\nNot yet had he been interred beneath the wide-traveled earth,\nfor we’d left his body behind in Kirke’s hall, unwept\nand unburied, since this other business was what now drove us.\nOn seeing him I wept, and my heart felt pity for him,\nand speaking with winged words, I addressed him, saying:\n‘Elpenor, how did you come here through the murky darkness?\nYou traveled faster on foot than I in my black ship.’\n“So I spoke. He groaned, and responded to me, saying:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\nsome god’s ill-will undid me—that, and too much wine!\nWhen I lay down to sleep in Kirke’s house I forgot\nI must make my way back down by the long ladder,\nso fell headlong off the roof: my neck was snapped through\nat the spine; my shade went down to Hades’ realm.\nNow I beseech you, by those left behind who are not here,\nby your wife, by the father who cared for you as an infant,\nby Telemachos, whom you left as the sole child in your halls—\nI know when you go on from here, leave the realm of Hades,\nyou’ll put in, with your well-built ship, at the isle of Aiaia.\nIt’s there, my lord, that I need your remembrance most—\nDon’t abandon me there unwept, unburied, lest I\nbecome the occasion of some god’s wrath against you!\nBurn me there, I beg you, with such armor as I possess,\nand heap me a burial mound by the shore of the grey sea,\nfor those yet unborn to learn of an unfortunate man.\nDo this for me, and set on my tomb the oar\nwith which I rowed, when alive, among my comrades.’\n“So he spoke, and I then answered him, saying: ‘All this,\nunhappy man, I’ll most surely carry out on your behalf.’\n“So the two of us sat there, exchanging these grim words,\nI on one side with my sword held over the blood,\non the other, addressing me, the wraith of my companion.\n“Then there drew near the ghost of my dead mother,\nAntikleia, daughter of great-hearted Autolykos,\nwhom I’d left alive when I first sailed for sacred Ilion.\nOn seeing her I wept, and pitied her in my heart;\nYet not even so, for all my deep sorrow, would I\nlet her come near the blood till I’d questioned Teiresias.\nAnd then he came, did the ghost of Theban Teiresias,\ngold staff in hand, and he recognized and addressed me:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\nwhy, hapless man, have you turned your back on the sunlight\nand come to gaze on the dead and their joyless region?\nStand back from the pit, and take your sharp sword away,\nso I can drink of the blood, and speak words of truth to you.’\n“So he spoke, and I drew back, returning my silver-studded\nsword to its sheath; only when he’d drunk the dark blood\ndid the matchless seer address me, saying: ‘Great Odysseus,\nyou want to know all about your sweet homecoming.\nThis a god will make hard for you: I do not foresee\nyou escaping the Earth-Shaker’s notice. He holds a grudge\nagainst you, is wrathful because you blinded his dear son.\nYet even so you can make it, though after much hardship,\nif you’re willing to curb your own and your comrades’ spirits\nfrom the moment you put in with your well-built ship,\nforsaking the violet deep, to the isle of Thrinakie\nand find there at pasture the cattle and well-fed sheep\nof Helios, the all-seeing, all-hearing sun. If you\nleave these unharmed and take care over your return\nyou may still get home to Ithake, after much suffering;\nbut should you harm them, then I foresee destruction\nfor your ship and your comrades. You yourself may escape,\nbut you’ll get home late and in bad shape, your comrades all lost,\nin a ship not your own, find troubles plaguing your house—\narrogant fellows installed there, devouring your livelihood,\nwooing your godlike wife and sending her bridal gifts!\nIndeed, when you come you’ll avenge their violent conduct,\nbut when you’ve killed off the suitors in your halls,\nwhether by guile or openly with the sharp bronze,\nthen you must set out again, taking a well-shaped oar,\nuntil you come among men who know nothing of the sea,\nwho eat their food without putting salt in it,\nand have never set eyes on ships with purple cheeks\nor on the well-shaped oars that serve as a ship’s wings;\nand I’ll tell you a very clear sign, one that won’t escape you:\nwhen on the road you meet another man who believes\nit’s a winnowing-fan that you have on your sturdy shoulder,\nthen fix your well-shaped oar on end in the ground,\nand offer a lavish sacrifice to the lord Poseidon—\na ram, a bull, and a stud boar that mounts its sows.\nThen go back home, and make rich sacred offerings\nto the immortal gods who possess broad heaven,\nin due order. Death will come to you from the sea,\nthe gentlest of ends, but will take you only after\nyou’ve worn out a sleek old age, with your people round you\nprospering. This that I tell you is the truth.’\n“So he spoke, and I then responded to him, saying:\n‘Teiresias, it may be that the gods have spun this thread.\nBut come, now tell me this, and answer me truthfully:\nI see before me the shade of my departed mother,\nsitting, silent, close to the blood. I am her own son,\nyet she’s not brought herself to look at me or address me!\nTell me, my lord, how may she know me for who I am?’\n“So I spoke, and at once he responded to me, saying:\n‘Very simple the answer I’ll give you and put in your mind:\nWhosoever of those that are dead and gone you permit\nto come up to the blood will converse with you truthfully;\nbut any that you refuse will go back to where they came from.’\n“So saying, the ghost of the lord Teiresias departed\nback to Hades’ domain, after stating the gods’ decrees;\nbut I waited steadfastly there, until my mother\ncame up and drank the dark blood, and knew me at once,\nand addressed me sorrowfully, with winged words, saying:\n‘My child, how did you penetrate this murky darkness\nwhile alive? Hard for the living to get to see these realms,\nfor between them lie great rivers, awesome streams,\nOcean above all, which may in no wise be crossed\non foot, but only with a well-found ship! Have your\nlong wanderings after Troy still brought you no further\nthan this with your ship and your comrades? Haven’t you yet\nreached Ithake, or seen your wife and your own domain?’\n“So she spoke, and I then responded to her, saying:\n‘My mother, need brought me down here to Hades’ realm:\nI had to consult the shade of Theban Teiresias.\nNot yet have I come near Achaia, not yet have I set foot\non my own land, I’ve been wandering, grief-stricken,\nsince I first followed the godlike lord Agamemnon\nto Ilion, home of fine horses, to fight against the Trojans.\nBut now tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\nWhat fated exit of death was it overcame you?\nSome wasting disease? Or did Artemis the archer\nwith her gentle shafts assail you and lay you low?\nTell me, too, of the father and son I left behind there—\nAre my privileges still with them, or does some other\nman now possess them? Do they say I’ll not return?\nAnd what of my wedded wife? Her thoughts? Her plans?\nHas she held on with her son? Kept everything as it was?\nOr is she now remarried, to the best man of the Achaians?’\n“So I spoke, and my lady mother answered me at once:\n‘Truly indeed she holds on with steadfast spirit\nthere in your halls: for her the nights and days\nwaste away in unending sorrow amid her tears.\nAs for your fine privileges, no man’s assumed them, although\nTelemachos now, unchallenged, possesses your acres,\nand orders the common feasts, as is right for a lawgiver\nwhom all men acknowledge. But your father stays away\nin the country, and never comes into town. He has\nno bed with proper bedclothes, rugs and bright coverlets,\nbut sleeps in winter along with the slaves in the house,\nin the ashes close to the fire, and wears old ragged clothes.\nBut when summer comes, and flourishing autumn, then\nall over the rising slope of his vine-clad orchard\nthe ground is strewn with the fallen leaves for his bed.\nThere he lies in his sorrow, heart nursing one great grief,\nyearning for your return: old age weighs heavy on him.\nThus it was that I too perished and met my fate:\nNeither in our abode did the deadly archer goddess\nlay me low in a visitation with her gentle shafts,\nnor did any disease come upon me, the kind most likely\nwith loathsome wasting to sever the spirit from my limbs:\nit was rather my yearning for you, illustrious Odysseus,\nfor your wisdom, your kindness, that robbed me of sweet life.’\n“So she spoke, and I wanted, pondering in my heart,\nto embrace the ghost of my mother, now dead and gone:\nthree times I moved to clasp her, as my heart urged me,\nthree times she eluded my arms, like some shadow or dream,\nso that the pain in my heart grew ever sharper,\nand I spoke, addressed her with winged words, saying: ‘Mother,\nwhy won’t you stay here when I want to hold you,\nso that even in Hades the two of us can cast arms\nabout one another, and get our fill of chill lamentation?\nIs this some phantom set on me by holy Persephone\nto add yet more to the weight of my grief and sorrow?’\n“So I spoke, and my lady mother answered me at once:\n‘Alas, my child, ill-fated beyond all other mortals,\nPersephone, daughter of Zeus, is in no way beguiling you.\nNo, this is the fixed law for mortals, when anyone dies:\nThe sinews no longer keep flesh and bones together,\nthey’re destroyed by the powerful force of blazing fire\nas soon as the spirit departs from the white bones\nand the soul, like a dream, flies fluttering off, is gone.\nBut quick, hurry back to the light now, with all these things\nstored in your mind, to tell your wife hereafter.’\n“So we two conversed together, and now the women\napproached us, those sent up by holy Persephone,\nall those who had been great chieftains’ wives or daughters.\nIn throngs now they all gathered around the dark blood\nwhile I considered how I should question each individual.\nAnd this, to my mind, emerged as the best plan:\nI drew the long sword from beside my sturdy thigh\nand would not let them all drink the dark blood together.\nSo they approached me in turn, one after the other.\nEach told me her lineage. I interrogated them all.\n“Now the first one that I saw there was high-born Tyro,\nwho said she was descended from peerless Salmoneus,\nand declared herself the wife of Aiolos’ son Kretheus.\nShe fell in love with divine Enipeus, the river,\nloveliest of all rivers that discharge their streams on earth,\nand she used to haunt Enipeus’ beautiful waters.\nAssuming Enipeus’ form, the Earth-Shaking Earth-Supporter\nlay with her at the outflow of the eddying river,\nand the dark wave stood up round them like a mountain,\narching over, concealing the god and the mortal woman.\nHe undid her virgin sash, shed sleep down on her,\nthen, when the god had completed the actions of love,\nhe clasped her hand and addressed her, saying: ‘Lady,\nbe glad of this lovemaking! As the time of the year comes round\nyou will bear fine offspring: not issueless are the couplings\nof the immortals! Look after these children, raise them.\nFor now, though, go back home, keep quiet, say nothing.\nBut know that I am Poseidon, the Earth-Shaker!’\n“So saying,\nhe plunged down into the billowing deep. And she\nindeed conceived, gave birth to Pelias and to Neleus,\nwho grew to become strong henchmen of mighty Zeus,\nboth of them: Pelias dwelt in Iolkos’ broad terrain,\nwith a wealth of flocks, and Neleus in sandy Pylos.\nOther sons this queen among women bore to Kretheus:\nAison, Pheres, Amythaon the joyful chariot fighter.\n“After her I saw Antiope, daughter of Asopos,\nwho boasted that she’d slept in the arms of Zeus himself,\nand bore him twin sons, Amphion and Zethos, who\nfirst laid the foundations of seven-gated Thebai,\nand walled it about, since lacking walls they could not\ndwell in broad-landed Thebai, powerful though they were.\n“After her I saw Alkmene, Amphitryon’s bedfellow,\nshe who conceived Herakles—bold fighter, lion-hearted—\nwhen she embraced and coupled with mighty Zeus.\nMegare too I saw, high-spirited Kreion’s daughter,\nwife to Amphitryon’s son, a man of unwearied strength.\n“Oedipus’ mother I saw, the beautiful Epikaste,\nwho unwittingly did a most terrible deed: she married\nher own son: he wed her after killing his father.\nStraightaway the gods revealed all this to mankind.\nYet he in his much-loved Thebai, though racked with grief,\nby the gods’ grim design still reigned over the Kadmeians,\nwhile she went down to the realm of Hades, strong gatekeeper,\nafter hanging a sheer noose from the lofty ceiling,\npossessed by her grief, bequeathing him countless woes,\nall that a mother’s Furies might bring to pass.\n“And I saw\nthe exquisite Chloris, that woman whom Neleus once\nwed for her looks, when he’d brought her endless bridal gifts;\nyoungest daughter she was of Amphion, Iasos’ son—\nwho once in Minyan Orchomenos ruled with a forceful hand—\nand queen of Pylos too: she bore him illustrious children:\nNestor and Chromios, Periklymenos the much-honored,\nand besides these she bore gorgeous Pero, a wonder to mortals.\nHer all the men living round sought in marriage. But Neleus\nwould bestow her on him alone who drove from Phylake\nthe broad-browed crumple-horned cattle of powerful Iphikles—\na hard lot they were, and none but the matchless seer\nundertook to drive them off; but a hard fate set by the god\nhampered him: that, and tough shackles, and those country cowherds.\nNevertheless, when the months and days were completed\nof the circling year, and the seasons in turn came round,\nhe was let go by powerful Iphikles, once he’d told him\nall the divine decrees. And a plan of Zeus was fulfilled.\n“Lede also I saw, the bedfellow of Tyndareus,\nwho bore to Tyndareus a pair of stout-hearted sons,\nhorse-breaker Kastor and Polydeukes the skilled boxer.\nBoth these, though living, the life-giving earth enfolds:\neven beneath the earth they have honor from Zeus—\nin turn, on alternate days, they live and are dead.\nThe honors bestowed upon them match those of the gods.\n“After her I saw Iphimedeia, Aloeus’ bedfellow,\nwho claimed she’d coupled in passion with Poseidon.\nTwo sons she bore, but both of them were short-lived:\nOtos, a match for a god, and far-famed Ephialtes,\nwho were the tallest men that this grain-rich earth yet bred,\nand the best-looking by far after renowned Orion.\nAt nine years old they measured a full nine cubits\nin breadth, and were nine fathoms tall. They even\nmade threats against the immortals on Olympos,\nthat they’d start up the conflict of impetuous warfare!\nOssa they longed to pile on Olympos, and on Ossa\nleaf-rippling Pelion, to scale the heights of heaven!\nAnd this they’d have done, had they come to full adulthood;\nBut the son of Zeus, whom neat-haired Leto bore, slew them:\nboth of them—this before the down grew beneath their temples,\nor covered their chins with a thick and healthy stubble.\n“And Phaidre and Prokris I saw, and beautiful Ariadne,\nbloody-minded Minos’ daughter, whom Theseus once\nbrought out of Krete to take to the hill of sacred Athens,\nbut had no joy of her, since before that Artemis slew her\non sea-girt Die, because of Dionysos’ indictment.\n“Maira I saw, and Klymene, and loathsome Eriphyle,\nwho took precious gold in exchange for her own husband—\nBut I neither can tell of nor name all the women I saw,\nthe wives and daughters of heroes; long before that\nthe immortal night would be gone. Now is the time\nfor sleep—either going aboard your swift ship to its crew\nor here. My conveyance will be the gods’ concern, and yours.”\nSo he spoke: every one of them sat hushed and silent,\nenthralled by his words, throughout the shadowy hall.\nWhite-armed Arete was the first to comment, saying:\n“Phaiakians, how does this man’s character strike you?\nHis looks, his stature, his equable inner mind?\nBesides, he’s my guest, though you all share that honor:\nSo don’t rush to send him away, or to cut short our gifts\nto one in such need; you have plentiful possessions\nstored in your halls through the good will of the gods.”\nThen there spoke up among them the old hero Echeneos,\nthe most aged of all the Phaiakian elders, saying:\n“My friends, not wide of the mark or of our own thinking\nis what our wise queen just said: pay attention to it—\nthough it’s on Alkinoos here that both word and deed depend.”\nAlkinoos then responded to him, saying: “Her words\nshall indeed hold good, just as surely as I am alive\nand lord over all the Phaiakians, those lovers of the oar!\nBut let our guest, despite his yearning to get back home,\nbear to stay till tomorrow, until I can render all\nour gift-giving complete. His conveyance shall be the concern\nof all men, but mine above all, since I hold the power here.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Lordly Alkinoos, exalted above all people, should you\nask me to stay on here for a whole year, prior to\norganizing my conveyance, and giving me splendid gifts,\nthat too would I accept: it would profit me far more\nto return with a fuller hand to my own country: then\nI would get a warmer and more respectful welcome\nfrom all men who saw that I’d come home to Ithake.”\nAlkinoos then responded to him, saying: “Odysseus,\non looking at you, indeed we do not suppose\nthat you’re the kind of cheat or trickster that’s bred\nby the black earth in large numbers, itinerant men\nwho fashion false tales from what no man could really see!\nBut you have a way with words and an excellent mind,\nand you told your tale skillfully, just as a minstrel does:\nthe grim troubles of all the Argives, and your own.\nBut come, tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\nDid you see any of those—your godlike comrades—\nwho went out to Ilion with you, and met their end there?\nThe night before us is long, near endless, it’s not yet time\nfor sleep in the hall. Tell me more of your marvelous story!\nI could hold out till bright dawn, if you’d only endure\nto continue the tale of your troubles, here in the hall.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Lord Alkinoos, exalted above all people, there’s\na time for long stories, and a time for sleep. But if\nyou’re still eager to listen, I wouldn’t begrudge you\nthe telling of other matters yet more piteous than these—\nthe troubles of my companions, who perished later,\nafter escaping the Trojans’ grim battle cry: they died\non the way home, through a wicked woman’s will.\n“After holy Persephone scattered the female souls\nof the women hither and thither, in all directions,\nthere came up the ghost of Atreus’ son Agamemnon,\ngrieving; and round him clustered the ghosts of all those\nwho’d died and met their fate with him in Aigisthos’ house.\nHe knew me at once, as soon as he’d drunk the dark blood:\nhe was weeping aloud, and shedding big tears. He stretched\nhis hands out toward me, eager to reach and touch me,\nbut no longer did he have strength or vigor remaining\nin his limbs as once, when they were live and supple.\n“When I saw him I wept, and pitied him in my heart,\nand spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n‘Most renowned son of Atreus, Agamemnon king of men,\nwhat fate of long-grief-giving death was it overcame you?\nWas it Poseidon destroyed you aboard your vessels\nby stirring up the dread blast of hard-blowing gales?\nOr did hostile men work your destruction on dry land\nwhen you were lifting their cattle and fine fleecy sheep\nor fighting them for their city and for their women?’\n“So I spoke; and he at once responded to me, saying:\n‘Scion of Zeus, Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\nneither did Poseidon destroy me aboard my ships\nby stirring up the dread blast of hard-blowing gales,\nnor did hostile men work my destruction on dry land:\nAigisthos it was fixed my death and destiny, slew me—\nhe, with my damnable wife—as a guest in his house\nfor dinner, the way one slaughters an ox at its manger.\nSo I died a most piteous death, and round me all my comrades\nwere killed without mercy, like so many white-tusked hogs\nin the house of a wealthy and highly powerful man\nfor a wedding or communal feast, or some sumptuous banquet.\nBefore now you’ll have witnessed the killing of many men,\nslain in single combat or the violent crush of battle,\nbut this sight would have stirred the most pity in your heart—\nhow all about the mixing bowl and the laden tables\nwe lay in that hall, and the whole floor swam with blood.\nThe most piteous cry I heard was that of Priam’s daughter\nKassandre, murdered by treacherous Klytaimnestra\nas she clung to me. I, fallen, raised my arms in self-defense\nand, dying, flung them about the sword. That bitch\nturned her back, could not be bothered, though I was on\nmy way to Hades, to close my eyes or my gaping mouth.\nThere’s nothing more frightful or shameless than a woman\nwho conceives the idea of such misdeeds in her heart,\nlike the horrifying act that this woman planned, contriving\nher own wedded husband’s murder. I honestly believed\nthat my return home would be welcomed by my children\nand household. But she, mind set upon utter evil,\nhas brought shame both on herself and on women yet unborn—\nthe whole female sex, even those of faultless conduct.’\n“So he spoke, and I then responded to him, saying:\n‘Alas, far-seeing Zeus has nursed a fearsome hatred\nagainst Atreus’ whole line, by means of women’s wiles,\nfrom the start: for Helen’s sake large numbers of us died,\nand Klytaimnestra ensnared you when you were far away.’\n“So I spoke. He at once responded to me, saying:\n‘That’s why you should never go easy, even with your wife!\nDon’t tell her every thought you have in your head:\nTell her some only, keep the rest of them well hidden!\nStill, your own death, Odysseus, will not come from your wife:\nthoroughly sensible, her mind full of virtuous thoughts\nis Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelope, whom we left\nbehind there as a bride, a young wife lately wed,\nwhen we went off to the war: she had a child at the breast,\na baby son, who now must sit numbered among the men\nand is lucky, for his own father will return and see him,\nand the boy will embrace his father, as is right and proper.\nBut that bedfellow of mine did not even let me feast\nmy eyes on my son: before that she’d murdered me.\nAnother thing, too, I’ll tell you, and you lay it to heart:\nIn secret, not openly, hold your vessel on her course\nto your native shore: no more is there faith in women.\nBut come, tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\nHave you heard any news of my son, that he’s still alive\nin Orchomenos maybe, or out at sandy Pylos\nor perhaps with Menelaos in broad Sparta?—for not yet\nhas any place on this earth witnessed noble Orestes’ death.’\n“So he spoke, and I then responded to him, saying:\n‘Son of Atreus, why ask me this? I have no knowledge\nof whether he’s dead or alive. Empty guesses are pointless.’\n“While we two stood together exchanging grim words,\nwith lamentation, and shedding many big tears,\nthere came up the ghost of Peleus’ son Achilles,\nand those of Patroklos, and of peerless Antilochos,\nand Aias, unmatched for handsomeness and stature\namong all the Danaans save for Peleus’ peerless son.\nThe ghost of Aiakos’ swift-footed grandson knew me,\nand sorrowfully addressed me with winged words, saying:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\nrash man, what yet greater deed will your mind think up?\nHow dared you come down to Hades, where reside\nthe mindless dead, the phantoms of outworn mortals?’\n“So he spoke; and I then responded to him, saying:\n‘Achilles, Peleus’ son, most valiant of the Achaians,\nI came out of need for Teiresias, if maybe he could tell me\nsome plan that would get me home to rugged Ithake.\nNot yet have I come near Achaia, not yet have I set foot\non my own land, but have endless trouble. No man, Achilles,\nwas more blest than you in the past, nor shall be hereafter;\nfor while you were living we Argives honored you equally\nwith the gods; and now you’re here you exercise great power\nover the dead. Your death is no cause for grief, Achilles.’\n“So I spoke. He at once responded to me, saying:\n‘Don’t talk up death to me, illustrious Odysseus!\nI’d rather work as a field hand, a hireling, for some other\nlandless man who could just scrape a livelihood together\nthan be lord over all the corpses who’ve ever perished!\nBut come, tell me the news about that fine son of mine—\nhas he gone off to war, and made it as champion, or not?\nAnd have you had any news about Peleus? If so, tell me—\nIs he still honored among the mass of the Myrmidons?\nOr do they show him no honor throughout Hellas and Phthie\nnow that old age has crippled him, hand and foot,\nand I’m no longer there to help him, out in the sunlight,\nor strong, as once I was in the wide terrain of Troy\nwhen I slew the best of their men while defending the Argives?\nIf I could come thus, only briefly, to my father’s house\nthen I’d make my strength and invincible hands most bitter\nto any who show him violence and diminish his honor.’\n“So he spoke, and I then responded to him, saying:\n‘In fact I’ve heard no news regarding flawless Peleus,\nbut about your dear son Neoptolemos I’ll tell you\nthe whole truth, as you requested. I fetched him myself\naboard my trim hollow vessel, brought him out\nfrom Skyros to join the ranks of the well-greaved Achaians.\nAnd when we were planning action around the city of Troy\nhe was always the first to speak, had never a bad idea:\ngodlike Nestor and I alone came up with better ones.\nWhenever we fought with the bronze out on the Trojan plain\nhe’d never hold back among the main body of our troops,\nbut was always far out ahead, unrivaled in prowess,\nand many the men he slaughtered in fearsome battle.\nI couldn’t recount or name all the victims he slew,\nall the many men he dispatched when fighting for the Argives—\nbut one great man, Telephos’ son, he felled with the bronze:\nthe hero Eurypylos, and with him a crowd of his Keteian\ncomrades all perished because of a woman’s gifts.\nNo handsomer man I ever saw, except noble Memnon.\nAnd when we, the best of the Argives, were going into\nthe Horse that Epeios made, all under my command—\nwhen to wait, when we should spring our close-built ambush—\nthen the other Danaan chieftains and counselors\nhad to wipe away tears, the limbs of all were trembling,\nyet him I never once noticed with my own eyes\ndabbing the tears from his cheeks, or his handsome features\nlosing their color; he kept on pleading with me\nto let him out from the Horse, his hand was always\non his sword hilt or bronze-heavy spear, impatient to get at\nthe Trojans. But when we’d sacked the steep citadel of Priam,\nhe boarded his ship with a good prize-share of the booty—\nand all unscathed, neither pierced by the sharp bronze\nnor cut up in close combat, as so often happens\nto men during battle: Ares rages in wild confusion.’\n“So I spoke. The ghost of Aiakos’ swift-footed grandson\nmade off with long strides across the asphodel meadow,\nhappy because I told him his son had distinguished himself.\n“The remaining shades of those who were dead and gone\nstood sadly there, all asking about their own concerns;\nof all of them, only the shade of Aias, Telamon’s son,\nstood apart from the rest, still enraged by the victory\nI’d won over him when we two competed by the ships\nfor Achilles’ arms, a prize set up by his lady mother\nwith the sons of the Trojans and Pallas Athene as judges.\nWould that I’d never won the contest for such a prize,\nsince over so rare a head the earth closed because of it—\nthat of Aias, whose beauty and deeds done outshone those\nof all other Danaans save for Peleus’ peerless son.\nTo him I now spoke with words of conciliation: ‘Aias,\ngreat Telamon’s son, could you not, then, even in death,\nabandon the wrath I roused in you over those fatal\narms, surely used by the gods to grieve the Argives,\nsuch a tower of strength they lost in you! The Achaians\nstill ceaselessly mourn your death, as they do the lost life\nof Achilles, Peleus’ son. Yet no one’s more to blame\nthan Zeus, with that terrible hatred he nursed against\nthe army of Danaan spearmen: this it was that doomed you.\nCome close to me, lord, and listen to what I have to tell you!\nOvermaster your great fury, your arrogant spirit!’\n“So I spoke, but he made me no answer, went after the other\nshades of the dead and departed to Erebos. Nevertheless\nhe might still, despite his wrath, have addressed me, or I him,\nbut the spirit within this breast of mine was still eager\nto see the shades of those others now dead and gone.\n“Thereafter I saw Minos, Zeus’ illustrious son,\nholding a golden scepter, sitting in judgment over\nthe dead, as they, sitting or standing, brought each case\nbefore their lord, in Hades’ wide-gated realm.\n“After him I became aware of gigantic Orion,\nherding and driving across the meadows of asphodel\nthe wild beasts he’d killed himself on the lonely mountains,\nwith a club of bronze in his hands, forever unbroken.\n“Tityos too I saw, Gaia’s illustrious offspring,\nlying on the ground, spread over nine whole acres,\na vulture on either side of him tearing at his liver\nand pecking into his guts; he’d no hands to beat them off\nafter forcing himself on Leto, Zeus’ famed bedfellow,\nin broad-lawned Panopeus, on her way to Pytho.\n“I also saw Tantalos suffering painful torment,\nas he stood in a pool, the water lapping his chin:\nhe was maddened with thirst, yet couldn’t ever reach it,\nfor whenever the old fellow bent down to drink\nthe water was sucked down and vanished, and around\nhis feet the black earth appeared, dried up by some god.\nTrees too, high and leafy, hung top-heavy with fruit—\npears, pomegranates, boughs laden with shining apples,\nsweet figs, a profusion of olives. But every time\nthe old man reached out to grasp them, a gust of wind\nwould whirl them aloft toward the shadowy clouds.\n“I also saw Sisyphos suffering most painful torment,\nas he labored to raise a huge stone with his two bare hands:\nscrambling with hands and feet he’d try to push it\nup to the crest of the hill; but when he was on the point\nof getting it over the top, its weight would defeat him:\nbumpity back to the plain the shameless stone would clatter.\nYet he kept straining and heaving, while the sweat streamed down\nfrom his limbs, and the dust rose swirling around his head.\n“After him I became aware of powerful Herakles,\n[his phantom, for he himself among the immortal gods\ntakes joy in the feast, and has the elegant-ankled Hebe,\nchild of great Zeus and the golden-sandaled Here:]\naround him arose a bird like clamor from the dead\nas they scattered in terror, while he, as dark as night,\nholding a bare bow with an arrow at the string,\nkept glancing sharply round him, as though about to shoot.\nA fearsome thing was the baldric girding his torso,\na belt of gold on which wondrous objects had been fashioned—\nbears and wild boars, and lions with glinting eyes,\nand fights and battles and murder and the slayings of men.\nMay he never have crafted, or again craft, another such,\nthe man who stamped that belt with his special craftsmanship!\nHerakles recognized me the moment he saw me,\nand sorrowfully addressed me with winged words, saying:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\npoor wretch, are you leading the kind of grim existence\nsuch as I too bore beneath the rays of the sun?\nI was Kronos’ son Zeus’ offspring, and yet I suffered\nwoes beyond measure, for I was placed in subjection\nto a man far worse man than myself, who laid hard labors on me.\nHe even once sent me here to get Hades’ hound: he could think\nof no harder labor for me than this. Yet that hound I did\nindeed carry off and bring up out of Hades—\nI had Hermes and grey-eyed Athene serving as my guides.’\n“So saying, he went on his way, back into Hades’ realm,\nbut I remained firmly there, in case there might come up\nany more of the heroes who’d perished so long ago;\nand I might indeed have seen men of old whom I wanted to—\nTheseus, Peirithoos, famed progeny of the gods—\nbut before that, great swarms of the dead came thronging up\nwith loud eerie cries, and pale terror gripped me, the fear\nthat the head of the Gorgon, that ghastly monster, might\nbe sent against me from Hades by holy Persephone.\n“So at once I went back to the ship, and ordered my comrades\nto embark again themselves, and cast off the stern warps.\nSo they came aboard quickly, and sat down on the benches,\nand the current bore the ship fast down Ocean’s river,\nhelped first by our rowing, and then by a following wind.”\n",

         "\n“After our ship left the course of Ocean’s river and came\nto the swelling waves of the wide-tracked sea, and the isle\nof Aiaia, where is the abode of Dawn, the early riser,\nand her dancing floors, and the risings of Helios the sun,\nthen we beached our vessel, hauled her up on the sands,\nand ourselves disembarked on the seashore. There we fell\nasleep, and stayed thus, awaiting the bright dawn.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nI sent my companions off to Kirke’s domain\nto bring back the body of the deceased Elpenor.\nNext we cut wood for his pyre and at the seaward tip\nof the headland held his funeral, mourning and shedding tears.\nThen after his corpse was burned—along with its armor—\nWe heaped up a burial mound, raised a marker on it,\nand on top of the tomb set up his well-shaped oar.\n“So we busied ourselves with these matters, nor was Kirke\nunaware that we’d got back from Hades: very promptly\nshe readied herself, and came out. The handmaids with her\nbrought bread and much meat, and tawny-red wine, and she,\nbright among goddesses, now spoke in the midst of us, saying:\n‘Foolhardy men, who went down to Hades’ realm alive,\nand met death twice, when others die only the once!\nBut come now, you’ve food to eat and wine to drink\nthe whole day through! Then, at the coming of Dawn,\nyou’ll set sail. I’ll show you your route and brief you\non every detail. That way, no ruinous bad decisions,\nat sea or ashore, will leave you in desperate trouble.’\n“So she spoke: the proud spirit in us was persuaded.\nThe whole day long, then, till sunset we sat feasting\non abundant meat and sweet wine; but when the sun\nwent down, and darkness came on, then all the others\nlay down to sleep beside the ship’s stern warps;\nbut me Kirke took by the hand, led apart from my comrades,\nmade me sit down, then questioned me in detail,\nand I told her the whole story, just as it happened.\nThereupon the lady Kirke spoke at length to me, saying:\n‘All that, then, has been accomplished. Now listen to what\nI shall tell you: the god himself will remind you of it.\nFirst off, you’ll come to the Sirens. They bewitch\nand beguile all mortals who come within earshot of them.\nAny man who unwittingly gets close enough to hear\nthe Sirens’ voices will never again be surrounded\nby wife and children greeting him on his return home;\nthe Sirens will enchant him with their clear high singing\nas they sit in a meadow, among great heaps of bones\nfrom men’s rotted bodies, the skin on them all shriveled.\nRow on past them, and stop up the ears of your comrades\nwith beeswax—soften it first—so none of them can hear.\nBut as for yourself, if you’re determined to listen,\nhave them tie you, hand and foot, while upright, against\nyour swift ship’s mast, in its step, with rope ends lashed\nto the mast itself, so you can hear and enjoy the Sirens.\nBut if you beg and command your comrades to release you,\nthey are then to bind you more firmly with yet more bonds!\nThen, when your comrades have rowed you beyond the Sirens,\nfrom that point on, I’ll no longer tell you in full detail\nwhich course is the one to follow, but you yourself\nmust make up your mind. I shall give you two options.\nOn the one side are crags, overhanging, and against them\ncrash the great breakers of dark-eyed Amphitrite:\nthese crags the blessed gods call the Wandering Rocks.\nThat way not even winged creatures go, not even the shy\ndoves that carry ambrosia to Zeus the Father: the smooth-\nworn rock always snatches one at least of these away,\nand the Father sends in another to restore the numbers.\nNo mortal vessel that tried it has ever got past those rocks—\nship’s timbers and human bodies are both together\ncarried off by the waves and gusts of destructive fire—\nsave that one seafaring vessel which alone escaped them:\nArgo, of worldwide fame, sailing home from Aietes—\nand she too would soon have been slammed into those great crags\nhad Here not steered her safe through, out of love for Jason.\n‘Next are the two headlands. One of them towers up\nto broad heaven, with a sharp peak. Dark clouds surround it,\nthat never disperse: its summit never enjoys clear air,\nnot even in spring or autumn. There’s not a man alive\ncould scale that peak or set foot on its crest, not even\nwere he endowed with a score of hands and feet,\nfor the rock is as smooth as though it had been polished.\nHalfway up this headland there’s a murky cavern\nfacing west, toward the dusk and Erebos. It’s that way\nyou should steer your hollow ship, illustrious Odysseus,\nfrom which hollow ship not even the strongest man\ncould shoot an arrow up into that cave’s interior.\nThere, in it, dwells Skylle, yelping most fearsomely;\nHer voice may be only as loud as that of a newborn puppy,\nbut she is an evil monster, the sight of whom would please\nnobody, were it even a god who encountered her.\nA dozen legs she has, all waving in the air,\nand six necks, very lengthy, and on every one of them\na horrible head, with three rows of teeth in each,\nclose-set and crowded, all full of black death. From below\nthe waist her body is hidden inside the hollow cavern,\nbut her heads she stretches out from that fearsome abyss\nand goes fishing there, searches all around the rock face\nfor dolphin or dogfish or whatever larger creature\nshe can catch of the thousands loud Amphitrite breeds.\nPast her no sailors yet can boast of having voyaged\nunharmed, for with each of her heads she carries off\na man that she snatches out of his dark-prowed vessel.\n‘But the other headland, Odysseus, as you’ll see, is lower—\nthe two are close together, within easy bowshot—\nand on it grows a great fig tree with luxuriant foliage.\nBeneath this divine Charybdis sucks in the dark water—\nthrice daily she spews it out upward, thrice sucks it all back\nwith fearsome effect—may you never be there then!\nNot even the Earth-Shaker could save you from destruction.\nRather hold course close to Skylle’s headland and quickly\nsteer your ship past it, since it’s far preferable\nto lose six of your crew than for all of you to perish.’\n“So she spoke, and I then responded to her, saying:\n‘Come, I beg you, goddess. Tell me this truthfully: Is there\nany way I can both get clear of deadly Charybdis\nand stop the other, when she tries to snatch my comrades?’\n“So I spoke, and she, bright among goddesses, snapped back:\n‘Foolhardy man, once again you’re set on deeds of warfare\nand hardship! Will you not yield even to the immortal\ngods? Because she’s not mortal, but an immortal evil,\ndread, disastrous, wild—and not to be fought with,\nfor there’s no defense—best course is to flee from her.\nFor if you linger to arm yourself beside her rock\nI fear she may once again dart out and assault you\nwith as many heads, and seize as many men as before.\nSo row past at speed, while calling upon Krataiis,\nSkylle’s mother, who bore her to be a bane to mortals:\nshe then will stop her from making that second assault.\n‘So you’ll come to the isle of Thrinakie. There at pasture\nare Helios’ numerous cattle and well-fed flocks:\nseven herds of oxen, and as many fine flocks of sheep,\nwith fifty head in each herd. They never bear young,\nnor do they ever grow old. They’re tended by goddesses,\nfair-tressed nymphs, Phaethousa and Lampetie,\nwhom resplendent Neaira bore to Hyperion Helios.\nThese their lady mother, when she’d borne and reared them,\nsent out to the isle of Thrinakie, to a distant life\ntending their father’s flocks and crumple-horned cattle.\nIf you leave these unharmed and take care over your return\nyou may still get home to Ithake, after much suffering;\nbut should you harm them, then I foresee destruction\nfor your ship and your comrades. You yourself may escape,\nthough you’ll get home late, in bad shape, your comrades all lost.’\n“So she spoke, and then, golden-throned, the Dawn came up.\nShe, bright among goddesses, departed up the island,\nwhile I went back to the ship and aroused my comrades\nto embark themselves and to cast off the stern warps;\nthey came aboard quickly and sat down at the benches,\nand in good order struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\nIn the wake of our dark-prowed ship a following breeze\nthat filled our sail, a trusty companion, was sent us\nby fair-tressed Kirke, dread goddess of mortal speech.\nSo when we’d secured the tackle throughout the ship\nwe sat down: wind and steersman now kept her on her course.\n“Then I finally, grieving at heart, addressed my comrades:\n‘Friends, since it’s not right that one or two only should know\nthe gods’ decrees that Kirke, bright among goddesses, told me,\nI shall now relate them to you: it will be in that knowledge\nthat we either die or escape, sidestepping death and fate.\nFirst, the heavenly Sirens. She bids us keep well away\nfrom them, their singing, and their flowery meadow.\nMe alone she wanted to hear them: you are to tie me fast\nwith harsh bonds, keep me upright in place against the mast,\nin its step, with rope ends lashed to the mast itself.\nBut if I beg and command my comrades to release me,\nyou are then to bind me more firmly with yet more bonds.’\n“Thus I was passing on all the details to my comrades,\nand meanwhile our well-built ship very soon arrived\nat the Sirens’ isle, driven on by a following breeze.\nAbruptly the wind now dropped, and was replaced\nby a windless calm. Some god lulled the waves to sleep.\nMy comrades stood up, took down and furled the sail,\nstowed it down in the hollow ship, then sat at the benches\nand whitened the water with their polished pinewood oars.\nNow with the sharp bronze I cut a great wheel of wax\ninto small bits, which I kneaded in my strong hands.\nSoon the wax grew warm under their great pressure\nand the rays of the sun god, Hyperion Helios.\nWith this wax I stopped up the ears of all my comrades,\nand they bound me hand and foot, while standing, to the mast,\nin its step, with rope ends lashed to the mast itself,\nand then sat down, struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\n“But when we were as far off as a man’s shout carries,\nswiftly pursuing our course, the speeding ship did not,\nas it neared, escape notice. The Sirens began their shrill song:\n‘Look in here on your way, famed Odysseus, the Achaians’ pride:\nput in with your ship, hear the song we two sing! Never yet\nhas any man rowed on past us in his black ship till he’s heard\nthe honey-sweet music that issues from our mouths,\nand he voyages on rejoicing, his knowledge increased, for we\nknow all the toil and suffering that in the wide land of Troy\nArgives and Trojans endured through the will of the gods:\nIndeed, we know all things that happen on the nurturing earth.’\n“Such the words they uttered in their beautiful voices. My heart\nyearned to listen. I signaled my comrades to release me—\na nod with my eyebrows. They bent to their oars, rowed on.\nEurylochos and Perimedes both at once stood up,\nbound me with further lashings, made them all tighter.\nBut when they’d rowed past the Sirens, and no longer\nwere their voices or their singing within earshot, then\nmy loyal comrades at once removed the wax with which\nI’d blocked their ears, and released me from my bonds.\n“But after we’d left that island, then very soon I saw\nsmoke, and a heavy surf, and heard a thunderous noise.\nThe rowers were frightened, the oars slipped from their grasp\nand hung clattering in the riptide; the ship came to a halt\nnow they were no longer plying their shapely oar blades.\nBut I went through the ship encouraging my comrades\nwith kindly words, approaching each man in turn: ‘My friends,\nwe’ve not hitherto gone short on experience of trouble!\nThis danger we face now is no greater than when the Kyklops\nby brute force and strength shut us up in his hollow cave—\neven then, my courage, invention, and presence of mind\nfreed us: this peril too, I think, we’ll live to recall!\nSo now, please all do exactly as I command: you must\nstay seated there at the rowlocks and with your oars\nstrike the deep surf of the sea, so that maybe Zeus\nwill grant that we escape, steer clear of this evil fate.\nAnd to you, steersman, I give this command: store it well\nin your memory—you control the hollow ship’s helm!\nKeep the ship well away from all this smoke and surf:\nstay close to the headland, don’t let her veer unnoticed\nacross to the other side, or you’ll destroy us all.’\n“So I spoke, and they promptly obeyed the commands I gave them.\nBut not yet did I mention Skylle, that irremovable danger,\nfor fear lest my comrades, terrified, might abandon\ntheir rowing, and cower together down in the hold.\nIt was now I forgot Kirke’s troublesome instruction\nthat for no purpose whatsoever should I now arm myself.\nI put on my battle gear, I picked out two long spears,\nand carrying them made my way to the vessel’s foredeck,\nfrom where, I figured, this rock-based Skylle would first\nbe glimpsed as she brought disaster to my comrades.\nBut nowhere could I discern her, and my eyes grew weary\nfrom searching every part of the murky rock face.\n“So on through the narrow strait, lamenting, we sailed—and there\non one side was Skylle, on the other bright Charybdis\nfearsomely sucking in the salt seawater: when she\nspewed it back out, like a cauldron over a blazing fire,\nshe was all seething turbulence, and the flying spray\nwas flung up so high that it rained down on the tops\nof both headlands; when she sucked the salt seawater back,\nshe exposed her wild inner turmoil, while all around\nthe rock roared: beneath it the bottom was revealed,\nblack with sand. Pale fear now possessed my men,\nwe gazed at Charybdis in terror, fearing destruction.\nSkylle meanwhile snatched up from the hollow ship\nsix of my comrades, the strongest and most active.\nThough my eyes were on the swift ship and my company,\nI still caught a glimpse of their hands and feet above me\nas they were whirled aloft. They cried out aloud,\ncalled me by name one last time in their anguish. As when\na fisherman with his long rod on a jutting rock\nthrows down bits of bait as a lure when fish are scarce,\nand lets down into the deep the horn of a country ox,\nthen grabs the hooked gasping victim, flings it ashore—\nso they were carried up, gasping, toward the rocks.\nThere at her entrance she devoured them, as they screamed\nand stretched out hands to me in their dire death struggle.\nThat was the most piteous sight of all that ever I endured\nthroughout my whole exploration of the paths of the deep.\n“Then when we’d escaped the rocks and fearsome Charybdis\nand Skylle, soon after that we arrived at the god’s\nmatchless island, where were the splendid broad-browed cattle\nand numerous well-fed flocks of Hyperion Helios.\nWhile still out at sea in my black ship, I could hear\nthe lowing of cattle on the way back to their farmstead\nand the bleating of sheep; and into my mind now stole\nthe words of the blind seer, of Theban Teiresias,\nand of Aiaian Kirke, who most strongly advised me\nto avoid the island of Helios, bright delight of mortals;\nand then, grieved at heart, I spoke out among my comrades:\n‘Distressed though you are, my comrades, mark my words well\nwhile I tell you of the prophetic warning Teiresias uttered,\nhe and Aiaian Kirke: they most strongly advised me\nto avoid the island of Helios, bright delight of mortals,\nfor there, she told me, was our most dreadful danger.\nSo, row our black ship straight on past this island.’\n“So I spoke,\nand the spirit within them was broken. But at once\nEurylochos responded to me in chilling language:\n‘You’re a hard man, Odysseus, with rare strength: your limbs\nnever tire, every last bit of you is fashioned of iron:\nyou won’t let your comrades, worn out by sleeplessness\nand toil, disembark, when we might indeed once more\non this sea-girt isle find the stuff for a tasty supper! But no,\nyou’re making us wander on through the speeding night,\nsteering away from this island over the murky deep!\nIt’s night that breeds dangerous winds, the wreckers of ships—\nhow indeed could we escape from utter destruction\nshould some sudden tearing gale bear down upon us\nfrom the south or the storm-ridden west wind, which most often\nbreak up ships in despite of the gods, their sovereign lords?\nNo, let us now rather yield to black night, put in,\nstay close by the black ship to prepare our supper, and then\nin the morning embark, sail out over the broad sea.’\n“So Eurylochos spoke: the rest of my comrades applauded.\nI saw now what kind of trouble some god had in store for us,\nand so I spoke and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n‘Eurylochos, you force my hand: I’m one man only. But listen:\nI want all of you here present to swear me a mighty oath,\nthat if we come on a herd of cattle, or a great flock\nof sheep, no man will succumb to maleficent recklessness\nand slaughter either a steer or a sheep. Rather show restraint\nand eat the food that immortal Kirke provided for us.’\n“So I spoke. They at once swore not to, as I requested,\nand when they had sworn and completed the oath, then we\nmoored our well-built ship inside the hollow harbor\nnear a freshwater spring, and my comrades disembarked\nfrom the ship and expertly then set about preparing supper.\nBut when they’d put from them the desire for food and drink,\nthen they began to weep, recalling their dear shipmates\nwhom Skylle had snatched from the hollow ship and devoured,\nand sweet sleep came upon them while they were weeping.\nBut in the night’s third watch, when the stars were setting,\nZeus the cloud-gatherer raised a blustering wind against us\nwith a tremendous tempest, sent storm clouds that hid\nboth land and sea: from heaven there sprang forth night.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nwe dragged our ship to a roomy cave and made her fast there,\nwhere the nymphs had their fine dance floors, held their meetings.\nThen I called an assembly and addressed my comrades, saying:\n‘Friends, in our swift ship there is both food and drink:\nso let’s keep our hands off the cattle, lest we come to harm,\nfor these cows and well-fed sheep belong to a dread god,\nHelios, who both sees and hears everything.\n“So I spoke:\nand their proud hearts were persuaded. But after that\nfor an entire month nonstop the south wind blew,\nand no other wind arose, apart from the east and south.\nNow so long as the men still were getting food and red wine\nthey kept their hands off the cattle, being anxious to stay alive;\nbut when the provisions in the ship were all exhausted,\nand they were driven by need to go in search of game—\nfish or fowl, whatever might come to hand,\nangling with bent hooks, for hunger wore down their bellies—\nthen I went off up the island, to pray to the gods:\none of them possibly might show me the road to take.\nSo when going through the island I’d left my comrades,\nI found shelter from the wind and washed my hands,\nand prayed to all the gods that possess Olympos. But what\nthey did was to shed sweet sleep upon my eyelids,\nwhile Eurylochos was giving bad advice to my comrades:\n‘Distressed though you are, my comrades, mark my words well:\nAll kinds of death are loathsome to wretched mortals,\nbut to die of starvation—that’s the most pitiful of fates!\nCome, let’s rather drive off the best of Helios’ cattle,\nand sacrifice to the immortals who hold wide heaven!\nAnd if ever we get to Ithake, our native country,\nwe’ll at once build a lavish temple to Hyperion Helios,\nand fill it with plenty of high-class dedications!\nAnd if he’s angry with us because of his straight-horned cattle,\nand wants to destroy our ship, and the other gods agree,\nI’d rather gulp down seawater and get it over\nthan starve to death slowly here on this desolate island.’\n“So Eurylochos spoke, and my other comrades assented.\nAt once they drove off the best cattle of Helios,\nfrom nearby, since it wasn’t far from our dark-prowed vessel\nthat his fine cows, broad of brow and crumple-horned,\nwere grazing. Around these they stood and prayed to the gods,\nwith the fresh leaves they’d plucked from a tall oak’s foliage,\nsince they had no white barley aboard the well-benched ship.\nWhen they’d prayed and slit the cows’ throats and flayed them,\nthey cut out the thighs, wrapped them up in a double layer\nof fat, and placed above them cuts of raw meat. They had\nno wine left that they could pour over the blazing sacrifice,\nso they made libations with water, roasted the innards.\nBut when the thighs had been burnt and they’d tasted the entrails,\nthen they chopped up the rest and threaded it on spits.\nIt was now that sweet sleep retreated from my eyelids,\nand I set off back to our swift ship and the seashore.\nBut when, as I went, I came close to our shapely vessel,\nthe sweet aroma of roast meat filled the air around me,\nand I groaned and cried out aloud to the immortal gods:\n‘Zeus, Father, and you other blessed gods that are forever,\nit was indeed to my ruin that you lulled me with pitiless sleep\nwhile the comrades I’d left behind committed this monstrous act!’\n“At once to Hyperion Helios long-robed Lampetie\ncame with the news that we had slaughtered his cattle.\nAngered at heart, he at once spoke up among the immortals:\n‘Zeus, Father, and you other blessed gods that are forever,\ntake revenge on the crew of Odysseus, Laertes’ son,\nwho have wantonly slaughtered the cattle in which I took\nsuch pleasure each time I ascended the starry heaven\nand when I turned back down again from heaven to earth.\nIf they don’t compensate me fittingly for my cattle,\nI shall go down to Hades and spread light among the dead.’\n“Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer responded to him, saying:\n‘Helios, please go on shining among the immortals\nand on mortal mankind upon the grain-giving earth!\nThese men’s swift ship I’ll soon hit with a bright thunderbolt\nin the midst of the wine-dark deep and shatter to fragments.’\n“This exchange I learned about later from fair-haired Kalypso,\nwho said she herself had heard it from Hermes the Guide.\n“But when I came back down to the ship and the sea,\nI rebuked all my men, confronting each one of them in turn;\nbut we found no solution. The cows were already dead.\nNow too for my men the gods made a show of portents:\nthe hides crawled, the meat, both raw and roasted, mooed\non the spits, there was a sound like that of lowing cattle.\n“For six days now my oh-so-trusty comrades dined\non Helios’ best cattle that they’d driven off; but when\nZeus son of Kronos brought the seventh day upon us,\nthen the wind stopped blowing at gale force, and we promptly\nboarded our ship and set forth into the wide sea, after\nfirst stepping the mast and hoisting the white sail on it.\nBut once we’d left the island behind, and there was no other\nland above our horizon, nothing but sky and sea,\nthen the son of Kronos conjured up a black cloud\nover our hollow ship, and the deep beneath it darkened.\nShe ran on for no long time, since suddenly there came\na screaming west wind, a tempest blowing at full gale force.\nThe blast of that wind snapped the forestays holding the mast,\nboth of them—back fell the mast, and all its tackle\ndropped pell-mell into the bilge; at the stern of the vessel\nthe mast struck the steersman’s head, crushing all\nthe bones of his skull together. He like a diver fell\nfrom the deck, and clear of the bones his proud spirit fled.\nZeus with a clap of thunder hurled his bolt at our vessel:\nshe shuddered her whole length, struck by the bolt of Zeus,\nand was filled with the reek of sulfur. The crew all fell overboard,\nand like shearwaters went bobbing around our black ship\nborne up by the waves. The god deprived them of their return.\nBut I kept my foothold aboard until the surge tore sides\nfrom keel. The stripped keel the waves now bore off, broke\nthe mast loose at keel level. Attached to the mast\nwas a backstay fashioned of oxhide. This I seized,\nand lashed the two together, the keel and the mast.\nRiding on these, I let the fierce winds sweep me away.\n“But then the tempestuous gale-force west wind ceased,\nand at once instead came the south wind, cause for alarm,\nsince it would carry me back to murderous Charybdis.\nAll night long it so bore me, until at sunrise I came\nto the headland of Skylle and to dread Charybdis, who now\nsucked in the salt seawater; but I reached up\nas high as I could, caught hold of the tall fig tree,\nand clung to it like a bat. Yet I could in no way manage\nto get firm foothold or to climb up on it, since\nits roots were far distant, its branches high, out of reach,\nlong, massive, overshadowing Charybdis. So there\nI clung on persistently, waiting for her to spew back\nthe mast and keel again. To my delight, back they came,\nthough late—at the hour a man leaves assembly for supper,\none who judges the many disputes of quarrelsome young men,\nthen it was that those timbers resurfaced out of Charybdis.\nI let go my handhold and foothold, went plunging down,\nhit the water ahead of the lengthy spars, and sitting\nastride them steered my way onward with both hands.\nBut Skylle the Father of gods and men did not permit\nto see me again, or I’d not have avoided sheer destruction.\n“Nine days I was carried from there, and on the tenth night\nI was brought by the gods to the isle of Ogygia, where\nfair-haired Kalypso dwells, dread goddess of human speech,\nwho befriended and cared for me. But why tell you this story?\nI’ve told it already, just yesterday, here in your house\nto you and your comely wife. I really dislike repeating\na tale that’s been clearly narrated on a previous occasion.”\n",

         "\nSo he spoke: every one of them sat hushed and silent,\nenthralled by his words, throughout the shadowy hall.\nThen Alkinoos once again responded to him, saying:\n“Odysseus, now you’ve come to my brazen-floored home\nwith its high roof, I don’t think you’ll be driven back here again\non your homeward journey, despite all your misadventures!\nThis I say along with a charge on each man here present—\nall you who in my halls daily drink up the elders’\ntawny-red wine, and sit on here, listening to the singer.\nClothes are laid by for the stranger in a polished chest,\nand finely wrought gold, together with all those other gifts\nthat the counselors of the Phaiakians brought here. But come,\nlet’s each one of us now present him with a great tripod\nand cauldron: we’ll recoup the cost by a public collection—\nit’s hard for one man to spend that much without repayment.”\nSo spoke Alkinoos: what he said was pleasing to them.\nThey now retired to rest, each man to his own house.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthey went down to the ship with the bronze in which men delight.\nAlkinoos, princely in power, himself ranged through the ship,\nstowing gifts under the benches, to ensure they would not\nget in the way of the rowers when they bent to their oars.\nThen they went to Alkinoos’ house and had their dinner.\nAlkinoos, princely in power, sacrificed an ox for them\nto Zeus of the dark clouds, son of Kronos, lord over all.\nAfter burning the thighs, they sat down to the splendid feast\nwith great enjoyment. Among them a divine bard performed—\nDemodokos, highly honored by the people. But Odysseus\nkept turning his head toward the bright-shining sun,\nimpatient for it to start setting: he wanted to be gone.\nAs a man longs for supper, one with whose jointed plow\ntwo wine-dark oxen have all day furrowed the field,\nand gladly for him does the light of the sun go down\nthat lets him, weary-kneed, head home for supper—\nso welcome to Odysseus was the arrival of sunset.\nThen at once he addressed the Phaiakians, lovers of the oar,\nto Alkinoos above all declaring his mind, in these words:\n“Alkinoos, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\npour libations, give me safe escort—and farewell to you all!\nEach thing that my heart desired has already been arranged:\nconveyance, and gifts of friendship—may the heavenly deities\nmake these turn out well for me! When I get home\nmay I find my wife truly faithful, my friends all safe and sound!\nAnd may you who remain here give delight to your wedded\nwives and children, may the gods grant you excellence\nof every sort, may no ills ever come among your people.”\nSo he spoke. They all approved, and endorsed the order\nto give the stranger conveyance, since he’d spoken becomingly.\nThen mighty Alkinoos made a request to his herald, saying:\n“Pontonoos, mix us a bowl of wine and serve it to all\nin the hall here, so we may pray to Zeus, the Father,\nand then give this stranger conveyance to his own country.”\nSo he spoke. Pontonoos mixed the mind-honeying wine\nand served it to all in turn. They poured libations,\nfrom where they sat, to the blessed gods who hold\nbroad heaven. Then noble Odysseus stood up,\nand placed the two-handled cup in Arete’s hands,\nand addressed her with winged words, saying: “O queen,\nmay you fare well, now and forever, until old age\nand death, all mortals’ common lot, come on you!\nI’m on my way now, and I wish you all joy in this house\nof your children and people, and of Alkinoos the king.”\nSo spoke noble Odysseus, and stepped out across\nthe threshold, and mighty Alkinoos sent the herald with him\nas his escort, down to the swift ship and the sea,\nwhile Arete sent serving women to accompany him,\none bearing a fresh-washed mantle and tunic, another\nwith orders to carry the close-packed chest, while a third\nbrought the food and the red wine. When they arrived\ndown by the ship and the sea, then quickly the noble\nescorts took over these things and stowed them away\nin the hold of the vessel, all the food and drink.\nFor Odysseus they laid out a linen sheet and a blanket\non the hollow ship’s deck astern to let him sleep soundly.\nHe now went aboard himself and lay down, not speaking.\nThe crew, each in his place, seated themselves at the rowlocks,\nand cast off the hawser from the hole in the stone post.\nThey bent to their task then, flung up the brine with their oar blades,\nand sweet sleep dropped on Odysseus, shuttered his eyelids,\nsweet, deep, and sound, most closely akin to death.\nThe ship—like four yoked stallions on the plain\nthat all spring forward together under the whip’s strokes,\nand swiftly, high-stepping, gallop upon their way—\nlikewise lifted her stern: in her wake there surged a wave,\nvast, dark-hued, of the roaring, many-voiced sea.\nSafe and steady she ran—not even a falcon, the hawk\nthat’s swiftest of all winged creatures, could fly faster,\nso quickly she sheared her way through the waves of the sea,\nbearing a man whose foresight matched that of the gods,\nwho in the past had suffered many sorrows at heart\nboth in men’s wars and while braving the cruel sea,\nbut now slept undisturbed, his sufferings all forgotten.\nAt the time of that brightest star’s rising, which most clearly\ncomes to herald the light of Dawn, early risen, then it was\nthat the seafaring vessel approached the island. There is\na certain harbor of Phorkys, that Old Man of the Sea,\nin the land of Ithake, with two protruding headlands,\neach broken off short, and each crouched facing the harbor,\nwhich they shield from those heavy waves whipped up outside\nby powerful gales, while the well-benched ships lie within\nunmoored, once they reach their position for anchorage.\nAt the head of the harbor there grows a long-leafed olive tree,\nand close to this is a cave, very pleasant and well-shaded,\nthe sacred terrain of those nymphs who are known as Naiads.\nInside it are mixing bowls and two-handled stone jars,\nand there too is where the bees deposit their honey.\nIn the cave there are long stone looms, at which the nymphs\nweave their webs of sea-purple, a wonder to behold.\nSprings, ever-flowing, are there, and the cave has two entrances,\none facing the north wind, accessible to mortals,\nbut the other, looking southward, is sacred, and men\ndo not use it: it is a pathway for the immortals only.\nHere they put in—they knew the place well—and the ship\nran half her whole length up the beach, so great was the speed\nat which she was driven on by the arms of the rowers.\nThen, stepping ashore from the well-benched ship, they first\nlifted Odysseus out of the hollow ship, together\nwith the linen sheet and bright blanket, laid him down,\njust as he was, on the sand, still fast asleep, and unloaded\nthe goods that the noble Phaiakians had given him, through\ngreat-hearted Athene’s prompting, as he set out homeward.\nThese things they left all together by the trunk of the olive tree,\naway from the path, for fear some other traveler might\ncome upon them and filch them before Odysseus woke up.\nThen they took off back home. However, the Earth-Shaker\ndid not forget the threats he’d made earlier against\ngodlike Odysseus, and now he questioned Zeus’ purpose:\n“Zeus, Father, no longer among the immortal gods\nshall I be honored, when some mortals respect me not at all—\nthe Phaiakians, even though they share my own ancestry!\nFor lately I said that Odysseus would have a heap of trouble\nbefore he got home—though I did not wholly deprive him\nof his return: you’d promised that, sworn with your nod!\nYet those men bore him sleeping in their swift ship over the deep,\nset him down on Ithake, gave him countless gifts—\nbronze, and plentiful gold, and woven garments,\nmore than Odysseus could ever have won from Troy\nhad he come home unscathed, with his fair share of the spoils.”\nThen Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, responded to him, saying:\n“Well, wide-powered Earth-Shaker, what a speech that was!\nThe gods do you no dishonor! A harsh business it would be\nto assail with demeaning slights our oldest and noblest!\nBut if any mortal, misled by his own forceful power, fails\nto honor you, you can always be revenged on him hereafter.\nDo as you wish, whatever gives your heart pleasure.”\nThen Poseidon, Earth-Shaker, responded to him, saying:\n“I’d act at once, dark-clouded one, in the way you describe,\nbut I always dread your wrath, and avoid it. Still, now I’d like,\nas that so-beautiful vessel of the Phaiakians comes\nback from its voyage as escort on the misty deep,\nto smash it, make them desist, give up this conveyancing\nof people! And hide their city with a great encircling mountain.\nThen Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, responded to him, saying:\n“My brother, this, to my mind, seems your best way to act:\nWhen all the folk from the city are watching that ship\nas she puts in, then turn her to stone, very close to land,\na stone like the swift ship, so that all mankind may marvel.\nBut don’t hide their city with a great encircling mountain.”\nNow when he heard this, Poseidon, the Earth-Shaker,\nwent off to Scheria, where the Phaiakians dwell,\nand waited there, until that seafaring ship came close\ninshore, moving fast. Then the Earth-Shaker approached.\nHe turned her to stone, and rooted her deep below\nwith one blow from the flat of his hand. Then he was gone.\nThey exchanged winged words then, one to another, did\nthe long-oared Phaiakians, men renowned for their ships,\nand thus would one who’d seen it speak to his neighbor:\n“Ah me, who was it that fettered our swift ship in the sea\non her homeward voyage, when she was in plain sight?”\nSo would one speak. How it happened they had no idea.\nBut Alkinoos made them a speech on the subject, saying:\n“Well now, I do recall certain ancient predictions made\nby my father: he used to say that Poseidon was angry\nwith us, because we give safe convoy to all and sundry.\nOne day, he said, a most beautiful Phaiakian vessel\nreturning from escort duty out on the misty deep\nhe’d strike, and hide our city with a great mountain round it.\nSo said the old man, and now this is being fulfilled!\nSo come, let us all agree to do as I bid: we must cease\nto provide conveyance for mortals, whenever a traveler\nvisits our city; moreover, we must sacrifice to Poseidon\na dozen choice bulls, that he may have compassion for us\nand not hide our city with a great encircling mountain.”\nSo he spoke. They were terrified, got the bulls ready,\nand were all of them busy praying to the lord Poseidon,\nall those leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\nstanding around the altar, when noble Odysseus awoke\nfrom sleep in his native land, yet failed to recognize it,\nso long had he been away; for about him the goddess Pallas\nAthene, Zeus’ daughter, had shed a mist, to make him\nunrecognizable when she told him what was going on,\nand so that neither his wife nor the townsfolk nor his friends\nwould know him until the suitors had paid the full price\nfor their wrongdoing. Thus everything he saw seemed strange\nto their ruler—the unbroken paths, the bays with safe anchorage,\nthe steep rocky cliffs, the flourishing trees. So up he got,\nand stood there, gazing round at his own native land.\nAfter a moment he groaned, and struck both thighs\nwith the flat of his hands, and sorrowfully exclaimed:\n“Alas, to what mortals’ country have I come this time?\nAre they wild and savage, devoid of notions of justice,\nor hospitable to strangers, men with god-fearing minds?\nWhere am I supposed to be taking all this wealth? Where indeed\nam I wandering to myself? I should have stayed put there with\nthe Phaiakians! Then I’d have met some other mighty king\nwho’d have befriended me, helped me with my homecoming!\nNow I’ve no idea where to store this stuff— I can’t leave it here,\nlest it might become, to my cost, the spoil of others.\nNot quite so intelligent or right-thinking, then, I reckon,\nwere those leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians who\ndumped me in some strange country, when indeed they’d said\nthey would bring me to sunny Ithake. They failed to do so.\nMay Zeus, the protector of suppliants, requite them,\nhe who watches over mankind, who punishes each wrongdoer!\nSo I’ll count up the items here, examine them well, and see\nif they took anything with them in their hollow ship when they left.”\nThat said, he set about counting the surpassingly fine tripods\nand cauldrons, the gold, the exquisite woven garments.\nOf these he found nothing missing. But he mourned for his own land\nas he slouched along its shore by the noisy, many-voiced sea,\nwith much lamentation. Athene now approached him,\nin the likeness of a young man, a herder of sheep,\none delicately nurtured, as are the sons of princes:\nround her shoulders she wore, double-folded, a well-made wrap,\non her sleek feet she had sandals, in her hands a hunting spear.\nOdysseus saw her, rejoiced, went up and confronted her,\nand addressed her with winged words, saying: “Good friend,\nsince you’re the first person I’ve encountered in this country,\ngreetings, and may it be with no evil intent you meet me!\nNo, rather rescue these presents, and rescue me, for to you\nI pray now as to a god, I come suppliant to your knees.\nAnd tell me this truthfully, so that I can be certain of it:\nWhat land, what region is this? What people dwell here?\nIs it one of the sunny islands, or some promontory, sloping\ndown to the salty deep from the rich-soiled mainland?”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“You’re an ignoramus, stranger, or you must come from far away\nto be asking about this country. It’s very far from being\nas nameless as all that! Indeed, many people know it,\nboth those who dwell nearer to the dawn and the sun,\nand those further behind, out toward the murky darkness.\nIt’s rough terrain, not fit for the driving of horses,\nYet not wholly worthless, even if lacking broad plains.\nGrain grows there abundantly, wine too is a product,\nthere’s always rain and dew to keep it fertile, it’s good\npasture for goats and cattle, there’s also fine ground cover\nof every sort, together with all-year watering-places.\nThus, stranger, the name of Ithake has spread even to Troy,\nwhich, they say, is far distant from the country of Achaia.”\nSo she spoke. Noble much-enduring Odysseus was glad,\ntaking joy in the land of his fathers as he heard the words\nof Pallas Athene, the daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus;\nand he spoke, addressed her with winged words, yet did not\ntell her the truth, held back his actual story,\nmaking up as he went a plausible tale in his mind:\n“I did hear tell of Ithake, even when in broad Krete,\nfar away over the deep, and now I myself have come here\nbringing these goods of mine. I left as much more with my sons,\nand I’m on the run, after killing a son of Idomeneus—\nswift-footed Orsilochos, who in broad Krete surpassed\nfor fleetness of foot all bread-earning men—because\nhe meant to deprive me of the plunder I’d won from Troy,\n(to get which I’d suffered much agony, battling through\nboth the wars of men and the high seas), because I’d refused\nto do his father a favor by serving as his henchman\nin the land of Troy, while commanding other troops of my own.\nSo I ran him through with my bronze-tipped spear as he came\nback from the fields. I lay in wait for him at the roadside\nwith one companion. A dark night obscured the sky:\nnobody saw us. Unperceived, I robbed him of life.\nBut when I’d dispatched him with the sharp bronze, I went\nat once to the lordly Phoenicians’ ship, besought them—\ngiving them plunder enough to satisfy their desire—\nto take me on board as a passenger, land me at Pylos,\nor noble Elis, where the Epeians hold power.\nBut gale-force winds forced them away from there, though much\nagainst their will: they had no plan to deceive me.\nSo, beaten off course by weather, we arrived here at night,\nand quickly rowed into the harbor, nor did any among us\nthink at all about supper, though we needed it badly,\nbut just as we were, after landing, we all lay down, and sweet\nsleep descended upon me in my exhaustion. But they\nremoved all my goods from the hollow ship, and put them\nclose to where I was lying, there on the sand, and then\nthemselves went aboard and departed for populous Sidon,\nwhile I was left behind here, grieving at heart.”\nSo he spoke.\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, smiled and stroked him\nwith one hand, and changed her appearance into the likeness\nof a tall and beautiful woman, one skilled in fine handiwork,\nand spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Sharp\nand guileful he’d need to be, the man who’d outsmart you\nin every trick, were it even a god who met you! Perverse,\ndevious-minded, obsessed with deceit, won’t you ever,\neven in your own country, abandon your deceptions\nand the lying tales you adore from the very ground up? But let’s\nspeak no more of these things—we’re experts both\nin craftiness: you are the best of all living mortals\nfor counsel and storytelling, while I among all the gods\nam famed for contrivance and sharpness. You failed to recognize\nZeus’ daughter Pallas Athene—I who always stand\nat your side, I who guard you in all your tough endeavors—\nand made sure that you were befriended by all the Phaiakians!\nNow I have come once more to weave a new plan with you,\nto hide all these treasures which the lordly Phaiakians\ngave you for your homecoming—by my plan and urging!—\nand to tell you all the troubles it’s your destiny to endure\nin your well-built home. And endure them you must, not reveal\nto anyone, man or woman, that in fact it’s you,\ncome back from your wanderings, but silently endure\na host of indignities, submit to men’s violent acts.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“It’s hard for a mortal, goddess, to recognize you on meeting,\nhowever clever he is: you can assume any likeness!\nBut this I know well, you were kindly disposed toward me\nback when we sons of Achaians were fighting at Troy.\nBut after we’d sacked the steep citadel of Priam,\nand left in our ships, and some god then scattered the Achaians,\nnever since then, Zeus’ daughter, have I seen you, or observed\nyou boarding my ship, to ward off some trouble from me!\nIt was indeed burdened with a torn heart in my breast\nthat I kept wandering on, until the gods rescued me\nfrom my troubles—until, indeed, in the Phaiakians’ rich land\nyou cheered me with your words, yourself led me to their city!\nNow in your father’s name I entreat you—for I don’t\nthink it’s to sunny Ithake I’ve come, but some other\ncountry I find myself in, and that this assertion of yours\nwas spoken in mockery, to deceive my mind—please tell me\nwhether in fact or not it’s my native land I’ve come to.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“You always have some such idea in your head! That’s why\nI cannot abandon you in your unhappiness. Besides,\nyou’re courteous, sharp-witted, discreet. Any other man\nwould gladly, on getting back after his wanderings,\nhave hurried home to see his wife and children; but you\naren’t willing to ascertain anything or to make enquiries\nuntil you’ve made trial of your wife, who, now as always,\nsits in your halls, while for her the long nights and days\nwaste away slowly in sorrow with the tears she sheds.\nBut this I never doubted, and in my heart knew well—\nthat you’d make it home after losing all your comrades.\nStill, I wasn’t ready to quarrel on your behalf with Poseidon,\nmy father’s brother, who nursed a grudge in his heart\nagainst you, enraged because you blinded his dear son.\nBut come now, I’ll show you the realm of Ithake, convince you!\nThis is the harbor of Phorkys, the Old Man of the Sea,\nand here, at the head of the harbor, is the long-leafed olive tree,\nand close to it the cave, very pleasant and well-shaded,\nthe sacred terrain of those nymphs who are known as Naiads.\nThis is the high-roofed cave where you used to honor\nthose nymphs with so many rich sacrifices; and yonder\nforest-clad mountain is Neriton.”\nThat said, the goddess\ndispersed the mist, and the landscape stood out clearly.\nThen glad indeed was long-suffering noble Odysseus,\nand rejoiced in his country, and kissed the grain-giving earth,\nand at once, raising up his hands, made a prayer to the nymphs:\n“You Naiad nymphs, Zeus’ daughters, never once did I\nthink that I’d see you again! But now with friendly prayers\nI greet you—and gifts I shall give you, as I used to do,\nshould Zeus’ daughter, leader of hosts, be willing to let me\nlive on myself, and to bring my own dear son to manhood.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene responded to him, saying:\n“Be confident, don’t let these matters bother your mind! And now\nlet’s store your goods right away in the furthest recess\nof the sacred cave, where they’ll always be safe for you,\nand ourselves plan how all may turn out for the best.”\nSo saying,\nthe goddess made her way into the shadowy cave,\nsearching through it for hiding places, while Odysseus\nbrought all his treasures inside—the gold, the unworn bronze,\nand the finely made clothing that the Phaiakians gave him.\nThese things he stowed well away, and Pallas Athene,\ndaughter of Zeus of the aegis, set a stone at the entrance.\nThen they both sat down by the trunk of the sacred olive,\nand discussed how to wreak destruction on the arrogant suitors.\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, began the discussion, saying:\n“Scion of Zeus, Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\ntake thought how to lay hands on these shameless suitors\nwho for three years now have been lording it in your halls—\ncourting your godlike wife, pressing wooers’ gifts upon her,\nwhile she, heart yearning sadly for your return, gives hope\nto all, making promises to every last man of them,\nand sending them messages. But her mind is on other things.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“Indeed, I was like to have met the same evil fate\nin my halls as did Agamemnon, son of Atreus,\nhad you not told me, goddess, the whole truth of the matter!\nSo come now, weave me a scheme of revenge upon these men,\nand yourself stand by my side, fill me with strength\nand daring, as when we undid the bright diadem of Troy!\nWere you, grey-eyed goddess, beside me, hot to fight,\nI’d take on, with you, three hundred warriors, O my\nsovereign goddess, given your free and ready support.”\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Assuredly I shall stand by you: you will not go unnoticed\nwhen we are about this business: your broad floor, I think,\nwill be splashed with the blood and brains of more than one\nof those suitors who are now devouring your livelihood!\nFirst, let me make you unrecognizable to any mortal:\nI’ll shrivel the healthy flesh on your supple limbs,\ndestroy the fair hair on your head, wrap you in rags so foul\nas to make the mere sight of a man who’s clad in them disgusting;\nand I’ll dim your eyes, that before were so attractive,\nto make you look really shabby to all these suitors—\nand to your wife, and the son you left behind in your halls.\nNow what you must do first of all is seek out the swineherd—\nhe looks after your pigs, but also is well disposed toward you,\nand loves your son, and discreet Penelope. Him you’ll find\nstationed along with his pigs. These are out at pasture\nclose to the Raven’s Rock and the spring of Arethousa,\nfeeding on plentiful acorns and drinking dark spring water,\nthose things that nourish the abundant fat of swine.\nStay there, and sitting by him, ask all your questions.\nI meanwhile shall go to Sparta, land of fair women,\nand summon Telemachos—your dear son, Odysseus—\nwho went to broad Lakedaimon to visit Menelaos\nand enquire about you, find out if you were still alive.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“Why didn’t you tell him, you whose mind is all-knowing?\nWas it so he too might suffer hardships traversing\nthe unharvested sea, while others devour his livelihood?”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Don’t let him be too heavy a weight upon your mind!\nIt was I who directed him, so he’d get a good reputation\nby going there! He’s suffered no hardship, he’s relaxing\nin the house of Atreus’ son, enjoys his limitless bounty.\nThere are young men lying in wait for him in their black ship,\neager to kill him before he gets back to his native land;\nbut I don’t see it happening. Before that the earth will cover\none or more of the suitors now devouring your livelihood.”\nSo saying, Athene began touching him with her wand.\nShe shriveled the healthy flesh on his supple limbs,\ndestroyed the fair hair on his head, and over his whole\nperson now stretched the skin of an old and age-worn man.\nShe dimmed his eyes, that before were so attractive,\nand changed his clothes to a ragged cloak and tunic,\nall threadbare and filthy, begrimed with foul black smoke;\nand round him she cast the great hide of a speedy deer,\nbald of its hair, and gave him a staff, and a leather bag\ntattered and rent, that was held by a twisted cord.\nPlans made, the two of them parted. The goddess now left\nfor lordly Lakedaimon, in search of Odysseus’ son.\n",

         "\nBut the rough path up from the harbor was that which Odysseus\nnow took, by the woodland and heights, to where Athene\nsaid he’d find the noble swineherd, who, of all the household\nOdysseus possessed, devoted most care to his property.\nEnsconced in his forecourt he found him, where the enclosure\nhad been built up high, at a point with a wide view round,\na fine big open courtyard, in a sheltered position. This\nthe swineherd had built himself, unknown to his mistress\nor old Laertes, for the pigs of his absent master, using\nquarried stones, topped off with a coping of prickly thorn.\nOutside he’d driven in posts, right round in a circle,\nstrong and close, splitting them off from an oak’s dark center;\ninside the enclosure he’d fashioned a dozen sties\nset close to each other, to serve as beds for the pigs:\nin each of them fifty ground-sleeping swine were penned.\nThese were sows, for breeding; the boars bedded down outside,\nand were fewer by far in number, for the godlike suitors\nmade inroads on them for feasting. The swineherd always\nsent them the best of the fattened hogs: there were\nthree hundred and sixty of these, and there slept beside them\nfour guard dogs, as savage as wild beasts, specially reared\nby the swineherd, leader of men. He himself was now busy\nmaking a pair of sandals and fitting them to his feet,\ncutting a piece of fresh-colored oxhide. The others\nhad gone off, one here, one there, with their droves of swine—\nthree of them, that is: the fourth he’d sent into town\nwith a hog, taken under constraint, to the arrogant suitors,\nfor them to slaughter and glut their appetites with the meat.\nOdysseus was suddenly spotted by the ferocious guard dogs,\nand they made for him, barking loudly. Odysseus, however,\nshowing presence of mind, sat down, letting go of his staff.\nYet there on his own farmstead he might have been badly hurt\nhad the swineherd not run up quickly, chasing the dogs\nacross the forecourt, dropping his oxhide as he came,\nand, shouting loudly, had scattered them this way and that\nwith volleys of stones. He then addressed his master, saying:\n“Old man, those dogs came so close to tearing you apart\nin an instant, and you would have put the blame on me!\nAnd the gods have brought on me other griefs and sorrows:\nFor I sit here lamenting, and mourning a godlike master\nand fattening up these hogs for other men to devour,\nwhile he may now be adrift, half-starved and in need of food,\nin some town or country of aliens, foreign of speech—\nthat is, if he’s still alive, and enjoying the sunlight!\nBut come indoors with me now, old man, and after\nyou’ve quietened your heart with food and wine, you too\ncan relate where you’re from, all the hardships you’ve endured.”\nSo saying, the noble swineherd escorted him to his hut,\nushered him in, heaped up thick rough brushwood, and on it\nspread the hide of a shaggy wild goat for him to sit on—\nhis own coverlet, large and hairy—and Odysseus was pleased\nat being given such a good welcome, and addressed him, saying:\n“My host, may Zeus and the other immortal gods now grant you\nwhat you most desire, since you gave me a ready welcome.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, did you make answer, saying:\n“Stranger, were one even meaner than you to come here,\nI’d still have no right to reject him, for all strangers and beggars\nare from Zeus, and a gift, however small, is friendly\nfrom folk such as us; for that’s always the lot of servants,\nfrightened when those who have the mastery over them\nare the young. The gods, it’s true, have blocked that man’s return\nwho’d have treated me as a friend, would have given me possessions—\na home, a plot of land, a much-courted wife, such things\nas a kind-hearted master gives to a servant of his\nwho works hard for him, whose labor a god makes prosper\njust as this work prospers to which I’m now committed.\nFor me my lord would have done much, had he grown old here;\nbut he perished, as I now wish Helen’s whole line had perished,\nutterly, she who unstrung the knees of so many men!\nFor he too went out there to save Agamemnon’s honor,\nto Ilion, rich in good horses, to fight against the Trojans.”\nSo saying, he quickly girded his tunic with a belt,\nand went out to the sties, where the droves of pigs were confined.\nFrom there he chose two, brought them in, and killed them both,\nsinged them and cut them up and put the meat on spits,\nand roasted it. Then he placed the cuts, hot and still spitted,\nwith a sprinkling of white barley, in front of Odysseus.\nIn an ivy-wood bowl he now mixed the honey-sweet wine,\nand sat down facing his guest, and addressed him invitingly:\n“Eat now, stranger! Enjoy the food that’s the fare for servants—\ncheap pork! The fattened hogs are kept for the suitors’ meals,\nmen whose minds care nothing for the gods’ wrath, or for pity.\nThe blessed gods do not favor reckless deeds, but rather\nhave rewards for justice and for men’s righteous deeds.\nEven the hostile and lawless, who invade the land of others\nto get a living, and Zeus allows them their plunder, so that\nthey sail home with laden vessels—on their minds too\nfalls the strong fear of the gods’ wrath. But these men here\nmust know something, must have had some word from a god\nabout his sorry death, since they will not court properly\nor go back to their own possessions, but here at their ease\nwaste our goods wantonly, and restraint there is none,\nfor on every night and day that we get from Zeus they never\nsacrifice just one victim, or even two, I think,\nand our wine they waste, consuming it recklessly.\nGreat indeed, past telling, were his resources: no other\nheroic warrior, either away on the dark mainland,\nor on Ithake itself, could match them. Not twenty men\ntogether had as much wealth: I’ll list you the sum of it.\nOn the mainland, twelve herds of cattle, twelve flocks of sheep,\nas many droves of swine and wide-ranging troops of goats\nare pastured alike by outsiders and his own herdsmen.\nEleven wide-ranging troops of goats browse at the farthest\nend of the island, and over them good men watch,\neach of whom daily drives off one of his troop for them—\nwhichever fattened goat looks to be the best that he has.\nMyself, I guard and watch over these swine here, and choose\nthe best of the hogs to provide for them.”\nSo he spoke.\nHis grateful guest was already downing the meat and wine\ngreedily, in silence, planning trouble for the suitors.\nBut when he’d had supper, and quietened his heart by eating,\nthe swineherd topped up with wine the bowl from which\nhe himself drank, and gave it him; he took it, glad at heart,\nand spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Friend,\nwho was the man that bought you with his resources,\none as wealthy and powerful as you mentioned? You say\nhe perished upholding the honor of Agamemnon: tell me,\nsince such a person I may perhaps recognize;\nfor only Zeus and the other immortal gods may know\nwhether I’ve seen and had news of him: much I’ve wandered.”\nThe swineherd, leader of men, responded to him, saying:\n“Old man, no wanderer who turned up with news of him\nwould ever convince his wife and son: far from it!\nVagrant fellows in need of comfort and sustenance\ntell lies: they have no desire to offer a true account!\nAnyone who in his wandering stops off at Ithake\ngoes straight to my mistress and spins her a lying yarn;\nand she entertains him kindly and questions him in detail,\nwhile shedding tears of sorrow from beneath her eyelids,\nas a woman will do when her husband has perished far away.\nYou too, old man, would be quick to concoct a story\nIf someone gave you for it a cloak and tunic to wear!\nAs for him, by now the dogs and swift birds of prey\nwill have torn the skin from his bones, and the soul’s gone from him,\nor fish in the deep sea have eaten him, and his bones\nare now down under the sands of some mainland beach.\nSo he’s perished out there, and on his friends hereafter—\nall, but on me most of all—grief’s been laid, for never again\nwill I find so kindly a master, however far I go,\nnot even if I went back to my parents’ home, the place\nwhere I was born, and they raised me themselves. Yet it’s not\nso much for them that I grieve—much though I now long\nto set eyes on them again, to be in my own country—\nno, it’s Odysseus for whom I yearn, and he’s gone!\nTo speak his name, stranger, even when he’s absent, I find\npresumptuous, since he always loved and cared for me greatly:\n‘Honored master’ I rather call him, even though he’s far away.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, since yours is a total denial, since you don’t believe\nthat man will ever come back, and your heart’s still incredulous,\nthen I’ll not just make a plain statement, but swear an oath to it\nthat Odysseus will return! I claim the reward for good news\nthe moment that man sets foot inside his home—then clothe me\nin a cloak and a tunic, fine garments! But until then,\nhowever sore my need, I would not accept anything;\nfor as hateful to me as the gates of Hades is the man\nwho, yielding to poverty, concocts a deceitful story.\nZeus, first among gods, be my witness, and this guest’s table,\nand the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\nthat all these things indeed will come to pass as I tell you!\nWithin the current moon’s sequence Odysseus will arrive here,\nbetween this month’s waning and the rising of the next.\nHe will come back home, and take vengeance on all those\nhere who dishonor his wife and his illustrious son.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Neither shall I pay you this reward for good news, old man,\nnor will Odysseus ever come home, so relax and drink,\nand let’s think about other matters—don’t remind me of these!\nThe heart in my breast suffers agonies whenever\nanyone mentions my caring master. As for your oath,\nwe’ll let that ride: may Odysseus indeed come back,\nas I hope and desire, as indeed does Penelope too,\nand aged Laertes, and godlike Telemachos. Now\nit’s for him I ceaselessly grieve, the son Odysseus begot:\nTelemachos. Him the gods bred up like a sapling: I thought\nhe’d grow to be no worse a man among men\nthan his own dear father, a marvel in form and looks.\nBut some immortal damaged the common sense within him,\nor maybe some human: he went after news of his father\nto sacred Pylos, and now the lordly suitors are lying\nin wait for him on his way home, that Arkeisios’ godlike\nline may die out on Ithake, leave no name behind.\nBut we’ll leave him be now, whether he’s to be ambushed\nor escape with a helping hand from the son of Kronos.\nCome now, old sir, inform me about your own misfortunes,\nand make it a truthful account, one that I can rely on!\nWho are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\nWhat kind of ship did you come on? And how did sailors\nbring you here to Ithake? And who did they claim to be?\nFor I don’t imagine you made your way here on foot.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Very well, I’ll give you a truthful account of these matters.\nI only wish that we two had enough supplies of food\nand sweet wine, here in your hut, enough to last a while,\nthat we could feast on in silence, while others did the work:\neasily then could I take up the space of a whole year\nand still not have finished the tale of my heartfelt sufferings—\nsum total of all that by the gods’ will I’ve endured.\n“From broad Krete, I claim, derives my family background:\nI’m the son of a wealthy man, and numerous other\noffspring were born and raised in his halls, legitimate\nsons of his wife; but the mother who bore me was bought,\na concubine. Yet he honored me like his true-born sons,\ndid Kastor, the son of Hylax, from whom I claim descent,\nand who was revered like a god by the Kretans in their land\nfor his wealth and prosperity, his splendid sons. But still\nthe spirits of death pounced on him and carried him off\nto the house of Hades. His property was divided\nby his arrogant sons, who cast lots for it. But to me\nthey allotted a small portion only, house and all.\nYet I married a wife from a wealthy landowning family\non the grounds of my excellence: I was no good-for-nothing,\nno coward in battle. Now all that strength is gone,\nthough I think when you look at the stubble you’ll recognize\nwhat the grain once was. Since then I’ve suffered greatly.\nIn the past Athene and Ares endowed me with courage\nand rank-breaking strength: whenever I chose for an ambush\nour best men, sowing the seeds of trouble for the foe,\nnever did my proud spirit anticipate death: no, I\nwas always the first to spring forward, and with my spear\nto lay low any opponent who lacked my speed of foot.\nSuch a man was I in warfare. Field work was not to my taste,\nnor was running a household—the way to raise fine children.\nOared vessels were always my passion—that, and warfare,\narrows and well-polished javelins—deadly objects,\nto which others, more often than not, react with a shudder;\nbut to me were welcome: maybe a god endeared them to me,\nand different men take pleasure in different actions.\nFor before the Achaians’ sons set foot in the land of Troy\nI had nine times commanded troops and swift-sailing ships\nagainst foreign fighters. Much plunder kept coming my way,\nof which I chose what I fancied, and plenty afterwards\nI obtained by lot. At once my house grew rich: thenceforward\nI became respected and feared among the Kretans.\n“But when\nfar-seeing Zeus devised that hateful expedition\nwhich unstrung the knees of so many warriors, then\nthey ordered me, together with far-famed Idomeneus,\nto lead ships to Ilion, nor was there any device\nthat would let us refuse, for the people’s stern will compelled us.\nThere for nine years we Achaians’ sons were at war,\nbut on the tenth we sacked Priam’s citadel, and set out\nfor home in our ships. A god then scattered the Achaians,\nand for wretched me Zeus the planner thought up more trouble.\nOne month I stayed home, taking pleasure in my children\nand wedded wife and possessions. But after that\nto Egypt my spirit drove me to make a voyage,\nin ships that were well appointed, with my godlike comrades.\nNine ships I fitted out, and their crews assembled quickly.\nFor six days on end my trusty comrades feasted,\nand I provided them with victims in plenty, so they\ncould sacrifice to the gods and have a feast themselves;\nthen on the seventh we boarded, sailed out from broad Krete,\nrunning on before a strong wind out of the north,\nlightly, as though downstream: nor did any misfortune\nbefall my vessels: unscathed and free from sickness\nwe sat there, while the wind and the helmsmen steered them.\n“On the fifth day we reached Egypt’s fine-flowing stream\nand in that Egyptian river I anchored my curved vessels.\nThen I issued orders to my trusty comrades, to remain\nthere with the ships, and to be those ships’ protectors\nwhile I sent off scouts to find and man lookout posts.\nBut, trusting their strength, they yielded to wanton aggression,\nand at once began ravaging the Egyptians’ splendid\nfields, and carrying off their wives and little children,\nand killing the men. Word quickly reached the city,\nand, hearing the shouting, people came out at daybreak.\nThe whole plain filled up with infantry and horses\nand the bright glint of bronze. Zeus, hurler of thunderbolts,\ncast a craven panic upon my comrades: nobody dared\nto stand firm and face the foe, for trouble confronted us\non every side. Many of us they slew with the sharp bronze;\nothers they led off alive, to do forced labor for them.\nBut Zeus himself put this thought in my mind—how I wished\nI had suffered death and encountered my destiny there\nIn Egypt, since yet more sorrow was waiting to welcome me!\nAt once I removed from my head the well-wrought helmet,\nand the shield from my shoulders, and let fall my spear,\nand made my way toward the horses of the king,\nand clasped his knees and kissed them. He rescued and pitied me,\npicked me up in his chariot, took me, weeping, to his home.\nNumerous fighters ran at me with their ash-wood spears,\neager to kill me, for they were greatly angered;\nbut he warded them off, in concern for the wrath of Zeus,\nthe strangers’ protector, the stern requiter of evil deeds.\n“I stayed there for seven years, during which I acquired\ngreat wealth from the men of Egypt, for they all gave me gifts.\nBut when the eighth year came round for me, there appeared\na man, a Phoenician, a fine expert in deceptions,\na sharp nibbler, who already had cheated many people.\nBy his cunning he talked me into accompanying him\nto Phoenicia, where were located his home and his possessions,\nand there I stayed with him till a year had run its course.\nBut when at length the months and days were completed\nOf the circling year, and the seasons in turn came on,\nhe put me aboard a seagoing ship bound for Libya,\nwith a lying tale that we’d both be conveying a cargo,\nbut in fact to sell me there for a high price. I went with him\non the ship, though suspecting trouble, under constraint.\nShe ran on before a strong wind out of the north,\nabove central Krete; but Zeus was planning their destruction,\nand when we’d left Krete behind us, and there was no other\nland in plain view, but nothing save sky and sea,\nthen the son of Kronos conjured up a black cloud\nover our hollow ship, and the deep beneath it darkened.\nZeus with a clap of thunder hurled his bolt at our vessel:\nshe shuddered her whole length, struck by the bolt of Zeus,\nand was filled with the reek of sulfur. The crew all fell overboard,\nand like shearwaters went bobbing around our black ship,\nborne up by the waves. The god deprived them of their return.\nBut for me, in my heartfelt distress, Zeus himself at this moment\nput into my hands the sea-going vessel’s great mast,\nso that once more I might escape destruction. And so,\nclinging firmly to this, I was carried away by fierce winds\nfor nine days, but on the tenth, in the blackness of night,\na great wave rolled me ashore in Thesprotian country.\nThere the Thesprotian king, the hero Pheidon,\ncared for me without payment, for his son now found me\novercome by chill air and exhaustion, and took me home,\nleading me by the hand, till he reached his father’s abode,\nand gave me clothing, a mantle and tunic. It was there\nthat I heard news of Odysseus, for the king now told me\nhe’d befriended and entertained him on his way to his native land,\nand showed me all the possessions Odysseus had amassed—\nbronze and gold, and iron, laboriously wrought,\nenough to support his descendants to the tenth generation,\nso great was the wealth stored for him there in the king’s domain.\nBut Odysseus, he said, had gone to Dodone, to discover,\nfrom the deep-leaved sacred oak, what Zeus was planning,\nand how he should make his way back to Ithake’s rich land\nafter so long an absence, whether openly or in secret.\nAnd he swore to me at home, while pouring libations,\nthat the ship had been launched, and the crew were in readiness\nto convey him to his own country. But me he sent off first,\nsince there chanced to be a Thesprotian vessel ready\nto set sail for Doulichion, that country rich in wheat.\nHe told them to ferry me there, to King Akastos, with proper\ncare; but an evil plan had found favor in their hearts\nabout me, so I’d still suffer at misery’s nadir. When\nthe seagoing vessel had sailed a fair way from land, at once\nthey set about making ready the day of slavery for me.\nMy clothing, my mantle and tunic, they stripped off from me,\nand replaced them with the vile rags and tattered tunic\nthat you can see now in front of you. That same evening\nthey reached the tilled fields of sunny Ithake. Then\nthey left me bound fast in the well-benched ship with a rope\nthat they’d twisted tight, and themselves went off ashore,\nand hastened to take their supper there on the seashore.\nBut the gods themselves took care of me, untied the knots\neasily. Wrapping the rags around my head, I slid down\nthe polished gangplank, plunged breast first into the sea,\nstruck out with both arms, swimming fast, and very quickly\ngot back ashore, well away from where they were.\nThen I went up and found a coppice in full bloom,\nand lay cowering there, while they, complaining loudly,\nwent searching around; but when it seemed quite hopeless\nto go on looking, they went back and reembarked\non their hollow ship. The gods themselves kept me hidden\neasily, then brought me safe here to the farmstead\nof an understanding man. So, it’s still my fate to live.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Ah, wretched stranger, indeed you stirred my heart deeply\nwith your detailed tale of how much you suffered and wandered!\nBut one part was not, I think, right, nor will you convince me—\nwhat you said of Odysseus. Why should a man such as you\ntell a pointless lie? Apropos my lord’s homecoming,\nthis I know well: he got himself so hated by all the gods\nthat they would not allow his life to end among the Trojans\nor in the arms of his friends, after winding up the war.\nThen all the Achaians would have raised him a burial mound,\nand great glory would have been his, and his son’s, hereafter.\nBut now, ingloriously, the storm winds have swept him away.\nI stay out here with the pigs, I don’t go into town,\nexcept those times when prudent Penelope wants me,\nwhen news has reached her from somewhere or other—then\nfolk sit round and keep querying every detail,\nboth those who grieve for their lord who’s been so long gone,\nand those who enjoy eating up his livelihood for free.\nBut I haven’t fancied this business of questioning and enquiries\never since a certain Aitolian deceived me with his story.\nHe was someone who’d killed a man: after wandering far\nhe appeared at my house, and I gave him a friendly welcome.\nHe’d seen him, he said, with the Kretans in Idomeneus’ company,\nrepairing his ships, severely battered by storms. He assured me\nOdysseus would be back here by summer or harvesttime,\nbringing much treasure, both he and his godlike comrades!\nAnd you, grief-struck old man, since some god led you to me,\ndon’t try to please me with lies, or to charm me in any way:\nThat’s not why I shall respect and befriend you, but through fear\nof Zeus, god of strangers, and because I feel pity for you.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“The spirit you have in your breast is indeed distrustful,\none not to be won or persuaded even by my sworn oath!\nCome, then, let’s make an agreement, to which hereafter\nthe gods who hold Olympos can bear witness for us both:\nIf your master does in fact return to this house of his,\nthen give me a mantle and tunic to wear, and send me\non to Doulichion, which is where my heart’s set on going;\nbut if your master does not come back home—as I tell you\nhe will—set your servants on me, have me thrown off a high cliff,\nas a warning to other beggars against telling lying tales.”\nThen the noble swineherd responded to him, saying:\n“Stranger, that way I’d win a fine reputation for virtue\namong men, both today and in time to come, were I,\nwho brought you into my hut and entertained you,\nthen to kill you, deprive you of the dear breath of life!\nVery ready I’d be then to pray to Kronos’ son Zeus!\nBut now it’s time for supper. My comrades should very soon\nbe home, so we can make a tasty meal in the hut.”\nWhile the two thus conversed, the one with the other, the pigs\nand the men who were herding them now drew near. The sows\nthey shut up for the night in their accustomed sties,\nand a vast clamor arose from the pigs as they were penned.\nThen the noble swineherd called to his comrades, saying:\n‘‘Fetch out the best of the hogs, so I can slaughter it\nfor the stranger—he’s traveled far—and we’ll share it too,\nwho have all the trouble of tending these white-tusked swine\nwhile others devour our labor and pay nothing for it.”\nSo saying, he split up wood with the pitiless bronze,\nwhile the others brought in a five-year-old fattened hog\nand set him down by the hearth. Nor did the swineherd\nforget the immortals now, for his was a virtuous mind.\nHe cut off and cast in the fire as firstlings hairs from the head\nof the white-tusked hog, with prayers to all the gods\nthat quick-witted Odysseus might return to his own home.\nThen he lifted a billet of oak he’d kept from the splitting\nand felled the hog. It died. They cut its throat and singed it,\nthen butchered it at once. The swineherd took cuts of raw flesh\nfrom all its limbs as firstlings, wrapped them in rich fat,\ngave them a sprinkling of barley, then threw them in the fire.\nThe rest they cut up, and threaded the pieces on spits,\nand roasted them carefully, then drew all the pieces off\nand heaped them on platters. The swineherd now\nstood up to carve, an expert in fair sharing. The meat\nhe sliced into seven portions: one he set aside\nfor the nymphs and for Hermes, son of Maia, together\nwith an accompanying prayer. Of the rest, each man got one.\nBut Odysseus he honored with the long cuts from the chine\nof the white-tusked hog, and gladdened his master’s heart.\nResourceful Odysseus now addressed him, saying: “Eumaios,\nI only wish you could be as dear to Zeus the Father\nas to me, a poor man, whom you honor with such good things.”\nTo him, then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Eat, my strange guest, and enjoy what’s offered here,\nsuch as it is. A god will give one thing, but let another go,\njust as the whim takes him. He can do anything .”\nSo he spoke, and offered the firstlings to the gods that are forever,\npoured bright wine in libation, then put the cup in the hands\nof Odysseus, sacker of cities, and sat down by his portion.\nBread was served to them by Mesaulios, whom the swineherd\nhad acquired by himself, during his master’s absence,\nunknown to his mistress and to the aged Laertes,\npurchasing him from the Taphians with his own resources.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nMesaulios took off the bread, and they hastened to retire,\nfilled to repletion with all the bread and meat they’d eaten.\nNow night came on—bad weather, the dark of the moon. Zeus rained\nthe whole night through. A strong wet west wind kept blowing.\nThen Odysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd:\nwould he strip off his own cloak and give it him, or tell\none of his comrades to do so, since he cared for him so much?\n‘‘Hear me out now, Eumaios, and you, all his other comrades,\nwhile I tell you a boastful story. It’s the wine that’s urging me—\nmind-crazing stuff, that sets on even the quick-witted\nto singing and gentle laughter, drives him to get up and dance,\nor to make some remark better left unspoken. However,\nnow that I’ve opened up, I won’t keep quiet about it.\nI wish I was young again and my strength still undiminished,\nlike the time we prepared an ambush, and led it beneath Troy’s walls.\nThe leaders were Odysseus and Atreus’ son Menelaos,\nand I was the third in command, at their own invitation.\nWhen we came up under the city and its sheer wall,\naround the outskirts, in the thick brushwood, among\nthe reeds and marshes, crouching down under our arms\nwe lay. A bad night came on when the north wind dropped.\nIt grew chilly. Snow descended on us like hoar frost,\nfreezing cold. Ice crystals formed upon our shields.\nNow all the rest were equipped with cloaks and tunics\nand slept in peace, their shields pulled over their shoulders,\nbut when I set out I’d left my cloak behind with my comrades—\nthoughtlessly, not supposing I’d ever get so cold,\nso I’d come with only my shield and my shining waist-guard.\nBut in the third watch of the night, when the stars had turned,\nthen I spoke to Odysseus, who was lying close beside me,\nnudging him with my elbow. He gave ear at once.\n‘Scion of Zeus, Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\nI shan’t be among the living much longer, this wintry cold\nis killing me, I’ve no cloak, some god beguiled me\ninto wearing a tunic only: there’s no way out for me now.’\n“So I spoke, and he then thought up the following scheme—\nsuch a man he was both for planning and for fighting!—\nand speaking in a low voice he addressed me, saying:\n‘Quiet now, in case some other Achaian might overhear you.’\nWith that, head propped on his bent arm, he made a speech:\n‘Listen, friends: a god-sent dream came to me while I slept.\nWe’ve come too far from the ships. Is there someone who’d go\nand ask Atreus’ son Agamemnon, his people’s shepherd,\ncould he send us more of the troops from beside the ships?’\n“So he spoke, and there stood up Thoas, Andraimon’s son,\nwith alacrity, laid aside his purple cloak, and set off,\nrunning, back to the ships. I lay down in his clothing\ngladly. Then Dawn, golden-throned, appeared. Would that\nI were young now, as then I was, my strength still unimpaired—\nthen would one of the hands in the farmstead lend me a cloak,\nboth from kindness and out of respect for a decent man.\nBut as it is they despise me for the rags I’m wearing.”\nTo him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“Old man, this tale you recounted was faultless: in it\nnothing you said was unfitting or profitless. Hence\nyou’ll not go short of clothing nor of anything else\nthat befits a long-suffering suppliant on arrival—\nfor now: but at first light you’ll go back to your rags,\nsince here there aren’t many cloaks or changes of tunic\nto put on: no more than one for each man. But when\nOdysseus’ dear son returns, you can look to him\nfor clothing to wear, a cloak and a tunic too,\nand he’ll send you wherever your heart and mind desire.”\nSo saying, up he got, and made up close to the fire\na bed, throwing on it the skins of sheep and goats,\nand Odysseus lay down there, and over him he spread\na big thick cloak he kept by him to change into\nwhenever a really bad winter storm arose.\nSo there Odysseus slept, and alongside him slept too\nthe four young men. But the swineherd himself was not\ncontent to bed down there, to sleep away from the hogs,\nand made ready to go outside. Odysseus was glad\nthat he took such care of his absent lord’s property.\nFirst he slung a sharp sword from his sturdy shoulders,\nthen donned a very thick cloak to keep the wind out,\nand over this draped the fleece of a well-fed goat,\nand took a sharp hunting-spear as defense against dogs or men,\nand went out to get some rest where the white-tusked hogs\nslept, under a hollow rock, out of reach of the north wind.\n",

         "\nNow Pallas Athene was gone to spacious Lakedaimon,\nto remind Odysseus’ great-hearted, illustrious son\nabout his return journey, to speed up his homecoming.\nShe found Telemachos and Nestor’s splendid son\nbedded down in the forecourt of glorious Menelaos.\nNow Nestor’s son was still overmastered by gentle sleep,\nbut sweet sleep had not taken Telemachos: worry about his father\nhad kept him wakeful throughout the ambrosial night.\nNow grey-eyed Athene approached and addressed him, saying:\n“It’s not a good thing, Telemachos, this straying far from home,\nneglecting your possessions, the overweening men\ninfesting your house, the risk they may share and consume\nall your goods, while you’re gone on this useless journey!\nYou must urge Menelaos, good at the war cry, at once\nto send you back, if you want to find your blameless mother\nat home still: already her father and brothers are at her\nto marry Eurymachos—as a gift giver he outdoes\nall the other suitors, is ratcheting up the bride-price!\nAnd make sure she takes no item from the house without your consent—\nfor you know the kind of thinking that lurks in a woman’s breast:\nshe wants to increase the estate of the man who marries her,\nbut of former children and previous wedded spouse\nshe takes no thought once he’s dead, no longer asks after him.\nNo, you must go yourself, and entrust all your property\nto whichever one of your maidservants seems most reliable\nuntil the gods name to you your own noble bride-to-be.\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nThe best of the suitors are lying in wait for you, with intent,\nin the strait between Ithake and rugged Same, determined\nto kill you before you get back to your native land.\nBut I don’t see it happening. Before that, the earth will cover\nsome one of the suitors now devouring your livelihood.\nStill, keep your well-built ship far distant from the islands,\nand sail by night: you’ll get a good tailwind from that\none immortal it is who guards and protects you. But when\nyou make landfall at the nearest shore of Ithake then,\nsend on the ship with all your comrades to the city;\nyou yourself, though, must first seek out the swineherd—\nhe looks after your pigs, and also is well disposed\ntoward you. Spend the night there, and tell him to go into town\nwith a message for prudent Penelope: that you’re unharmed,\nand that you’ve made it back home successfully from Pylos.”\nThis said, she went on her way to lofty Olympos.\nTelemachos then awoke Nestor’s son from his sweet sleep\nwith a kick of the foot, saying: “Rise and shine now,\nPeisistratos, Nestor’s son! Bring out your whole-hooved horses,\nharness them up to the chariot! We need to get going.”\nPeisistratos, son of Nestor, responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, however much we want to be on the road\nno way can we drive through the dark night! It’ll soon be dawn.\nSo wait until Menelaos—Atreus’ hero son, famed spearman—\nbrings out his gifts and stows them aboard the chariot,\nand sends us on our way with affectionate good wishes;\nfor a guest remembers with gratitude all his days\nthe man who was his host, who showed him kindness.”\nSo he spoke, and promptly golden-throned Dawn arrived.\nMenelaos, good at the war cry, came out to them then,\ngetting up from the bed that he shared with fair-tressed Helen,\nand when Odysseus’ son, the hero, caught sight of him, he\nhurriedly clothed himself in his shining tunic, and flung\na great cloak over his sturdy shoulders, and went out\nand approached Menelaos and stood before him and said:\n[did Telemachos, the dear son of godlike Odysseus, saying:]\n“Atreus’ son Menelaos, Zeus’ scion, leader of hosts,\nsend me back right away to my own dear country,\nfor already my heart is impatient for the homeward journey.”\nMenelaos, good at the war cry, then responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, I’ll not press you to stay here overlong\nwhen you want to go home: indeed, I’d blame any other man\nwho, as host, behaved in an overfriendly manner\nas I would the downright unfriendly! Moderation in all things\nis best. It’s just as wrong to urge a guest’s departure\nagainst his will as to keep him when he’s itching to be off.\nTreat your guest well while he’s there, let him go when he wants.\nJust wait, though, until I bring your presents, and stow them—\nfine ones—aboard your chariot, for you to see, while I tell\nthe women to get dinner ready from the rich store within.\nFor there’s prestige and glory as well as profit when those\noff to travel this boundless earth eat a square meal first.\nAnd if you’d like a detour through Hellas and mid-Argos,\nI’d be happy to come along with you, I’ll harness up horses\nand be your guide round the cities—no one will pass us on\nempty-handed, they’ll give us something to take with us,\na fine bronze tripod, perhaps, or maybe a cauldron,\nor a team of two mules, or a golden drinking cup.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Atreus’ son Menelaos, Zeus’ scion, leader of hosts,\nI want to go back to our place now: when I came here I left\nno one to act as guardian over my possessions.\nIn seeking my godlike father I fear I may perish myself,\nor some article of great value go missing from my halls.”\nWhen he heard this, at once Menelaos, good at the war cry,\ngave instructions both to his wife and to her handmaids\nto make ready a meal in the hall from the rich store within.\nEteoneus son of Boethoos, now approached him,\nhaving just got up—he lived very close nearby—\nand him Menelaos, good at the war cry, asked\nto light a fire, and to roast some meat: he heard and did not\ndisobey. Menelaos now went to his fragrant storeroom,\nnot alone, but together with Helen and Megapenthes.\nWhen they came to where their valuables were stored\nthe son of Atreus chose a two-handled cup, and told\nhis son Megapenthes to carry a mixing bowl, made of silver,\nwhile Helen went and stood by the clothing-chests, where lay\nthe embroidered robes that she herself had fashioned.\nOne of these Helen, bright among women, chose\nand lifted out—the largest, the most exquisitely embroidered,\nthat shone like a star and lay underneath all the rest.\nThey went on out from the house till they met Telemachos,\nAnd fair-haired Menelaos then addressed him, saying:\n“Telemachos, may the return that your heart so much desires\nbe brought to pass by Zeus, Here’s loud-thundering spouse!\nAnd of all the gifts that are stored away in my house\nI’ll give you the one that’s most beautiful and most precious—\na finely wrought mixing bowl, one fashioned all of silver\nexcept for its rim, that’s finished off in gold,\nthe work of Hephaistos, a gift from the hero Phaidimos,\nthe Sidonians’ king, at the time that his house gave me shelter\non my way home by that route. Now I’d like to give it to you.”\nSo saying, Atreus’ son, the hero, placed in his hands\nthe two-handled cup, and strong Megapenthes brought\nthe shining mixing bowl, all silver, set it before him;\nwhile fair-cheeked Helen came up to him, carrying\nthe robe in her hands, and now addressed him, saying:\n“I too, dear child, now give you this gift, a memento\nfrom Helen’s hands, for your bride to wear at your longed-for\nwedding. Till then, keep it stored in your halls, looked after\nby your dear mother. And may you enjoy a safe return\nto your well-built home and to your own dear country.”\nThat said, she put it into his hands. He received it with pleasure.\nThe hero Peisistratos now took all the gifts and stowed them\nin the luggage box, gazing at them in wondering admiration.\nFair-headed Menelaos now led them into the house\nand had them all sit down upon chairs and benches,\nand a servant brought hand-washing water in a beautiful\ngolden ewer and poured it over a silver basin so\nthey could wash, and drew up a polished table for them.\nThe respected housekeeper brought in bread and served it\nalong with many side dishes, giving freely of what there was,\nwhile, nearby, Boethoos’ son carved helpings of meat,\nand the son of renowned Menelaos poured out the wine.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nThen Telemachos and the splendid son of Nestor\nharnessed the horses and boarded the fine-wrought chariot\nand drove out from the forecourt and the echoing colonnade.\nWith them went Atreus’ son, the fair-haired Menelaos,\nhis right hand holding enough mind-honeying wine\nin a golden cup, so they might, on leaving, pour libations.\nNow he stood in front of the chariot, and pledged them, saying:\n“Farewell, young men—and to Nestor, shepherd of the people,\ntake my greetings: to me he was like a kindly father\nwhen we sons of Achaians were warring in the country of Troy.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“All this indeed, Zeus’ nursling, exactly as you say,\nwe’ll recount to him on arrival. I only wish that as surely,\nwhen I return to Ithake, I’d find Odysseus at home,\nand be able to tell him all the kindness I’d had from you\nbefore coming, all the fine presents that I was bringing home.”\nJust as he finished speaking, a bird flew in on the right,\nan eagle, grasping a great white goose in its talons,\na tame bird out of the yard, and a crowd of men and women\nran behind, shouting. The eagle swooped toward them\nfrom the right, in front of the horses. They rejoiced at the sight,\nand the spirits of all were comforted in their hearts.\nPeisistratos, Nestor’s son, was the first to speak. He said:\n“Consider now, Zeus’ nursling, Menelaos, leader of hosts—\nWas it for us that the god showed this sign, or for you yourself?”\nSo he spoke. Menelaos the warlike was figuring in his mind\nthe right way to think, what might be his best response,\nwhen long-robed Helen got in ahead of him, saying:\n“Listen to me! I shall prophesy now, as the immortals\nput it into my heart, how I think it will come to pass.\nAs this eagle seized the goose brought up in our household,\nswooping down from the mountain where he was born and bred,\nso Odysseus—many ills borne, having wandered far—\nwill come back home and take vengeance, or maybe is home\nalready, and sowing the seeds of trouble for the suitors.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“So now may Zeus enact it, Here’s loud-thundering husband!\nThen there too I’d pray to you as I would to a god.”\nThat said,\nhe gave the horses a touch of the whip: they at once\ngalloped eagerly out of the city toward the plain,\nand strained all day at the yoke set about their necks,\ntill the sun went down and all the ways were in shadow,\nand they came to Pherai, to the dwelling of Diokles\nthe son of Ortilochos, whom Alpheios begot, and there\nthey spent the night, and he entertained them as guests.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthey harnessed the horses and boarded the inlaid chariot,\nand drove out from the forecourt and echoing colonnade.\nAt a touch of the whip the pair, nothing loath, sped forward,\nand soon made their way back to Pylos’ steep citadel.\nThen Telemachos spoke to the son of Nestor, saying:\n“Son of Nestor, will you promise to do the thing I’ll ask you,\nand then in fact do it? We’re friends of long standing ourselves\nbecause of our fathers’ friendship. Besides, we’re the same age,\nso this journey will simply establish our like-mindedness!\nDon’t take me on past my ship, Zeus’ nursling, but leave me there:\nI’m afraid the old man will detain me in his house against my will,\nthrough an urge to befriend me. I need to get home quickly.”\nSo he spoke; and the son of Nestor debated in his heart\nhow he might properly give this promise and fulfill it;\nand as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\nhe turned his horses toward the swift ship and the seashore,\nand there unpacked the fine gifts, laid them out in the ship’s stern—\nthe clothes and gold Menelaos had given Telemachos,\nwhom he now encouraged, addressed with winged words, saying:\n“Embark now, quickly, and summon all your comrades\nbefore I get home and break the news to the old man!\nFor this I know well, in my mind and heart: his spirit\nis so overbearing, he just won’t let you go—\nhe’ll come out here in person to escort you back: I don’t think\nhe’d mean to go home empty-handed! As it is, he’ll be very cross.”\nThat said, he drove off his beautiful-maned horses\nback to the Pylians’ township, and quickly reached his home.\nTelemachos meanwhile urged on his comrades, saying:\n“Put all the gear on the black ship in order, my comrades,\nand let’s embark ourselves, and then be on our way.”\nSo he spoke; they heard and promptly obeyed him,\nand embarked at once, and seated themselves at their rowlocks.\nNow while he was busy with prayer and sacrifice to Athene\nby the stern of the ship, he was approached by a person\nfrom a distant land, Argos—a fugitive murderer,\na seer, a man related by descent to Melampous,\nwho long ago was a dweller in Pylos, mother of flocks—\na wealthy Pylian, occupant of a very large house, but now\na stranger in other men’s country, fleeing from his own land\nand from great-hearted Neleus, noblest of living men,\nwho for a full year had kept his great wealth from him\nby main force, for Melampous lay shackled in Phylakos’ halls,\nunder harsh constraint, and suffering grievous hardship\nbecause of Neleus’ daughter, and the heavy infatuation\nwhich the Fury—that ruinous goddess—put in his mind.\nAnd yet\nhe escaped his fate, and drove off the loud-lowing cattle\nto Pylos from Phylake, paid out the godlike Neleus\nfor his misdeed, and brought the girl home as a wife\nfor his own brother. He himself went to other men’s land,\nto horse-pasturing Argos, where it was destined that he\nshould dwell, and hold sway over numerous Argives. There\nhe married a wife and established a high-roofed house,\nand sired Antiphates and Mantios, two sturdy sons.\nAntiphates later begot great-hearted Oikles, and\nOikles sired Amphiaraos, rouser of hosts, whom Zeus\nof the aegis and Apollo both held in great affection\nand befriended in every way. Yet he never reached old age’s\nthreshold, but died in Thebai because of a woman’s gifts.\nTo him were born two sons, Amphilochos and Alkmaion,\nwhile Mantios begot Polypheides and Kleitos. The latter\nDawn, golden-throned, snatched away because of his beauty,\nso that he might be numbered among the immortals;\nbut high-spirited Polypheides Apollo made a seer,\nby far the best of mortals, after Amphiaraos died.\nHe moved to Hyperesea when he fell out with his father,\nand there he made his home, and prophesied to all mortals.\nHis son it was, Theoklymenos by name, who now\ncame up and stood by Telemachos. He found him pouring\nlibations and praying, there by his black ship,\nand he spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Friend, since I find you at sacrifice in this place,\nI entreat you by these burnt offerings, by the god, and by\nyour own head, and by the comrades who travel with you,\nanswer what I ask truly, and hold back nothing:\nWho are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“So, stranger, let me answer your questions quite honestly:\nI’m from Ithake by birth, and my father is Odysseus—\nif ever he was—who by now must have met his grim destiny—\nwhich is why I’ve set out with my comrades in a black ship\nand have come seeking news of my long-absent father.”\nTheoklymenos the godlike responded to him, saying:\n“I likewise have left my country, after killing a man\nof my own clan: many brothers and kinsmen he has\nin horse-pasturing Argos, with great power over Achaians.\nIt’s to avoid meeting death and black fate at their hands\nthat I’m on the run. It’s my fate to wander among men.\nTake me aboard your ship, as your suppliant fugitive,\nlest they murder me, for I think they’re hot on my trail.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“I shall not, since you want it, debar you from my trim ship.\nCome aboard! We’ll look after you, with what little we have.”\nSo saying, he took the other’s bronze spear from him,\nand laid it at length on the deck of the shapely vessel,\nthen he himself embarked on the seagoing ship,\nand seated himself in the stern, and made a place beside him\nfor Theoklymenos too. His men cast off the stern warps,\nand Telemachos now issued orders to his comrades\nto belay the tackle, and they promptly obeyed him.\nThe fir-wood mast they raised up and stepped in the hollow\nmast block, held it in place with the forestays, and then\nhauled up the white sail with the halyards of plaited leather.\nGrey-eyed Athene now sent them a blustery tailwind,\ngusting through the bright air, so the ship might swiftly\ncomplete her journey, speeding over the briny deep.\n[They voyaged past The Springs, and sweet-streamed Chalkis],\ntill the sun went down and all the ways were in shadow,\nand the ship reached Pheai, driven on by the wind of Zeus,\nthen skirted bright Elis, where the Epeians hold sway.\nOnward from there Telemachos made for the Sharp Islands,\nuncertain in mind if he was going to dodge death or be captured.\nBack in the hut, Odysseus and the noble swineherd\nwere at supper: the other men were eating the meal with them.\nWhen they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nOdysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd,\nto see if he’d still befriend him, invite him to stay there\nin the farmstead, or urge him to try his luck in the city.\n“Hear me out now, Eumaios, and all you other comrades!\nIn the morning I’m minded to make my way to the city,\nto beg for food, and not be a burden on you and your fellows.\nSo advise me well, and give me a reliable guide\nto take me there. But I’ll need to wander through the city\non my own, perhaps be given some bread, a cup of water.\nI might even go to the house of noble Odysseus,\nand impart what news I have to prudent Penelope, mingle\nin the company of the suitors, overbearing though they are,\nto see if they’d spare me dinner from their limitless plenty.\nI could offer them, there and then, services they might need—\nlet me list them, and you pay attention and hear me out!—\nThrough the favor of Hermes the Guide, the god who endows\nthe endeavors of every man with elegance and renown,\nin the matter of service, no other mortal could match me:\nbuilding a fire well, or chopping up dry firewood,\nor carving and roasting meat, or pouring out the wine—\nall such things in which the common folk serve their betters.”\nDeeply disturbed you then answered him, swineherd Eumaios:\n“Oh my, stranger, what can have put such a notion\ninto your mind? You must be set on your own destruction\nif you mean to go in among this company of suitors,\nwhose violence and arrogance go up to the iron sky!\nNot such as you are the servants of these people:\nno indeed: it’s young men, well dressed in mantles and tunics,\ntheir heads always slick with oil, their faces handsome,\nwho wait on them: their tables are kept well polished,\nand are heavily laden with bread and meat and wine.\nNo, you stay here, where no one’s irked by your presence—\nneither I, nor any of the other men I have here.\nBut when the dear son of Odysseus comes back home,\nhe’ll fit you out with a cloak and tunic, and send you\nwherever your heart and spirit say you should go.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Eumaios, I wish you could be as dear to Zeus the Father\nas to me, whom you’ve saved from wandering and distress!\nThere’s no worse evil for mortals than vagrancy; and yet\nfor the sake of their cursed bellies men incur grim hardship\n[when wandering, grief, and pain assail any one of them].\nBut now, since you’re keeping me here, and want me to wait\nfor him, your master, now tell me of godlike Odysseus’ mother\nand father, whom he left here on the edge of old age—\nare they perhaps still living beneath the rays of the sun,\nor are they dead by now and in the realm of Hades?”\nThen the swineherd, leader of men, responded to him:\n“So, stranger, I’ll give your question a truthful answer.\nLaertes still lives, but constantly prays to Zeus\nthat the spirit may fade from his limbs within his halls,\nbecause of his terrible grief for the son who’s absent,\nand for his wise wedded wife, who by dying caused him\nmost sorrow, and brought him to old age before his time.\nShe died of grief, lamenting her glorious son—\na miserable death, that I’d wish no man to suffer\nthat lived here as my close friend and treated me kindly.\nSo long as she lived, though it was in a state of sorrow,\nIt gave me pleasure to ask and enquire after her, since she\nhad raised me herself, together with long-robed Ktimene,\nher clever daughter, whom she bore as her youngest child.\nWith her I was reared, and she favored me scarcely less.\nBut when we both reached the longed-for prime of youth,\nher they saw married on Same, and she had countless bride-gifts;\nbut me she clothed in a mantle and tunic, both\nof the finest stuff, shod me with sandals, and then sent me\nout on the estate. Yet at heart it was me she cared for more.\nThese days I go short of such things, yet the blessed gods\nprosper the work of my hands, at which I labor:\nthat lets me eat and drink, care for respected guests.\nYet from my mistress I hear nothing pleasant, either\nby word or deed, for an evil has fallen on the household—\nthese arrogant men! The servants greatly need and want\nto speak personally with their mistress, check each detail,\neat and drink, and then take some tid-bit back with them\nto the fields—such are the things as warm a servant’s heart.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Indeed, swineherd Eumaios, how little you must have been\nwhen parted so far from your country and your parents!\nBut come now, tell me this, and give me the true answer:\nWas the wide-wayed city of men destroyed in which\nyour father and lady mother had their dwelling?\nOr when you were out alone with your sheep or cattle,\ndid hostile men carry you off in their ships for sale here\nto your master’s house, and he paid a good price for you?”\nThen the swineherd, leader of men, responded to him, saying:\n“Stranger, since you’re questioning me about these matters,\nlisten in silence now at your ease, and drink your wine\nwhile you sit here. These nights are endless: you can sleep,\nyou can also listen for pleasure. No need to bed down\nbefore the time comes. Too much sleep can be exhausting.\nIf any one of the rest of you feels the urge to do so,\nlet him go out and sleep in the open: then, when it’s dawn,\nget a bite to eat, and take care of our master’s swine.\nBut we two will drink and feast in the hut, and enjoy\nhearing about each other’s wretched misfortunes\nas we recall them. A man looking back can find pleasure\neven in grief, one who’s suffered and wandered much.\n“So now let me answer the questions that you asked me.\nThere’s an island called Syria—you may have heard tell of it—\nat the turning points of the sun, out beyond Ortygie,\nIt’s not very populous, but possesses excellent terrain:\ngood for cattle and sheep, many vineyards, abundant wheat.\nNo famine ever afflicts this land, nor does any other\nhateful disease appear as a plague to wretched mortals,\nbut when the tribes of mankind grow old in the city,\nthen comes silver-bowed Apollo, together with Artemis,\nand assails and slays them with his gentle arrows.\nTwo cities there are: all the land’s divided between them,\nand over them both my father held sway as king—\nKtesios, Ormenos’ son, who was likened to the immortals.\n“Thither Phoenicians came, men famous for their ships,\nsharp traffickers, countless trinkets in their black vessel.\nNow there was in my father’s household a Phoenician woman,\ntall and good-looking, highly skilled in fine handiwork,\nand her these crafty Phoenicians set about to beguile.\nFirst, while she was washing clothes near the hollow ship,\none of them made love to her, a thing that fuddles the senses\nof truly feminine women, even one that’s well-behaved.\nThen he asked her who she was and from where, and she at once\npointed out my father’s high-roofed house, and declared:\n‘I come from Sidon, that bronze-rich city, and am\nthe daughter of Arybas, a man who had rivers of wealth;\nbut a bunch of Taphian pirates kidnapped me on my way\nback from the fields, and brought me here. I was sold\nto the man who lives up there, and he paid a good price for me.’\n“Then the man who’d secretly had her responded to her, saying:\n‘Would you like to go back with us now and get to see\nthe high-roofed house of your father and mother?—them too,\nfor they’re still alive, and the word is they’re very rich?’\n“Then the woman responded to him in these words, saying:\n‘This indeed might be done, if all you sailors were willing\nto swear an oath that you’d deliver me home unharmed.’\n“So she spoke, and they all swore the oath as she demanded.\nBut when they’d sworn, and completed the terms of the oath,\nthe woman addressed them again, in these words, saying:\n‘Keep quiet now, and let none of your crew accost me\nif we chance to encounter each other, either out on the street\nor at the well, in case someone goes to his dwelling\nand tells the old man, so that he becomes suspicious\nand keeps me closely confined, and plans your destruction.\nSo don’t forget what I say, and be quick with the barter\nfor your homeward voyage! When your ship is fully laden,\nthen contact me up at the house, and I will come,\nwith any gold I can find; and there’s one other thing\nI’d be glad to give you in return for my passage—a son\nof my master, whose house-nurse I am, a clever child\nwho trots along at my side when I go out: I’d bring him\naboard with me—he’d fetch you a gigantic price, wherever\nyou chose to sell him abroad to some foreign buyer.’\n“So she spoke, and went off back to the splendid mansion.\nThey stayed there in our country for an entire year,\nand by trafficking piled up the goods in their hollow ship.\nBut when the ship’s hold was full-laden for their return,\nthey then sent a messenger to alert the woman.\nA sharp-witted man it was that came to my father’s dwelling,\nbringing a golden necklace interlaced with amber beads.\nSo while in the hall the maidservants and my lady mother\nwere handling and looking at this and making their offer\nto buy it, the man nodded silently to the woman,\nand, having done this, departed, making for the hollow ship,\nand she took me by the hand, led me out of the house.\nThere in the forecourt she found the cups and tables\nof the men who’d been dining, associates of my father\nwho’d left for a council session, with public discussion.\nShe quickly hid three cups under the front fold of her dress\nand carried them off. In my innocence I went with her.\nSo the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow,\nand we hurriedly made our way to the famous harbor\nwhere these Phoenician men’s swift ship was moored.\nThey now embarked, and sailed out over the watery ways,\nwith us two on board as well: Zeus gave us a tailwind.\nFor six days we sailed, both night and day; but when\nZeus, son of Kronos, brought on the seventh day,\nthen Artemis, divine archer, struck the woman down,\nand she fell in the bilge like a sea tern, with a thud.\nHer corpse they threw overboard to end as food for seals\nand fishes, and I was left there, grieving at heart.\nNow wind and wave in their passage carried us to Ithake,\nwhere Laertes bought me with his resources. Thus it was\nthat I first happened to set eyes on this country.”\nTo him then Odysseus, Zeus’ scion, responded, saying:\n“Indeed, Eumaios, you’ve stirred the spirit in my breast\nby telling me all the heartfelt sorrows you endured!\nYet surely you had some good along with the suffering\nfrom Zeus? After all your troubles you ended in the household\nof a decent man, who takes good care to provide you\nwith food and drink, and you have a good life; whereas I\ngot here as a vagrant, who’d strayed through many folks’ cities.”\nThese were the things they talked about to each other.\nNow they lay down and slept—briefly, not long, for soon\ncame fair-throned Dawn. And meanwhile Telemachos’ comrades\nmade landfall. They furled the sail, unstepped the mast,\nsmartly, and rowed the ship on till they reached their anchorage,\nthen belayed the stern warps, threw out the anchor stones,\nand themselves, disembarking on the strand of the seashore,\nprepared their meal, and mixed the bright red wine;\nand when they’d satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nsagacious Telemachos spoke first among them, saying:\n“The rest of you now row the black ship on to the city.\nI’m going out to inspect the fields and the herdsmen,\nand I’ll come into town this evening when I’ve seen to the estate.\nEarly tomorrow I’ll give you, as wages for your journey,\na square meal of meat, with some sweetly drinkable wine.”\nThen godlike Theoklymenos addressed him, saying:\n“Where should I go, dear child? To which particular house\nof the men in authority over rugged Ithake?\nOr shall I go straight to your house—yours and your mother’s?”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“In different circumstances I’d tell you to go to our house,\nwhere there’s no lack of hospitality; but for yourself\nthat’s not a good idea, since I’ll be away, and my mother\nwon’t see you: she seldom comes out in the house to face\nthe suitors, but works at her loom apart from them, upstairs.\nBut I’ll tell you another man to whom you can go instead—\nEurymachos, glorious son of skillful Polybos,\nwhom nowadays the Ithakans treat like a god, for he\nis their best man by far, as well as the most determined\nto marry my mother, acquire Odysseus’ privileges!\nYet Olympian Zeus alone, the sky-dweller, knows whether\nhe’ll meet with his day of ill destiny before that wedding.”\nAs he spoke, a bird flew by on the right: a falcon,\nApollo’s swift messenger, clutching a dove in its talons,\nand plucking its feathers, that were shed on the ground\nmidway between the ship and Telemachos himself.\nThen Theoklymenos called him aside from his comrades,\nand clasping him by the hand, exclaimed: “Telemachos,\nnot without some god’s will did that bird fly on our right!\nI knew, when I saw it, that this had to be an omen!\nThere is no other family that’s more kingly than yours\nin the whole realm of Ithake: you’ll hold power forever.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“If only these words of yours, stranger, might be fulfilled!\nThen would you quickly know friendship and gifts in plenty\nfrom me, so that any who met you would call you blessed.”\nThat said, he then addressed Peiraios, a faithful comrade:\n“Peiraios, son of Klytios, in all else you’re the most\nreliable of the comrades who accompanied me to Pylos:\nso now, please, take this stranger, give him a proper welcome\nin your home, with all due honor, until I come back.”\nPeiraios, famous spearman, responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, no matter how long you may stay out here,\nI shall take care of this man: as a guest he’ll lack for nothing.”\nSo saying, he boarded the ship, and ordered his companions\nto cast off the stern warps and to embark themselves.\nThey at once went on board, and sat down at their rowlocks.\nBut Telemachos shod himself in his well-made sandals,\nand took his sturdy spear, tipped with sharp-pointed bronze,\nfrom the deck of the ship. They cast off the stern warps,\npushed clear, and made for the city, just as Telemachos,\ndear son of godlike Odysseus, had ordered them to do.\nBut him his feet bore on, briskly striding, till he reached\nthe farmstead where were pigs unnumbered, beside which\nslept the good swineherd, with kind thoughts for his masters.\n",

         "\nThe two in the hut, Odysseus and the noble swineherd,\nhad stirred up the fire, and were making breakfast at dawn,\nand had sent out the herdsmen with droves of pigs to pasture.\nTheir usually noisy dogs now fawned round Telemachos,\nnot barking as he approached them. Noble Odysseus noticed\nboth the dogs’ silent fawning and the sound of footsteps,\nand at once he addressed Eumaios with winged words, saying:\n“Eumaios, there’s somebody coming here—one of your comrades,\nor some other acquaintance, because the dogs aren’t barking\nbut making up to him—and I can hear his footsteps.”\nHe’d not yet finished speaking when his own dear son\nappeared in the doorway. Amazed, the swineherd sprang up,\nand the vessels fell from his hands with which he’d been busy\nmixing the bright red wine. He went to greet his master\nand kissed his head and his two bright shining eyes\nand both his hands, tears falling thick and fast.\nAs a loving father welcomes his own dear son’s return\nfrom some distant land, after a ten-year absence—\nhis only son, late-born, for whose sake he’s suffered much—\nso now did the noble swineherd clasp godlike Telemachos\nand kiss him all over, as though he’d escaped from death,\nand, still weeping, then address him with winged words, saying:\n“You’re back, Telemachos, sweet light of my eyes! I thought\nI’d never see you again when you sailed off to Pylos!\nCome in now, dear child, and let me pleasure my heart\nwith the sight of you inside here, now you’ve arrived!\nFor you don’t often make visits to the herdsmen on the estate,\nbut stay in town: these days it would seem your fancy is\nto observe the baneful throng of these men, the suitors.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“So it shall be, old fellow. It’s on your account I’m here,\nto see you myself, and have you tell me whether\nmy mother is still in the house, or by now some other man\nhas got her in marriage, so that maybe Odysseus’ bed,\nfor lack of occupants, is full of foul spiders’ webs.”\nThen the swineherd, leader of men, responded to him, saying:\n“Indeed, she still holds on with an all too steadfast spirit\nhere in your halls, and always the sorrowful nights\nand days too waste her away with ceaseless weeping.”\nAfter thus speaking he took the bronze spear from him,\nand Telemachos entered, passing over the stone threshold.\nAs he approached, Odysseus, his father, offered him his seat,\nBut Telemachos, facing him, refused the offer, saying:\n“Sit down, stranger: we’ll find us another seat somewhere\nin our own farmstead—here’s the man’s who’ll set it for us.”\nSo he spoke. Odysseus sat down again. For Telemachos\nthe swineherd spread green brushwood, put a fleece over it,\nand Odysseus’ dear son now seated himself, and the swineherd\nset before each of them platters of roast meat\nleft over from what they’d eaten the day before,\nand hastily put fresh cuts of bread in the baskets,\nand in his ivy-wood bowl mixed some honey-sweet wine,\nand then sat down himself, facing godlike Odysseus.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them;\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nTelemachos then addressed the noble swineherd, saying:\n“Dad, where did this stranger come from? How did sailors\nbring him here to Ithake? Who did they say they were?\nFor I don’t imagine he made his way here on foot.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Very well, child: I’ll tell you the whole true story. He claims\nto be from broad Krete by birth. He says he’s wandered\nall over, from one human settlement to another,\na vagrant: that’s the fate some divinity spun for him.\nBut now he’s run away from a vessel of the Thesprotians\nand come to my farmstead. I put him into your hands.\nDo what you like with him. He says he’s your suppliant.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Eumaios, what you just said embarrasses me! For how\nam I to give this stranger a good welcome in my house?\nI’m only a youth still, I don’t trust the strength of my hands\nagainst any man who may pick a quarrel with me.\nAs for my mother, the heart in her breast is divided,\nwhether to stay there with me and run the household,\nrespecting her husband’s bed and the voice of the people,\nor to go off with whoever’s the best of the Achaians\nas a suitor there in her halls, who offers the richest gifts.\nAnd regarding this stranger, since he’s come to your home,\nI’ll clothe him in mantle and tunic, garments of quality,\nand give him a two-edged sword and sandals for his feet,\nand send him wherever his heart and spirit dictate.\nOr, if you like, keep him here and care for him in the farmstead,\nand I’ll send him down clothes and all the food he needs\nto eat, so he won’t be the ruin of you and your comrades.\nBut up there I won’t let him go, to sojourn among\nthe suitors, for they’re overweening and wanton, and may\nmock him: that would cause me the greatest embarrassment.\nIt’s hard for one man to get anything done against many,\nhowever strong he may be: they have far the greater power.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus now addressed him, saying:\n“Friend—surely it’s proper that I should reply—indeed\nyou rend my heart as I listen to all you tell me\nof the reckless acts that these suitors are now committing\nin your halls, against the will of one such as yourself!\nTell me, do you let yourself be oppressed? Or is it\nthat some god’s word has led your countrymen to hate you?\nOr is it your brothers you blame, whom a man relies on\nin a tight corner, even when a major feud arises?\nI wish I was really as young now as I am in spirit,\nor the son of peerless Odysseus, or the man himself—\nmight return from his wandering: there’s still room for hope:\nthen might some foreign mortal at once cut off my head\nif I didn’t prove myself a disaster to all those fellows\nwhen I came to the main hall of Laertes’ son Odysseus!\nWere they to overwhelm me, one man alone, by numbers,\nI’d much rather go down fighting, killed in my own home,\nthan have to go on witnessing these unseemly actions—\nstrangers maltreated, women servants forcibly dragged\nand manhandled everywhere in this beautiful building,\nwine recklessly squandered, men devouring my food\nwithout purpose or limit, no end to the business in sight.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“So, stranger, I’ll give you a full and truthful answer.\nThe people in general do not hate or resent me,\nnor have I brothers to blame, whom a man relies on\nin a tight corner, even when a major feud arises.\nThe fact is, our line’s been kept single by the son of Kronos:\nArkeisios sired Laertes, his one and only son;\nThen he in turn had one son, Odysseus; and Odysseus\nhad only me, left me here in his halls, got no joy of me.\nThat’s why countless enemies now occupy our house.\nFor all the highborn leaders who lord it over the islands—\nDoulichion, Same, and forested Zakynthos,\nbesides those who rule as princes in rugged Ithake—\nare all courting my mother, and wasting my property.\nShe neither rejects this hateful marriage nor is able\nto end the business; so they go on eating up my estate\nand waste it away—very soon they’ll tear me to pieces too!\nYet indeed all these matters rest on the knees of the gods.\nBut now, dad, you go quickly, tell strong-minded Penelope\nthat I’m safely back here for her, all the way from Pylos.\nI’m going to stay on here, and you come straight back yourself\nwhen you’ve told her, and only her: not a single other Achaian\nshould get wind of it. Many people are planning trouble for me.”\nTo him, then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\nBut come, tell me this, and give me an honest answer:\nShould I not, this same trip, also take the news to Laertes,\npoor man? For a while, despite his great grief over Odysseus,\nhe’d still keep an eye on the fields, still eat and drink\nwith the servants at home whenever the mood so took him;\nbut now, from the day when you went off by ship to Pylos,\nthey say he no longer eats or drinks as before,\nor goes out to the estate, but sits wailing and weeping\nin lamentation, and the flesh is wasting from his bones.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“That’s too sad, but for now we’ll leave him, despite our grief.\nFor if mortals somehow could have all they wanted, then\nour first choice would be the day for my father’s return.\nWhen you’ve given your message, come back. Don’t wander off\nover the fields after him, but instruct my mother\nto send off a servant, the housekeeper, as soon as may be,\nsecretly: she could take a message to the old man.”\nWith that he sent off the swineherd, who found his sandals,\nput them on, and left for the city. Nor did Athene fail\nto see the swineherd Eumaios depart from the farmstead,\nand herself approached now, in the likeness of a woman,\none tall and handsome, and skilled in fine handiwork.\nShe stood outside the hut’s entrance, visible to Odysseus;\nbut Telemachos neither saw her in front of him nor\nwas aware of her presence: gods are not clearly manifest to all.\nBut the dogs, like Odysseus, saw her: they didn’t bark, but slunk—\nterrified, whining—to the far side of the farmstead.\nShe nodded to noble Odysseus: he saw it, and went\nout from the hall, past the great wall of the courtyard,\nand stood before her. Athene then addressed him, saying:\n“Laertes’ son, Zeus’ scion, resourceful Odysseus,\nthe time has come: say the word to your son, don’t hide it,\nso that you both may plot death and doom for the suitors\nfor when you go back to the far-famed city: I myself\nshall not be slow to join you: I’m ready for this battle!”\nThat said, Athene touched him with her golden wand.\nShe dressed him first in a new well-laundered mantle\nand tunic, made his body more youthful and powerful.\nHis complexion grew swarthy again, his cheeks filled out,\nand the beard on his chin darkened once more. This done,\nshe took herself off, and Odysseus now went back\ninto the hut. His dear son was amazed at the sight,\nand averted his eyes in alarm, lest this might be a god,\nand spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Stranger, you look quite different from what you did earlier:\nyou have different clothes on, your color isn’t the same!\nYou must be one of the gods who hold broad heaven!\nBe gracious, that we may bring you acceptable offerings\nand golden gifts, finely wrought. Only spare us, be merciful!”\nTo him then much-enduring noble Odysseus responded:\n“I am no kind of god! Why liken me to the immortals?\nNo, I am your father, for whose sake you are grieving\nand suffering much from the violence of men.”\nSo saying\nhe kissed his son, and the tears ran down his cheeks\nthat hitherto he’d always firmly held back; but Telemachos—\nnot yet convinced that this man was really his father—\nonce more spoke out, and responded to him, saying\n“You can’t be Odysseus, my father! No, this is some deity\nthat’s deceiving me, so that I’ll grieve more bitterly hereafter!\nThere’s no way a mortal man could contrive all this\nby his own unaided wit—it required a god to help him,\nwho could easily as he wanted make him either young or old.\nFor you, a moment ago, were an old man, meanly clad,\nwhereas now you resemble the gods who possess broad heaven.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, it’s not fitting, when your own father is here,\nin the house, to be so astonished, indeed suspicious!\nI tell you, no other Odysseus will ever come here—\nIt is I, such as I am, who have suffered much, wandered far,\nand now, in the twentieth year, have come back home!\nWhat you see here’s the work of Athene, leader of hosts,\nwho transforms me however she wants, for she has the power—\nsometimes to resemble a beggar, then again in the likeness\nof a young man, his body decked out in expensive clothes!\nEasy enough for the gods, who possess broad heaven,\nboth to exalt a mortal man, and to debase him.”\nThat said, he sat down. Telemachos, shedding tears,\ncried out, and flung his arms round his own good father,\nand a longing arose in them both for lamentation:\ntheir sobs came thicker and louder than the cries of birds,\nvultures or sea eagles with hooked talons, whose chicks\nhunters stole from their nests before they were full-fledged—\njust as piteous were their sobs and the tears they shed.\nAnd now the sun’s light would have set on their lamentation\nhad not Telemachos asked a quick question of his father:\n“On what kind of ship, dear father, was it that sailors\nbrought you here to Ithake? And who did they claim to be?\nFor I don’t imagine you made your way here on foot.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus answered him, saying:\n“So then, my child, I’ll tell you the whole true story.\nThe Phaiakians brought me here, men famous for their ships—\nother men too they convey, whoever approaches them—\nand ferrying me asleep in a swift ship over the deep\nthey set me down on Ithake, and gave me splendid gifts,\nbronze and gold in plenty, and woven clothing,\nall of which by the gods’ grace is lying stored in caves.\nAnd now I’ve come here at Athene’s instigation\nso that we may make plans together for killing our enemies.\nSo come, count up and tell me the full tally of the suitors,\nthat I may know how many, and who, these fellows are,\nand after thinking it over in my peerless mind, decide\nwhether we two are sufficient to stand against them alone,\nwithout the aid of others, or will need to round up support.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Father, I’ve always been told about your great renown,\nthat you were both a tough combatant and a shrewd planner;\nBut what you just said is too much, I’m astounded! No way\ncould two men fight so many, and strong men too!\nnot just a group of ten suitors, or even twice that,\nbut many, many more! Let me tally them for you:\nFrom Doulichion there are no fewer than fifty-two\nchosen youths, with six servants to wait on them;\nfrom Same, the count lists two dozen individuals;\nfrom Zakynthos, there are two score youths of the Achaians,\nand from Ithake itself, a dozen, all from the best families,\nand with these Medon the herald and the godlike minstrel,\nand a couple of serving men, skilled at carving roast meat.\nShould we encounter all these indoors, then bitter and desperate\nwould be the revenge that you’re here to take on their violence.\nSo, is there any supporter that you can you bring to mind,\nsomeone who’d gladly step forward to help the two of us?”\nThen much-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Well now, I’ll tell you, and you listen and pay attention,\nand decide for yourself if Athene with Zeus the Father\nwill suffice, or if I should find some other defender too.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Good indeed are these two defenders whom you mention,\nsitting high up there in the clouds: between them they rule\nthe rest of mankind, not to mention the immortal gods!”\nThen much-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Not long, for sure, will those two remain mere spectators\nof the fierce battle, when between the suitors and ourselves\nwhere Ares’ strength lies is decided, here in my halls!\nBut for now, at daybreak tomorrow you must be off\nback home, and mingle there with the arrogant suitors.\nAs for me, the swineherd will escort me later into town,\nin the likeness of a wretched and elderly beggar: and if\nin the house they mistreat me, still let the heart in your breast\nendure the sight of the pain I suffer; I may be dragged\nby the heels through the house, and then thrown out, or pelted\nwith missiles—nevertheless you must look on and bear it!\nYou can tell them to give over their mindless folly, using\ngentle words to dissuade them; but they won’t take\nany notice of you; for indeed, their fatal day is at hand!\nAnd another thing I’ll tell you, and you take it to heart:\nWhen Athene, resourceful counselor, puts it into my mind,\nI’ll nod my head to you, and you, when you see that,\nmust gather up all the weapons that are lying in the halls\nand stack them away at the back of the lofty storeroom,\nall of them; disarm the suitors with soothing words when they\nnote their absence, and start to ask you about them; say:\n‘I stored them away from the smoke, since they no longer look\nas they did when Odysseus left them on going off to Troy,\nbut are blackened with all the fire’s breath that’s got to them.\nAnd there’s a greater concern Kronos’ son has put in my mind,\nthat when you’re flushed with wine you may pick some quarrel\namong you and wound one another, and so disgrace\nyour feast and your wooing: for iron of itself attracts a man.’\n“But for us two alone leave behind two swords and two spears,\nand a couple of oxhide shields that we can heft in our hands,\nrunning up and seizing them; as for those fellows, Pallas\nAthene and Zeus the Counselor will befuddle their wits!\nAnd another thing I’ll tell you, and you take it to heart:\nIf indeed you are my son and of our blood, then don’t\nlet anyone know that Odysseus has come back home—\nDon’t break the news to Laertes, or to the swineherd, or\nto any household servant—or to Penelope herself!\nYou and I by ourselves will test the loyalty of the women,\nand also make trial of the menservants, find out which ones\nhonor the two of us, have respect for us in their hearts,\nand which are indifferent, and scorn you, man though you are.”\nThen his illustrious son responded to him, saying:\n“My father, I think you’ll find out the quality of my spirit\nsoon enough: I’m not enslaved by any slack-mindedness!\nHowever, I really think this plan of yours would profit\nneither one of us, therefore I urge you to reconsider.\nYou’d spend long hours, to no purpose, going round the estate\nmaking trial of each individual, while in your halls\nthose arrogant men, at ease, go on squandering your goods!\nRegarding the women, however, I do urge you to find out\nwhich of them disregard you, and which ones are innocent;\nbut as for the hands at the farmsteads, I’d prefer that we don’t\nmake trial of them now, but take care of that business later,\nif it’s true that you have some portent from aegis-bearing Zeus.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nBut meanwhile the well-built ship put in to Ithake\nthat had brought Telemachos and all his comrades from Pylos;\nand they, on coming into the deep-water harbor,\ndrove the black ship ashore, high up on dry land,\nwhere proud attendants unloaded their gear and promptly\ncarried off the resplendent gifts to the house of Klytios.\nThey sent a herald ahead to the house of Odysseus,\nto deliver a message to prudent Penelope—saying\nthat Telemachos had landed, but had ordered the ship\nto sail on to the city—so that the noble queen\nmight not become worried, and shed tears of tenderness.\nThe two of them, herald and swineherd, encountered each other\non the same errand, both bringing the news to Odysseus’ wife.\nSo when they arrived at the godlike queen’s abode,\nthe herald spoke up in the midst of the handmaids, saying:\n“By now, O queen, your dear son is back in this country.”\nBut the swineherd went up to Penelope, stood beside her,\nand passed on all that her dear son had told him to say;\nand when he’d delivered his whole message, he departed\nthe courtyard and hall, and went back among the pigs.\nThe suitors, however, were troubled, and downcast at heart,\nand went out from the hall past the great courtyard wall,\nand there, in front of the main gates, they sat down.\nEurymachos, Polybos’ son, was the first to address them, saying:\n“My friends, a great feat has been arrogantly accomplished\nby Telemachos—this voyage, which we thought he’d never make!\nSo now let us launch a black ship, the best one we have,\nand assemble a crew of sailors as oarsmen, who’ll bring\nword without delay to those others to sail back home at once.”\nHe’d not finished speaking when Amphinomos, looking round,\nsaw a vessel there in the deep-water harbor, its crew\nbusy furling the sail, and with oars in their hands.\nHe, with a cheerful laugh, now addressed his comrades, saying:\n“No need to send messages: here they are back home!\nEither some god told them this, or they themselves observed\nTelemachos’ ship sailing past, but couldn’t intercept it.”\nSo he spoke. They now got up and went to the seashore,\nand the crew drove the black ship ashore, high up on dry land,\nwhere proud attendants unloaded their gear, while they\nthemselves all went to assembly, but would not permit\nany others to sit with them, either young or old; and next\nEupeithes’ son Antinoos addressed them, saying: “Look here,\nsee how the gods have saved this fellow from harm!\nDay after day our lookouts perched up on the windy heights,\none succeeding another; and when the sun went down\nwe never spent nights ashore, but out on the deep sea\ncruised in a swift ship until the bright dawn came up,\nlying in wait for Telemachos, to capture and do away with\nthe man himself: but some deity brought him safely home.\nNow we here need to think up some other sorry end\nfor Telemachos, not let him escape us; I don’t think\nthat while he still lives this business of ours will flourish.\nHe himself is no slouch at planning and ideas,\nand the people here are no longer completely on our side.\nWe must act first, before this fellow brings all the Achaians\nto assembly—for I don’t think he’ll let up on us one whit,\nbut will give full play to his wrath, stand up among them all\nand report how we planned his murder, but failed to catch him;\nand they won’t approve of us on hearing of such low deeds,\nand may take low action themselves, expel us all\nfrom our homeland, so that we end up on foreign soil! We must\narrest him while he’s on his estate, well away from the city,\nor else on the road. We can then seize his property\nourselves, share it fairly between us—but leave the house\nfor his mother to occupy, and whichever man marries her.\nStill, if you dislike this proposal, would rather choose\nthat he stay alive, and keep all his ancestral wealth, then we\nshould stop consuming his nice rich store of goods\ngathering here: let each one of us rather court her\nfrom his own halls with gifts, seek to win her; she’ll then marry\nwhoever offers the most, who comes as her destined man.”\nSo he spoke, and each one of them became hushed in silence.\nAmphinomos was the next man to speak and address them,\nthe illustrious son of lord Nisos, Aretias’ son. He led\nthe suitors who came from Doulichion, rich in wheat\nand pasture; he was the one whose conversation\nmost pleased Penelope: he had an intelligent mind.\nHe, with friendly intent, now spoke before the assembly:\n“My friends, I’d myself prefer that we should not do away with\nTelemachos: it’s a most serious business, this spilling\nof royal blood. No, we must first learn the will of the gods.\nIf the ordinances of great Zeus confer their approval,\nthen I will kill him myself and urge the rest to do so;\nbut should the gods dissuade us, then I say we must desist.”\nSo spoke Amphinomos. They agreed with what he said,\nso they now got up, and left for the house of Odysseus,\nand on arrival sat down on the polished chairs there.\nNow prudent Penelope made a fresh decision: to show\nherself to her suitors, so outrageous and arrogant;\nfor she’d learnt in her halls of the plan to murder her son\nfrom Medon the herald, who’d overheard their discussion.\nNow she went down to the hall along with her handmaids;\nand when, bright among women, she reached the suitors,\nshe stood by the pillar supporting the close-packed roof,\nand, holding the shining veil in front of her face, upbraided\nAntinoos, addressing him by his name, and saying:\n“Antinoos, wantonly violent, deviser of evil! Yet they say\nthat you beat all those of your age in the land of Ithake\nas speaker and counselor! But such a man you are not!\nYou madman, why are you plotting death and destruction\nfor Telemachos? Why ignore those suppliants who have\nZeus as their witness? To plot evil against each other\nis impious! Don’t you know how your father came here in terror,\non the run from his countrymen, who were furious with him\nbecause he’d joined up with a group of Taphian pirates\nto raid the Thesprotians, when these were allies of ours?\nSo they were hot to waste him, to rip out his life spirit,\nand wholly devour his great and abundant livelihood.\nBut Odysseus held and restrained them, despite their urgency.\nIt’s his substance you eat without payment, his wife you’re courting,\nhis son whom you plan to kill. This distresses me greatly.\nSo stop it, I tell you, and make the others stop too.”\nThen Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, responded to her, saying:\n“Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelope, please don’t worry!\nYou’ve no need to let these matters disturb your mind.\nThat man does not live, nor shall do so, nor shall ever be born\nwho’ll lay violent hands on your son Telemachos\nso long as I’m still alive and have sight upon this earth!\nFor this I’ll declare to you, and indeed it shall come to pass:\nstraightway would his black blood gush out around my spear,\nsince indeed me too Odysseus, that sacker of cities,\nused often to set on his knees, would put morsels of roast\nmeat into my hands, and hold the red wine to my lips.\nSo Telemachos is by far the dearest of men to me,\nand he has no need, let me tell him, to fear death—not, at least,\nat the suitors’ hands. From the gods, there’s no dodging it.”\nThus he spoke,\nto cheer her, while planning Telemachos’ death himself.\nShe now went back to her shining upper chamber\nand there wept for Odysseus, her dear husband, until\ngrey-eyed Athene shed sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\nAt evening, the noble swineherd returned to Odysseus\nand his son, and they set about preparing their supper,\nhaving slaughtered a yearling pig. Then Athene approached,\nand standing beside Odysseus, son of Laertes, tapped him\nwith her wand, and once more made him an elderly man,\nand put threadbare clothing on him, for fear the swineherd\nmight recognize him at sight, and then go off and tell\nprudent Penelope, not keep the news to himself.\nTelemachos was the first to address the swineherd, saying:\n“You’re back, noble Eumaios! What news is there from town?\nAre the proud suitors returned by now from their ambush,\nor still watching out for me on my homeward journey?”\nTo him swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“I wasn’t concerned to go wandering all through town\nenquiring about this matter: my mind was made up\nto hurry back here once I’d delivered my message. A swift\nmessenger from your comrades then met up with me,\na herald, who was the first to break the news to your mother.\nAnd there’s one other thing I know, which I saw for myself:\nI was well up above the city—where the hill of Hermes is—\non my way, when I noticed a fast ship putting in\nto our harbor: there was a crowd of men aboard her,\nand she was loaded down with shields and two-edged spears,\nand I thought that it must be them, but I can’t be certain.”\nSo he spoke; and Telemachos, princely in power, smiled,\nwith a quick glance at his father, but avoiding the swineherd’s eye.\nWhen they’d finished their work and got their supper ready,\nthey sat down to eat: no one lacked his fair share of the meal.\nAnd when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\ntheir minds turned to rest, and they welcomed the gift of sleep.\n",

         "\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nTelemachos, dear son of godlike Odysseus, then\nfastened under his feet his fine sandals, picked out\na sturdy spear, that was comfortably fitted to his grasp,\nand, eager to leave for town, addressed the swineherd, saying:\n“Old fellow, I’m off to the city now, so that my mother\nmay actually see me: I have a feeling she won’t\ngive over her ghastly wailing and tearful lamentation\nuntil she sees me in person! Here’s what I want you to do:\nTake this unfortunate stranger into town, so he can\nbeg there for his dinner: whoever so wishes can give him\na crust and a cupful. No way can I burden myself with\nthe rest of mankind, with these troubles of my own!\nIf this angers the stranger, so much the worse for him\nwill it be: it’s my pleasure to speak the honest truth.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, neither do I myself want to be kept back here!\nFor a beggar it’s better to beg for his dinner in town\nthan out in the country: whoever so wishes can feed me.\nNo longer am I of an age to hang on here at the farmstead\nand do whatever some man in charge tells me I must!\nOff you go: this fellow here will take me as you ordered—\nwhen I’ve warmed myself at the fire, and the sun heats up!\nFor the clothes I have on are threadbare: I might be overcome\nby the dawn frost. You say, too, it’s a long way into town.”\nSo he spoke. Telemachos went out through the farmstead\nwith rapid strides, busy thinking up trouble for the suitors.\nWhen he reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, he stood\nthe spear he was carrying up against a lofty pillar,\nand himself went in, stepping over the stone threshold.\nThe first to see him by far was the old nurse Eurykleia\nas she spread fleeces over the richly decorated chairs.\nWeeping, she rushed to greet him, and the other handmaids\nof stout-hearted Odysseus now came crowding round them\nand kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome.\nNow prudent Penelope came down from her chamber,\nin appearance like Artemis, or like golden Aphrodite,\nand burst into tears as she hugged her own dear son,\nand kissed his head and both his bright shining eyes,\nand, between sobs, addressed him in winged words, saying:\n“You’re back, Telemachos, sweet light of my eyes! I thought\nI’d never see you again when you sailed off to Pylos—\nagainst my will, secretly, to seek news of your dear father!\nSo come now, tell me in detail what sightings you had of him.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Mother, don’t make me cry, don’t stir up my emotions\nwhen I’ve only just escaped sheer destruction! Instead\ngo upstairs to your chamber, take your handmaids with you,\nand wash yourself, put on a set of clean clothes,\nthen pray to all the gods, with full, perfect sacrifices,\nthat Zeus may one day enact deeds of retribution for us!\nI shall now go to the place of assembly, and invite home\nthe guest that came with me on my voyage back from Pylos.\nI sent him on ahead with my godlike comrades, and told\nPeiraios to take him back to his house, and give him\na kindly welcome, look after him till I myself arrived.”\nSo he spoke: her own answer remained unwinged.\nShe washed herself, and put on a set of clean clothes,\nand vowed to make full, perfect sacrifices to all\nthe gods if Zeus would enact deeds of retribution for them.\nTelemachos made his way out through the hall, his spear\ngrasped in one hand, two hunting dogs following at his heels,\nand marvelous was the grace that Athene shed upon him,\nso that all the people gazed at him in amazement as he came,\nand the haughty suitors now gathered all around him,\nspeaking fair words, but privately plotting trouble.\nHe, however, avoided the main crowd, and went over\nto where Mentor, Antiphos, and Halitherses were sitting,\nmen who from the start had been his father’s comrades,\nand sat with them, and they questioned him on every detail\nof his trip. Peiraios, famed spearman, then came over,\nbringing the stranger through the city to the assembly.\nTelemachos was not slow to join his guest, but approached him.\nFirst to speak was Peiraios, who now addressed him, saying:\n“Telemachos, send women over to my house now, at once,\nso I can deliver to you the gifts Menelaos gave you.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Peiraios, we don’t yet know how this business may turn out.\nIf the haughty suitors secretly slay me in my own halls,\nand share out all my family goods between them, then\nI want you, not one of them, to keep and enjoy these things;\nBut if I contrive death and destiny for that lot, then\nbring all the stuff to my house, and I’ll be glad to get it.”\nThat said, he took the stranger, so sorely tried, back home.\nWhen they reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, they took off\ntheir cloaks and laid them on the seats and the high chairs\nand went off to the polished bathtubs and had baths.\nAfter the handmaids had washed them, massaged them with oil,\nand dressed them in woolen mantles and tunics, they came\nout from the bathtubs and seated themselves on the chairs,\nand a servant brought hand-washing water in a beautiful\ngolden ewer and poured it over a silver basin\nso they could wash, and drew up a polished table for them.\nThe respected housekeeper brought in bread and served it\nalong with many side dishes, giving freely of what there was.\nHis mother sat facing Telemachos by the hall’s main pillar,\nsettled back in her chair, spinning fine yarn on her distaff.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nit was prudent Penelope who opened the conversation, saying:\n“Telemachos, I’m going back now to my upper chamber,\nto lie down on my bed, that’s become a bed of sorrow,\nalways damp with my tears, ever since Odysseus set out\nwith the sons of Atreus for Ilion. Yet you couldn’t be bothered,\nbefore the haughty suitors arrived in the house, to tell me\nany clear news you may have about your father’s return.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“Very well, mother, I’ll give you a true and complete account.\nWe traveled to Pylos, to Nestor, shepherd of the people,\nwho gave me a warm welcome in his lofty dwelling\nas an honored guest, the way a father might treat his son\nback home from a long spell abroad: with just such kindness\nhe looked after me, both he and his glorious sons.\nBut of steadfast-minded Odysseus, living or dead, he told me\nhe’d heard not one thing, from any man on earth.\nHe sent me to Atreus’ son, famed spearman Menelaos,\nin a carpentered chariot drawn by his own horses;\nand there I saw Argive Helen, on whose account, and by\nthe gods’ will, Argives and Trojans endured such hardship.\nThen straight off Menelaos, good at the war cry, asked me\nwhat it was I’d come in search of to lordly Lakedaimon.\nWhereupon I then told him the whole truth of the matter.\nAt this he responded to me with the following statement:\n‘I tell you, it was indeed in the bed of a brave warrior\nthat these fellows, cowards themselves, hoped they might lie!\nAs when in a thicket, the lair of a powerful lion,\na doe has laid to sleep her newborn suckling fawns\nand goes off, traversing foothills and grassy glens\nin search of pasture, and the lion returns to his den\nand on both her fawns unleashes a ghastly fate—just so\nwill Odysseus unleash a ghastly fate on these men!\nHow I wish—by Zeus the Father and Athene and Apollo!—\nthat he, as strong as he was that time in well-built Lesbos\nwhen he stood up and wrestled a bout with Philomeleides,\nand threw him down forcefully, and all the Achaians cheered,\nmight come—he, Odysseus—in such strength among these suitors!\nThen they’d all get a swift end and a bitter marriage!\nAs regards the business you’re enquiring about, I shan’t\nveer off onto other subjects, nor will I mislead you—\nof all that I heard from that forthright Old Man of the Sea\nnot one word will I keep back or conceal from you!\nHe said he’d seen Odysseus on an island, much frustrated,\nin the halls of the nymph Kalypso, who by constraint\ndetains him there, so he can’t get back to his own country:\nfor he has no ships with oars, nor any comrades\nto further his voyage over the broad back of the sea.’\n“So spoke Atreus’ son, the famed spearman Menelaos.\nWhen I’d done all this, I set out: the immortals gave me\na following wind, and a speedy voyage to my own country.”\nSo he spoke, and stirred the heart in her breast with his words.\nThen the godlike Theoklymenos also addressed them, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, truly\nyour son knows nothing for certain!! Listen rather to me,\nfor I shall foretell the truth to you, hold back nothing!\nZeus, first of gods, be my witness, and this guest-friendly board,\nand the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\nthat Odysseus is already here, in his own homeland, sitting\nquiet or stealing about, learning of these misdeeds,\nand planting the seeds of destruction for all the suitors:\nsuch the bird portent I noted as I sat on the well-benched\nship of Telemachos here, and duly expounded to him.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“If only these words of yours, stranger, might be fulfilled!\nThen would you quickly know friendship and gifts in plenty\nfrom me, so that any who met you would call you blessed.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nMeanwhile, out in front of Odysseus’ house, the suitors\nwere amusing themselves by throwing discus and javelin\non the leveled terrace as always, in their arrogance. But when\nthe time for dinner arrived, and the flocks were coming home\nfrom the fields on every side, led by their usual herdsmen,\nthen they were summoned by Medon—who pleased them best\nof the heralds, and was present at their dinners—saying:\n“Young men, now you’ve all pleasured your hearts with sport,\ncome on into the house, so we can get dinner ready,\nfor it’s no bad thing to have meals at the proper time.”\nSo he spoke, and they stood up and obeyed his summons.\nWhen they entered the pleasantly sited house they took off\ntheir cloaks and laid them down on the chairs and benches,\nand set about slaughtering big sheep and fattened goats,\nand plumped-up porkers, and a cow from the herd, as they\nmade ready their meal.\nNow Odysseus and the noble swineherd\nwere preparing to leave the countryside, go in to town;\nand the swineherd, leader of men, spoke first, declaring:\n“Stranger, since you’re so eager to go off into the city\ntoday, as my master commanded—though I myself\nwould rather have left you here to watch over the farmstead—\nnevertheless I respect him, and fear that he might\nreprimand me later, and a master’s rebukes can be harsh—\ncome on now, let’s be going: the day is nearly over,\nit will soon be evening, and a little too cold for you.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\nBut yes, let’s be going. Be my guide all the way. And give me—\nif there’s one around that’s been cut for your use—a strong\nstaff to support me. You said the road was uneven.”\nWith that he slung over his shoulder his worn-out leather bag,\ntattered and rent, which was held by a twisted cord,\nand Eumaios gave him a staff that was to his liking,\nand the two set out. Dogs and herdsmen were left behind\nto look after the farmstead, while the swineherd led his master\ninto town, in the guise of a miserable aged beggar\npropped on a staff, wearing mean and threadbare clothes.\nBut when, as they made their way along the stony path,\nthey’d come close to the city, and had reached a spring, from which,\npaved and fair-flowing, the townsfolk got their water—\ndeveloped by Ithakos, Neritos, and Polyktor,\nwith a grove of black waterside poplars that encircled it\non every side, and the chill water came flowing down\nfrom the rocks above, and up high there was built an altar\nto the nymphs, where all travelers made offerings—there\nMelanthios son of Dolios overtook them while driving\nthose she-goats that were the very best from all his herds\nfor the suitors’ dinner; two herdsmen accompanied him.\nWhen he saw them, he reviled them, addressing them personally\nin aggressive, unseemly terms, that enraged Odysseus’ heart:\n“Now here comes a total no-good leading a no-good! As usual,\nthe god’s bringing like and like together! Where, pray,\nyou wretched swineherd, are you taking this old bald pig,\nthis tiresome beggar, this walking blot on our feasts?\nHe’ll stand and rub his shoulders at many doorposts,\nbegging for scraps, but never for swords or cauldrons!\nIf you gave me this dolt to be a guard on my farmstead,\nto sweep out the pens and fetch green shoots for the kids,\nthen by drinking whey he could build up his thigh muscles!\nBut since all he’s learned is bad stuff, he won’t be willing\nto do real work—he’d rather slouch his way through\nthis district begging, to feed his bottomless belly!\nI’ll tell you one thing straight, that will certainly come to pass:\nif he hangs around the residence of godlike Odysseus, then\nthere’ll be plenty of footstools shied by men at his head\nthat his ribs will splinter as he’s pelted throughout the house.”\nSo he spoke. As he passed, in his folly he kicked Odysseus\non the hip, yet failed to knock him clear of the path.\nOdysseus stood there unshaken, pondering whether\nhe should attack with his staff, and beat the life out of him,\nor collar him by the waist, dash his head on the ground.\nBut he steeled himself, and endured. The swineherd stared\nin rebuke at this fellow, raised his arms, and prayed aloud:\n“You nymphs of the spring, Zeus’ daughters, if Odysseus\never burned thigh pieces for you, wrapped in rich fat,\nof lambs or kids, then grant me fulfillment of this prayer:\nmay that man, my master, return, and divinity guide him!\nThen would he scatter all those glorious airs that you\nflaunt in your arrogance now, always strutting around\nthis township, while useless herdsmen bring the flocks to ruin.”\nThe goatherd Melanthios responded to him, saying:\n“My oh my, how this dog rants, mind full of malice!\nOne day I’ll carry him off in a well-benched black ship,\nfar away from Ithake, where he might bring me a fortune.\nOh, I wish silver-bowed Apollo would strike down Telemachos\ntoday in his halls, or the suitors would kill him, as surely\nas for Odysseus, far off, the day of return’s been lost.”\nSo saying, he left them behind there, as they walked slowly on,\nwhile he moved fast, and soon reached his master’s house.\nHe went straight in, and sat down among the suitors,\nfacing Eurymachos, the friend whom he liked the best.\nThe carvers set before him a portion of roast meat, while\nthe respected housekeeper brought him bread, and placed it\nready to eat. Now Odysseus and the noble swineherd\nstopped when they got near; about them rang the notes\nof the hollow lyre, for Phemios was preparing to sing for them.\nThen Odysseus clutched the swineherd’s hand, and said:\n“Eumaios, surely this is Odysseus’ fine house? It’s easily\ndistinguishable from the rest, even when there are many.\nOne building’s linked to another, and the courtyard’s fitted\nwith wall and copestones, its doors are finely worked\nand double-paneled: no man could furnish it better. And I\nobserve that within there’s a feast for many in progress,\nfor the smell of roast meat rises from it, and within it echoes\nthe lyre, made by the gods an accompaniment to feasting.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“Easily did you know it, for in all else you don’t lack sense.\nBut now we have to think how we shall act next.\nYou could go first into this pleasantly sited house,\nand mix with the suitors, while I stay out here. Or else,\nif you like, you stay here, and I’ll go in before you.\nBut don’t linger outside too long, or someone might notice,\nand hit you or chase you off. Do please be careful.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\nYou go on ahead, and I’ll stay behind out here—\nI’m not unused to being hit, or having things thrown at me.\nMy spirit is steadfast, for I’ve suffered many setbacks\nfrom rough seas and in war: let this be added to them!\nBut a ravening belly there’s no way of concealing—\nan accursed plague, that brings many evils upon mankind.\nFor its sake, too, well-benched ships are armed and sent\nout on the unharvested sea, bearing ills to their enemies.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nNow a dog lying there raised its head and pricked up its ears—\nArgos, stout-hearted Odysseus’ dog, that he, years ago,\nhad bred up himself, but got no joy of, departing too soon\nfor sacred Ilion. Young hunters used to take Argos\nto go in pursuit of wild goats, or deer, or hares; but now\nhe lay neglected, his master long since absent,\nin the abundant dung of the mules and oxen left\noutside the gates, until the servants of Odysseus\ncarted it off to manure his widespread estate. There lay\nthe dog Argos now, his body crawling with dog ticks.\nBut the moment he sensed that it was Odysseus nearby\nhe wagged his tail and laid back both ears, and yet\nno longer had the strength to move any closer to\nhis master, who now looked away, and wiped off a tear\nthat he easily hid from Eumaios, then questioned him, saying:\n“Eumaios, it’s odd, this dog lying here in the dung—\nhe has a good body, but I still can’t really be certain\nif he once had the speed to match his fine appearance,\nor was nothing more than one of those table dogs\nthat their masters take care of only to put on a show.”\nTo him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“This is indeed the dog of a man who died far away.\nIf he were such today, in body and performance,\nas he was when Odysseus left him, and set out for Troy,\nyou’d at once be astonished on seeing his speed and strength!\nNo wild beast that he started in the thick woodland’s depths\never escaped him. He was also a keen-nosed tracker.\nBut now he’s in a poor way, and his master has perished\nfar from his homeland. The women are heedless, can’t be bothered\nto care for him. Servants no longer directed by their master\nwon’t perform their duties properly any more,\nfor far-seeing Zeus strips away half the proper worth\nfrom any man, once the day of slavery overtakes him.”\nSo saying, he went on into the pleasantly sited building\nand made straight for the hall to join the noble suitors.\nBut Argos the fated lot of black death overwhelmed\nonce he’d seen Odysseus again, in the twentieth year.\nGodlike Telemachos was the first by far to notice\nthe swineherd advancing through the house, and at once\ninvited him with a nod. Eumaios looked round and seized\na nearby stool, on which the carver would sit to cut\nall the portions of meat for the suitors feasting there\nin the hall. This he took and placed at Telemachos’ table,\nopposite him, and sat down himself. A herald now set\na portion of meat before him, with bread from a basket.\nVery soon after him Odysseus entered the building\nas he was, in the guise of a miserable aged beggar\npropped on a staff, wearing mean and threadbare clothes.\nHe sat down on the ash-wood threshold inside the doorway,\nleaning back on the doorpost of cypress, which long ago\na craftsman had skillfully planed and made true to the line.\nTelemachos now beckoned the swineherd over to him,\ntook a whole loaf from the exquisite basket, together\nwith all the meat he could pick up in both hands, and said:\n“Take this, a gift for the stranger. Tell him he should himself\ngo round among all the suitors, begging. Embarrassed restraint\nis not a useful emotion for a man who’s in need.”\nSo he spoke;\nthe swineherd, on hearing his order, went up to Odysseus,\nand standing close, addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Stranger, Telemachos gives you this, says you should\ngo round among all the suitors, begging. Embarrassed restraint\nis not a useful emotion, he says, for a man who begs.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Zeus, lord, grant that Telemachos prosper among his peers,\nand may all that his heart desires be accomplished for him.”\nWith that he received the food in both hands and laid it\ndown at his feet on his tattered old leather bag and ate\nwhile the minstrel was still performing there in the hall.\nBut when he’d eaten dinner, and the divine minstrel was done,\nthe suitors’ noisy clamor resumed in the hall. Now Athene,\nstanding close beside Odysseus, Laertes son, urged him on,\nto go round among the suitors, collect his crusts of bread,\ndiscover which were right-thinking, which lawless. Yet even so\nshe’d no plan to save a single one of them from destruction.\nOff he went to beg of them, moving from left to right,\nwith outstretched hand all round, as though he’d long been at it.\nThey felt pity, and gave, and regarded him with wonder,\nquestioning who he might be, and where he came from.\nThe goatherd Melanthios now addressed them, saying:\n“Listen to me, you suitors of our illustrious queen!\nAbout this stranger: I’ve actually seen him before—in fact\nit was the swineherd who brought him back here, but I\ndon’t know the man himself, or who he claims as family.”\nSo he spoke. Antinoos then chastised the swineherd, saying:\n“You infamous swineherd, why did you bring this fellow\nhere into town? Don’t we have enough vagrants already,\nthese tiresome beggars who disrupt our feasts? Is it not\nenough for you that such men should cluster here and guzzle\nour lord’s livelihood, that you bring in this fellow too?”\nTo him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“High-born you may be, Antinoos, but that was not well said.\nFor who’d himself seek out and invite any stranger\nfrom abroad, except maybe some kind of public worker—\na prophet, a healer of sickness, a carpenter—even a godlike\nminstrel, who gives delight with his singing? Such men\nare invited worldwide on mankind’s boundless earth,\nbut no man would bring in a beggar to devour his substance!\nYou’re always too severe, more than the rest of the suitors,\non Odysseus’ servants, on me above all—although\nI don’t care, so long as prudent Penelope and godlike\nTelemachos are here, both still living in these halls.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Silence! Never waste words in answering this man!\nAntinoos has an old habit of meanly provoking people\nwith his rough language, and urges others to do the same.”\nThat said, he addressed Antinoos with winged words, saying:\n“Antinoos, truly you care for me like a father his son, the way\nyou tell me to drive this stranger away from our halls with words\nof enforcement! May no god bring this about! Take something,\nand give it him! Far from begrudging you, I command it!\nDon’t worry about my mother, or the rest of the household\nservants resident here in the house of godlike Odysseus!\nBut in fact this isn’t the kind of thought in your breast:\nyou’d far rather eat yourself than give to somebody else.”\nTo him then in turn Antinoos responded: “Telemachos,\nhigh-flown speaker, in anger unbridled, what’s this you said?\nIf all the suitors would offer him just what I do, then\nfor three months this house would keep him at a distance!”\nSo saying, he seized and brought out from beneath the table\nthe footstool on which he rested his sleek feet while feasting.\nThe others, more generous, filled Odysseus’ old bag\nwith crusts and meat. Now Odysseus was on his way\nback to the entrance, after making free trial of the Achaians,\nbut he stopped by Antinoos, and said to him: “Give, friend!\nYou don’t look to me like the meanest of the Achaians,\nbut rather the noblest, for you have the air of a king!\nSo it’s right that you should give me an even larger portion\nof food than the rest, and I’d spread your fame worldwide!\nFor I too once dwelt in my own rich house among other\nprosperous men, and I often would give to a vagrant,\nno matter what sort he was or what he might be lacking!\nCountless servants I had, and much else in abundance\nowning which men live well, and are known as wealthy.\nBut Kronos’ son Zeus lost me all—on some whim, I suppose—\nby inciting me to go off, with a bunch of roving pirates\nto Egypt—a lengthy voyage—and meet my ruin there.\nWell, in the river of Egypt I anchored my curved vessels.\nThen I issued orders to my trusty comrades, to stay\nthere with the ships, and to be those ships’ protectors\nwhile I sent off scouts to find and man lookout posts.\nBut, trusting their strength, they yielded to wanton aggression,\nand at once began ravaging the Egyptians’ splendid fields,\ncarrying off their wives and their little children,\nand killing the men. Word quickly reached the city,\nand, hearing the shouting, people came out at daybreak.\nThe whole plain filled up with infantry and horses\nand the bright glint of bronze. Zeus, hurler of thunderbolts,\ncast a craven panic upon my comrades: nobody dared\nto stand firm and face the foe, for trouble confronted us\non every side. Many of us they slew with the sharp bronze;\nothers they led off alive, to do forced labor for them.\nBut me they sent on to Cyprus with a chance-met stranger,\nDmetor, Iasos’ son, a powerful Cypriot prince.\nFrom there I’ve come here, with much hardship on the way.”\nTo him Antinoos then responded, saying: “What god\nhas delivered this nuisance, this spoiler of feasts, to us?\nYou, keep your distance, stand well away from my table,\nor you’ll soon find yourself in a bitter Egypt and Cyprus,\nthe right place for the bold and shameless beggar you are!\nYou make your pitch to each man in turn, and they give\nthoughtlessly, since there’s no restraint and no compunction\nin handing out other men’s stuff, and everyone has so much.”\nAt this resourceful Odysseus took a step back, and said:\n“I see your mind’s no match for your looks! You wouldn’t\nspare even salt from your home store for your own suppliant,\nand though at another man’s table, you’re still reluctant\nto break off a crust and give it me! Yet there’s plenty here.”\nSo he spoke, and Antinoos grew yet more enraged at heart.\nStaring angrily, he addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Indeed, you’ll no longer get safely back, I think,\nout through this hall, now you’re bandying insults too.”\nSo saying, he threw the footstool, struck Odysseus’ right shoulder\nat the base, where it joins the back; but he stood rock firm.\nAntinoos’ missile failed to floor him. He said nothing,\njust shook his head, mind deeply pondering trouble. Then\nhe made his way back to the threshold and seated himself,\nand set down his well-filled bag, and addressed the suitors, saying:\n“Listen to me, you suitors of the illustrious queen,\nto what the heart in my breast now urges me to tell you!\nThere’s no pain felt by the mind, nor any sorrow, when\na man takes a hit who’s fighting to save his own possessions—\ncattle, maybe, or flocks of white sheep—but Antinoos\nstruck me because of my wretched belly, that damnable\nplague, the source of so much trouble for mankind!\nIf beggars have their own gods or Furies, then may death’s\nend find Antinoos before ever he comes to marriage!”\nThen Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, responded to him, saying:\n“Sit still and eat quietly, stranger, or go off somewhere else,\nor the young men may seize you, by hand or foot, for the way\nyou talk, and tear you apart, and throw you out of the house.”\nSo he spoke, indignant and headstrong, but they all rebuked him,\nand thus would one of these overproud youths address him:\n“Antinoos, you did wrong to strike this luckless vagrant!\nIf he turns out to be some god from heaven, you’re done for!\nAnd the gods do assume the form of some stranger from afar,\ntake on any shape, to wander through our cities\nobserving both good governance and its violent transgressions.”\nSo spoke the suitors; but he paid no heed to their words,\nand Telemachos nursed great sorrow at heart because\nof the blow to his father, yet shed no tear on the ground\nbut just shook his head, mind deeply pondering trouble.\nWhen prudent Penelope was informed about the assault\non the man in the hall, she exclaimed, among her handmaids:\n“May Apollo, renowned archer, so strike you yourself!”\nTo her then responded Eurynome, the housekeeper, saying:\n“Would that our prayers might find fulfillment! Then not\none of these men would live till another fine-throned Dawn.”\nPrudent Penelope replied to her, saying: “Good mother,\nthey’re all our enemies, since they’re plotting trouble for us;\nbut Antinoos is the worst, he’s like black death!\nSome luckless stranger’s been going round in the house\nbegging from all the men, driven to it by poverty.\nAll the rest gave him enough to fill his bag, but this man\nthrew a footstool and struck him, low down on his right shoulder.”\nSuch her words while she sat in her room, conversing\nwith her handmaids, and noble Odysseus was eating his scraps.\nThen she sent for the noble swineherd, and addressed him, saying:\n“Go now, noble Eumaios, invite this stranger here:\nI’d like to show him some kindness—and ask him if perhaps\nhe’s had has some news of steadfast-minded Odysseus,\nor has actually seen him: he seems to be widely traveled.”\nThen to her, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Indeed, my queen, I could wish these Achaians would be silent,\nhe spins such a tale as would enchant your very soul!\nThree nights I had him with me, and three days I kept him\nin my hut—he first came to me after he jumped ship,\nbut that wasn’t the end of the tale of hardship he told me.\nLike the man gazing rapt at a minstrel performing lays that\nhe’s learned from the gods for the entrancement of mortals,\nwho are ceaselessly eager to hear him, whenever he sings—\nthat’s how this fellow charmed me as he sat in my home.\nHe says he’s a family guest-friend of Odysseus, and dwells\nin Krete, that place where the line of Minos holds sway.\nNow he’s come here from there, with much hardship on the way,\nwandering ever onward. He’s had news of Odysseus, he says:\nquite near, in the Thesprotians’ rich terrain, alive,\nand bringing much treasure back with him to his home.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Go, summon him! He can tell me all this, face to face.\nAs for these men sitting outside or here indoors, enjoying\na good time, let them go on, since that’s their fancy!\nTheir own possessions, bread and sweet wine, are left\nuntouched in their homes, and are eaten by their servants,\nwhile they themselves, day in day out, flock to our house,\nslaughter our cattle and sheep and fatted goats, hold feasts\nat which they swill down our bright red wine without\nany restraint. Most is gone now, for there is no man here\nsuch as Odysseus once was, to keep ruin from our house.\nBut were Odysseus to come back home, then he and his son\nwould at once exact vengeance for these men’s violent acts.”\nSo she spoke. Telemachos now sneezed, loudly. The whole\nhouse echoed ringingly round them. Penelope laughed,\nand at once addressed Eumaios with winged words, saying:\n“Please go now and bring the stranger here before me!\nDon’t you see how my son just sneezed at everything I said?\nIt follows that death shall not be unfulfilled for the suitors—\nto the last man: not one shall escape death and the fates.\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nIf I find that in all he relates he speaks only truth,\nthen I’ll dress him in mantle and tunic, the very best there are.”\nSo she spoke. The swineherd went, on hearing her words,\nto Odysseus, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Stranger, father, prudent Penelope wants to see you—\nTelemachos’ mother: her heart bids her make enquiries\nabout her husband, although she’s suffered much already.\nIf she finds that in all you relate you speak only truth,\nthen she’ll dress you in mantle and tunic—things of which\nyou stand much in need! As for food, go beg through the land\nto keep your belly well fed: those who so choose will give.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“In a moment, Eumaios, I’ll be relating the whole truth\nto Ikarios’ daughter, the prudent Penelope! My knowledge\nof Odysseus is sound, and we’ve borne like hardships. But\nI’m much afraid of this crowd of dangerous suitors,\nwhose aggression and violence reach up to the iron heaven!\nFor just now, as I went through the hall, doing no harm,\nthis man struck me, causing much pain, yet neither\nTelemachos nor anyone else came out to protect me.\nSo tell Penelope she must wait in the halls, however\nimpatient she may be, until the sun goes down:\nthen let her ask me about the day of her husband’s return,\nand give me a seat that’s nearer the fire, since my clothes\nare threadbare. You know this yourself: I appealed to you first.”\nSo he spoke. The swineherd then, after hearing his words,\nwent back in. Penelope at once addressed him, saying:\n“You haven’t brought him, Eumaios! What’s this vagrant up to?\nIs he scared without reason of someone, or maybe embarrassed\nhere in the house? Embarrassment makes a useless beggar.”\nTo her then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“What he says is well chosen, as anyone else would agree:\nhe hopes to avoid the violence of these arrogant men,\nso he wants you to wait to see him until the sun goes down.\nFor yourself too, my queen, it would indeed be far better\nto speak with the stranger, and hear what he says, alone.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“This stranger’s not witless: he figures how things may go.\nFor there may well be no other mortal men alive\nwho in their violence contrive such reckless acts as these.”\nSo she spoke, and the noble swineherd then departed\nand joined the throng of the suitors after he’d told her all.\nAt once he addressed winged words to Telemachos, head\nheld close, so that nobody else could hear him, saying:\n“Friend, I’m off out there now to guard the pigs and the rest—\nyour and my livelihood. You take charge of everything here.\nAbove all, keep yourself safe, take good care you don’t run\ninto trouble: many Achaians now have it in for you—\nmay Zeus destroy them utterly before harm can befall us!”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Old fellow, so it shall be. Off you go when you’ve had some food.\nBut come back tomorrow with fine sacrificial victims!\nAll here will be cared for by me. And by the immortals.”\nSo he spoke. The swineherd sat down again on a polished\nchair, and when he’d satisfied his desire for food and drink,\nhe went back to his pigs, leaving the courts and the hall\nfull of banqueters. Now they began to enjoy themselves with\ndancing and singing, for already the evening had arrived.\n",

         "\nNow there came up a public beggar, whose custom it was to beg\nthrough the town of Ithake, well known for his ravenous belly,\nforever guzzling and swilling. There was no strength in him,\nnor force; yet his great bulk made an imposing sight.\nHis name was Arnaios: this his lady mother had given him\nat birth. But Iros was his nickname with all the young men\nbecause he used to run errands for anyone who would ask him.\nUp he came now, bent on chasing Odysseus away\nfrom his own home, and began, with winged words, to upbraid him:\n“Out of this entrance, old man, before someone drags you off\nby the foot! Don’t you see how everyone’s winking at me,\nencouraging me to drag you? Yet I’m ashamed to do it.\nSo up with you now, or our quarrel will soon come to fisticuffs!”\nWith an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n“Sir, neither by words nor by action am I causing you harm,\nnor do I resent someone treating you—however large the helping!\nThis threshold has room for us both, nor is there need for you\nto be jealous of others. It seems to me you’re a vagrant\nas I am. Prosperity is something the gods will allot. But don’t\nprovoke me too much with your fists, lest you rouse my wrath,\nand, old man though I am, I spatter your breast and lips\nwith your blood! Then I’d enjoy much greater peace and quiet\ntomorrow, since I don’t think you’d then come back\na second time to the hall of Laertes’ son Odysseus.”\nNow Iros the vagrant grew angry, and addressed him, saying:\n“Oh my, how glibly this bald old pig rants on,\nlike some crone by the oven! But I’ll contrive trouble for him,\npunch him out with both hands, scatter all the teeth\nfrom his jaws on the ground, as I’d treat a crop-rooting sow!\nCome, gird yourself now, let all these men get to watch us\nfighting! Yet how could you ever stand up to a younger man?”\nSo these two, there in front of the lofty doorway\non the polished threshold were taunting each other sharply;\nAntinoos, princely in power, now noticed them at it,\nand, with a light laugh, addressed the suitors, saying:\n“Never before, my friends, has anything happened to match\nthe sport that some god’s brought to this house! The stranger\nand Iros are challenging one another to a fistfight!\nso gather round quickly, let’s make a real match of it!”\nSo he spoke. They all sprang to their feet, with laughter,\nand crowded about this couple of tatterdemalion beggars.\nAntinoos, son of Eupeithes, then addressed them, saying:\n“Listen, all you proud suitors, to what I have to say!\nThese goats’ paunches over the fire, set there for our supper,\nthat we filled first with fat and blood —let whichever of these two\nemerges victorious, proves himself the better man,\nstand up and take for himself the one that he chooses.\nWhat’s more, he shall always feast with us, nor will we allow\nany other beggar to join us or to beg among us.”\nSo Antinoos spoke: what he said was to their liking.\nThen with crafty intent resourceful Odysseus declared:\n“Friends, there’s no way an old man worn out by grief\ncan fight with a younger opponent; and yet my belly,\nthat worker of evil, urges me to succumb to his attacks!\nBut come now, all of you swear me a mighty oath\nthat no one, backing Iros, will strike me a foul blow\nin reckless mood, and use force to let this fellow beat me.”\nSo he spoke, and they all swore the oath as he requested.\nBut when they’d sworn, and completed the oath-taking, then\nTelemachos, princely in power, addressed them once more, saying:\n“Stranger, if your heart and proud spirit are urging you\nto beat off this man, have no fear of any other Achaian:\nany man who strikes you will be up against many more!\nI myself am your host, accepted by these two princes,\nAntinoos and Eurymachos, sagacious men both of them.”\nSo he spoke, and they all applauded. And now Odysseus\ngirded his rags about his loins, revealing his thighs,\nboth muscled and large, and his broad shoulders appeared,\nand his chest and his powerful forearms. Also Athene\ncame close and magnified the limbs of the people’s shepherd,\nso that even the suitors condescendingly admired them,\nand thus would one of them speak, with a glance at his neighbor:\n“Soon will Iros, un-Irosed, have a loss of his own making,\nso muscled a thigh does the old man reveal beneath his rags.”\nSo he spoke, and Iros’ spirit was severely shaken.\nYet even so the serving men made him gird up his rags\nand forced him out, terrified, the flesh shivering on his limbs.\nThen Antinoos addressed a scathing rebuke to him, saying:\n“Better for you, you braggart, had you never been born\nif you tremble in front of this man and are so afraid of him—\nsomeone so old, so broken by the hardship he’s suffered!\nI’ll tell you this straight out, and it’ll happen for sure:\nif he’s victorious, proves himself the better man,\nI’ll clap you in a black ship, send you off to the mainland,\nto King Echetos, dangerous maimer of all mortal men alive,\nwho’ll cut off your nose and ears with the pitiless bronze,\nand rip out your privates, give them raw to the dogs to eat.”\nSo he spoke, and yet greater trembling seized on Iros’ limbs\nas they led him out to the middle. Both men put up their hands.\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus was debating in his mind\nwhether to slam him so hard that life left him as he fell,\nor hit him just hard enough to stretch him out on the ground;\nand as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\nto hit him lightly, and not arouse Achaian suspicions.\nSo after they raised their hands Iros led to the right shoulder,\nbut Odysseus struck his neck beneath the ear. The blow\ncrushed in the bones. At once red blood filled his mouth,\nhe fell in the dust with a cry, and gnashed his teeth,\nand drummed on the ground with his feet. The lordly suitors,\narms raised, nearly died laughing. And then Odysseus\ndragged him out by his foot through the doorway to the courtyard\nand the gates of the colonnade. There he propped him sitting\nagainst the courtyard wall, thrust a staff into his hand,\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “Now sit there,\nto scare off the pigs and dogs! And stop pretending\nto lord it over strangers and beggars, you wretch,\nor you may well bring a yet worse disaster upon you!”\nWith that he slung over his shoulder his worn-out leather bag,\ntattered and rent, which was held by a twisted cord,\nand went back to the threshold and sat there. The suitors\ncame inside laughing gaily, and congratulated him, saying:\n“May Zeus and the other gods, stranger, grant you all\nthat you most desire, the dearest wish of your heart,\nfor you’ve ended the begging routine of this insatiable fellow\nin our neighborhood! Soon we’ll send him across to the mainland\nto King Echetos, dangerous maimer of all mortal men alive!”\nSo they spoke, and Odysseus rejoiced at the words of omen,\nand Antinoos set before him the great paunch, filled\nwith fat and blood, while Amphinomos chose two loaves,\ntook them out of the basket, and set these too before him,\nand pledged him, holding a golden cup, and addressed him, saying:\n“Your health, father and stranger: may prosperity hereafter\nattend you, though now you’re beset by many troubles.”\nTo him resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n“Amphinomos, you strike me as a highly sagacious man,\nsuch a one as your father was, whose reputation I knew of:\nDoulichian Nisos, a man both valiant and wealthy.\nThey say you’re his son: you seem a well-mannered person,\nso I’ve something to tell you: please listen and pay attention.\nThis earth nurtures nothing of less account than man\namong all creatures that breathe and move upon it;\nfor he thinks he’ll not suffer setbacks in the years ahead\nso long as the gods grant him prowess and his knees are nimble;\nand when the blessed gods bring him hard times, this too,\nthough against his will, he endures with a stubborn heart,\nfor the spirit of men on this earth will meet and match\nthe day that the Father of gods and men brings on them.\nI too was once on the way to a good life among my fellows,\nbut, yielding to strength and violence, did many reckless deeds,\nbecause I trusted my father and the rest of my kinsmen.\nSo no man should ever use lawlessness, on any occasion,\nbut accept in silence those gifts that the gods may give him.\nSuch reckless acts I now witness the suitors committing,\nas they squander the goods and show no respect for the wife\nof a man who, I tell you, won’t be absent much longer\nfrom his friends and country—he’s close! May some god rather\nlead you home out of here, so you don’t encounter him\nwhen he’s back in his native setting, for not bloodless, I think,\nwill be the final reckoning between that man and the suitors,\nonce he’s made it home and is under his own roof.”\nSo saying, he poured a libation, and drank the honey-sweet wine,\nand then returned the cup to the commander of the people.\nBut Amphinomos went through the hall deeply worried at heart,\nhead bowed, for his spirit clearly foresaw disaster.\nYet he still failed to dodge his fate, since Athene bound him\nto be violently overwhelmed by Telemachos’ hands and spear.\nNow he sat down again in the chair from which he’d risen.\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put a thought in the mind\nof Ikarios’ daughter, the prudent Penelope: that she\nshould appear now before the suitors, flutter their hearts\nto the utmost, and thus win still greater appreciation\nfrom her husband and son than they’d accorded her hitherto.\nWith an awkward laugh, she addressed her housekeeper, saying:\n“Eurynome, I’m now minded, as I’ve never been before,\nto show myself to the suitors, hateful though I still find them.\nAnd I want a word with my son, to tell him he’d do better\nnot to consort so much with these overweening suitors,\nwho treat him politely, but are plotting his downfall later.”\nThen Eurynome, housekeeper, responded to her, saying:\n“All this indeed, child, was well and properly spoken.\nGo now, have a word with your son, don’t hold it back!\nBut wash yourself first, and rub oil into your cheeks—\ndon’t go as you are, leaving your face all tear-stained:\navoid indiscriminate mourning, day in day out! Your son\nhas now attained the age that you begged the immortals most\nto allow you to see: he’s become a bearded adult.”\nTo her then prudent Penelope now responded, saying:\n“Eurynome, don’t, though you care for me, try to talk me\ninto washing my body or massaging myself with oil!\nAny beauty I once had the gods, who possess Olympos,\ndestroyed, from the day when he left with the hollow ships!\nBut go tell Autonoe now, along with Hippodameia,\nto come here: I want them beside me in the hall.\nI won’t go in to the men alone: I’d be ashamed to.”\nSo she spoke, and out through the hall the old woman went\nto take these handmaids the message, request their presence.\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another idea:\non Ikarios’ daughter she shed sweet sleep: she lay back\nand dozed, there in her recliner; all her joints were relaxed.\nWhile she slept, Athene, bright among goddesses, gave her\nambrosial gifts, to make her seem wondrous to the Achaians.\nTo begin with she cleansed her fine features with ambrosial\nbeauty, a salve such as that which fair-garlanded Kythereia\nemploys when she goes to join the Graces’ delightful dance;\nand she rendered her taller and fuller in appearance,\nand of whiter complexion than freshly sawn ivory. When\nshe’d done all this, she, the bright goddess, went on her way,\nand the white-armed handmaids then approached from the hall,\nchatting loudly, so that sweet sleep let Penelope go,\nand she sat up, rubbing her cheeks, and said to herself:\n“In the depth of my misery soft oblivion stilled my senses!\nHow I wish that chaste Artemis would give me so soft a death\nhere and now, that I might no longer with heartfelt lamentation\nwaste my life away, ever yearning for the unrivaled virtues\nof my dear husband, a man without peer among the Achaians.”\nSo saying, she went down from her bright upper chamber—\nnot alone, for the two handmaids followed in attendance.\nWhen she, bright among women, came where the suitors were,\nshe stood by the central post of the snugly timbered roof,\nholding up her shining veil in front of her face\nand flanked on either side by a devoted handmaid.\nAt once the men’s knees were weakened, their hearts inflamed\nby passion: each one of them prayed he might share her bed.\nBut she now addressed Telemachos, her dear son, saying:\n“Your mind-set and thinking, Telemachos, have got unbalanced!\nWhen you were still a child, you had more common sense!\nBut now you’re grown, and are on the verge of manhood—\nand outsiders, seeing only your stature and good looks,\nwould certainly think you the offspring of a successful man—\nyour mind and thinking no longer are on the proper track!\nLook at this business that just took place in our hall,\nthe way you let this stranger be so badly mistreated!\nAnd what if this same stranger, while sitting here in our house,\nwere to suffer real hurt from such grievous brutality? You\nwould then bear the burden of public shame and disgrace!”\nSagacious Telemachos now responded to her, saying:\n“My mother, I cannot reprove you for becoming angry:\nI myself now see and recognize all these things in my heart,\nboth the good and the worse, though before I thought as a child.\nYet I can’t work out everything with sagacity, because\nthey drive me crazy, these men sitting all around me\ncogitating their wicked schemes, while I have none to aid me.\nStill, the contest between the stranger and Iros didn’t go\nas the suitors expected: the stranger turned out a better fighter.\nHow I wish—by Zeus the Father, by Athene and Apollo!—\nthat these suitors were likewise now beaten, here in our home,\nheads lolling, some of them out there in the courtyard,\nothers inside the house, and the knees of all were unstrung,\nas now that lout Iros sits at the entrance to the courtyard,\nhead lolling, his appearance much like that of a drunk,\nunable to stand on his feet or to make his way home\nto wherever he lives, since his limbs are quite unstrung.”\nSuch was their conversation, the one with the other;\nand Eurymachos now addressed himself to Penelope, saying:\n“Ikarios’ daughter, most prudent Penelope: could all\nthe Achaians throughout Iasian Argos see you now,\nstill more suitors would be feasting here in your halls\nfrom early tomorrow, since you excel all other women\nin beauty and stature—and indeed in your sensible mind.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Eurymachos, any excellence of beauty and figure I had\nthe immortals destroyed at the time the Argives embarked\nfor Ilion, and among them went my husband, Odysseus.\nWere he only to come back now, and give comfort to my life,\ngreater would be my renown, and finer too; but now\nI grieve, so many sorrows has some god laid upon me.\nIndeed, when he was leaving his native land, did he not\nclasp my right hand at the wrist, and then address me, saying:\n‘My wife, since I don’t imagine that the well-greaved Achaians\nwill all return safe and unscathed from the land of Troy—\nfor the Trojans, they say, are most redoubtable warriors,\nas both spearmen and archers, and also as skillful charioteers\ndriving swift-footed horses, such men as can most quickly\ndecide who’ll win the great contest of leveling warfare—\nI don’t know whether the god will bring me back, or if\nI’ll die out at Troy: the care of all here must rest with you.\nLook after my mother and father at home as you do now,\nor with even closer attention, while I’m far away;\nbut if the day comes when you see our son grown and bearded,\nthen wed the man of your choice, and leave this house.’\n“So he spoke,\nand now all this is being brought about. A night\nwill come when some hateful marriage will be the lot\nof my unblest self, whom Zeus has deprived of comfort.\nBut in this matter sore grief has come on my heart and spirit,\nfor this was never the way that suitors wooed in the past,\nwhen men wanting to court a fine lady and rich man’s daughter\nwould all be in competition with one another, themselves\nbringing along fat flocks and cows to provide a banquet\nfor the bride’s friends and family, and giving her splendid gifts—\nnot devouring the substance of others, with no payment.”\nSo she spoke, and noble much-enduring Odysseus rejoiced\nbecause she coaxed gifts from these men, and charmed their hearts\nwith sweet words, while her mind was set on quite different things.\nThen Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, once more addressed her, saying:\n“Ikarios’ daughter, most prudent Penelope, presents—such as\nany one of the Achaians might bring for you here—you should\naccept, for it’s never polite to refuse a gift! But we\nshall depart neither back to our holdings nor anywhere else\nuntil you marry the man who’s the best of the Achaians.”\nSo Antinoos spoke. What he said was to their liking,\nand each man sent off a herald to fetch his presents.\nA large and exquisite robe was what came for Antinoos,\nfinely embroidered: attached to it were a dozen brooches,\nall of gold, and each fitted with smoothly rounded clasps.\nThere soon arrived for Eurymachos an elaborate golden\nchain, strung with amber beads, as bright as sunlight.\nEurydamas’ servants brought him a pair of earrings, with triple\nclustering pendants: much grace shone from them.\nFrom the house of the lord Peisandros, Polyktor’s son,\nhis servant now brought a necklace, an exquisite ornament.\nThus every Achaian provided some kind of lovely gift.\nBut she, bright among women, went back to her upper room,\nwhile her handmaids accepted these beautiful presents for her.\nThe men now turned their attention to the dance and delightful song\nfor their pleasure, awaiting the arrival of evening; and while\nthey were still enjoying themselves, dark evening came on.\nThen at once they set up three braziers in the hall\nto give them light, and piled seasoned firewood round them,\ndried out long since and sapless, newly split with the bronze,\nand set torches between them. The maids of steadfast-minded\nOdysseus took turns lighting them, and he himself, Zeus-born\nresourceful Odysseus, now spoke among them, saying:\n“You maidservants of Odysseus, your long-absent lord,\ngo back now up to the chamber where your revered queen is,\nply your distaffs beside her—and keep her cheerful while\nyou’re sitting there in her room—or card the wool\nwith your hands: I myself will make light for all these men,\nand even if they’re determined to stay up till well-throned Dawn\nthey won’t exhaust me, oh no: I’m a much-enduring fellow.”\nSo he spoke. But the handmaids tittered, and glanced at each other,\nand fair-cheeked Melantho reproved him in shameful wise—\nshe whom Dolios sired, but Penelope raised and cherished\nlike a daughter, and gave her all the toys she wanted.\nYet not even so did she share any part of Penelope’s sorrow,\nbut was having sex with Eurymachos, was his regular lover.\nShe now upbraided Odysseus in censorious language, saying:\n“You miserable stranger, you must be clean out of your mind!\nYou’re not willing to go get your sleep in a smithy, or some\npublic doss-house: oh no, you’re busy speaking so boldly,\namong all these gentlemen! Have you no proper respect?\nWine’s surely fuddled your wits, or else your mind’s\nalways like this, you’re forever spouting nonsense!\nAre you above yourself after beating that vagrant Iros?\nAnother man, better than Iros, may soon stand up against you,\nbeat you about the head with his powerful fists, befoul you\nwith streams of your own blood, and chase you from this house.”\nWith an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus retorted, saying:\n“You bitch, I’ll go straight to Telemachos, tell him the way\nyou talk! Very likely he’ll cut you up, there and then!”\nSo he spoke. His words sent the women scurrying off:\nAway they went through the hall, the limbs of each one loosened\nbeneath her by fear: they thought he’d do what he said.\nBut Odysseus stood by the flaming braziers, fed them,\none eye on the crowd of suitors, while in his mind he pondered\nother matters, not destined to go without fulfillment.\nBut these haughty suitors Athene would not permit at all\nto back off from distressing outrage: she wanted its pain to sink\ndeeper still into the heart of Laertes’ son Odysseus.\nNow Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, began to address them,\nmaking fun of Odysseus, arousing laughter in his comrades:\n“Listen to me, all you suitors of our glorious queen, while I\nsay what the heart in my breast impels me to tell you!\nNot without the gods’ will has this man reached Odysseus’ home!\nThe torchlight does indeed appear to emanate from him—\nfrom his head, that is, which lacks the least trace of hair upon it.”\nWith that he addressed Odysseus, the city-sacker, saying:\n“Would you come and work for me, stranger, as a hired day-laborer,\non my outlying estate—your pay would be adequate—\ncollecting stones for the field walls, and planting tall trees?\nI’d provide you there with food the entire year through,\nand keep you well clothed, and give you shoes for your feet.\nBut since all you’ve learnt are bad habits, you won’t want\nto set yourself to hard work; no, you’d rather beg your way\nthrough the district, to keep your insatiate belly fed.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Eurymachos, how I wish we two might have a contest\nin the season of spring, when the days are growing longer,\nout in the meadow, and I had a well-curved scythe in my hands,\nand you another one like it, for us to make trial of our work,\ngoing without food until evening, and the grass was thick!\nOr again, I wish we had teams of oxen to drive—the best,\nbig and tawny, both well fed on grass, both of an age,\nboth equal in drawing power, and of no slight strength—\nin a four-acre field, the clods yielding to the plowshare:\nthen you’d see whether I could keep my furrows straight!\nOr again, if the son of Kronos from somewhere brought an attack\nupon us today, and I had a shield and two spears\nand a helmet made all of bronze, snug against my temples,\nthen you’d see me out there among the foremost fighters,\nand wouldn’t abuse me in speeches because of my belly!\nBut you’re so incredibly arrogant and rigid-minded—\nI suppose you think you’re a great and powerful fellow\nbecause those you consort with are mean and common?\nIf only Odysseus might come, and return to his own country,\nthen at once these doors, however wide, would be\nall too narrow for your flight out through the entrance!”\nSo he spoke. Eurymachos flared up in wrath, stared at him\nwith an angry glance, then addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“You wretch, I’ll soon punish you for the way you have of speaking\nso boldly, among all these gentlemen! Have you no proper respect?\nWine’s surely fuddled your wits, or else your mind’s\nalways like this, you’re forever spouting nonsense!\nAre you above yourself after beating that vagrant Iros?”\nSo saying, he snatched up a footstool; but Odysseus\nducked down at Doulichian Amphinomos’ knees in reaction to\nEurymachos, whose throw instead hit the wine bearer’s\nright hand, so that his pitcher fell to the ground with a clang,\nwhile he himself groaned, collapsed backward in the dust.\nThe suitors now burst into uproar throughout the shadowy halls,\nand thus would one of them speak, with a glance at his neighbor:\n“I wish this stranger had died somewhere else in his wanderings\nbefore he came here! Then he’d never have raised such a tumult!\nBut now we’re at odds over beggars, there’ll be no pleasure\nin our privileged feasting, since meaner ways prevail.”\nTelemachos, princely in power, also addressed them, saying:\n“Foolish sirs, you are crazy! You no longer hide the effects\nof your swilling and guzzling—some god must be stirring you up!\nYou’ve feasted well: go home now, lie down and rest—of course\nwhen the mood takes you: I chase no person away!”\nSo he spoke. Every one of them bit his lip and marveled\nat Telemachos because of his bold outspoken manner.\nBut Amphinomos, illustrious son of Nisos, the lord\nAretias’ son, now addressed them, saying: “Friends,\nin response to what has been fairly and justly spoken\nno man should take offense, make a hostile retort!\nDo not abuse this stranger, or any one of the servants\nnow domiciled in the household of godlike Odysseus!\nNo, rather let’s have the wine bearer pour drops in our cups\nso we can make libations, and then go home to rest,\nleaving the stranger behind here in the halls of Odysseus\nfor Telemachos to look after: it’s to his house that he’s come.”\nSo he spoke: what he said was acceptable to them all.\nThen a bowl was mixed up for them by the hero Moulios\nfrom Doulichion, a herald and the squire of Amphinomos.\nHe gave it to all in due order: they made libations\nto the blessed gods, and drank the honey-sweet wine.\nThen, libations made, when they’d drunk all they’d a mind to,\nthey all departed to rest, each man to his own home.\n",

         "\nSo noble Odysseus was left behind, there in the hall,\nwith Athene’s aid contriving a plan to kill the suitors;\nand now he addressed Telemachos with winged words, saying:\n“Telemachos, we must lay up all our weapons of war inside\nand disarm the suitors with soothing words when they note\ntheir absence and ask you questions about them. Say:\n‘I stored them away from the smoke, since they no longer look\nas they did when Odysseus left them on going off to Troy,\nbut are blackened with all the fire’s breath that’s got to them.\nAnd there’s a greater concern some god has put in my mind:\nthat when you’re flushed with wine you may pick a quarrel\namong you and wound one another and so disgrace\nyour feast and your wooing: for iron of itself attracts a man.’”\nSo he spoke. Telemachos obeyed his own dear father,\nand summoned his nurse Eurykleia, and addressed her, saying:\n“Good mother, please keep the women confined to their quarters\nwhile I put away in the storeroom the weapons of my father—\nfine gear, left in the house uncared for, blackened with smoke\never since my father’s departure, when I was still a child.\nBut now I want to store them out of reach of the fire’s breath.”\nHis dear nurse Eurykleia responded to him, saying:\n“Indeed, child, I could wish you were always so concerned\nto take care of the house and to guard the possessions in it!\nBut who, pray, will go get a light and carry it for you?\nThe maidservants would have done it, but you won’t let them.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“This stranger here; for I’ll permit no man to be idle\nwho gets my rations, however remote the place he’s from.”\nSo he spoke; but her answer remained unwinged,\nand she barred the doors of the pleasantly sited halls.\nOdysseus and his illustrious son now both set to work\ncarrying in the helmets and the embossed shields,\nthe sharp-pointed spears; and before them Pallas Athene\nwent holding a golden lamp that made resplendent light.\nAt once Telemachos spoke, and addressed his father, saying:\n“Father, here’s a great wonder that my eyes behold!\nReally, the walls of the hall and its elegant panels,\nthe roof beams of fir and the tall posts holding them up\nare glowing bright to my eyes, like a blazing fire!\nSurely some god’s in here, one of those who hold wide heaven.”\nResourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Hush! Keep this to yourself, and ask no questions!\nThis is indeed the way of the gods who hold Olympos.\nYou go get your rest now: I shall stay here and provoke\nmore interest yet in the handmaids and your mother—\nshe’ll weep, and question me about every detail.”\nSo he spoke, and Telemachos now went out through the hall,\nlit by the flaring torches, to bed down in his room,\nwhere he always retired when sweet sleep came upon him.\nNow once more he lay down there, to await the bright Dawn,\nwhile noble Odysseus was left behind, there in the hall,\nwith Athene’s aid contriving a plan to kill the suitors.\nNow prudent Penelope came down from her chamber,\nin appearance like Artemis or golden Aphrodite,\nand for her they set a chair by the fire, where she always sat,\ninlaid with spirals of silver and ivory: this was the work\nof the craftsman Ikmalios, who’d fashioned a stool for the feet\nthat was part of the chair itself. A great fleece was spread on it.\nOn this, then, prudent Penelope sat, while her white-armed\nhandmaids came in from the women’s hall, and began\nto remove all the leftover food, as well as the tables,\nand the cups from which these haughty men had been drinking;\nthey threw out the ash from the braziers, heaped them up\nwith fresh firewood, to provide both light and warmth. And now\nMelantho began once again to scold Odysseus, saying:\n“Stranger, are you still here? Are you going to annoy us\nall night, prowling round the house, spying on the women?\nGet out of here, you wretch, be content with your supper,\nor you’ll soon be thrown out, and beaten with firebrands too!”\nWith an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded:\n“Woman, why reprimand me in so resentful a spirit?\nIs it because I’m dirty and wear mean clothes and go\nbegging my way through the neighborhood? It’s need compels me.\nThat’s the way it is with beggars and vagabonds!\nYet I too once dwelt in my own rich house among other\nprosperous men, and I often would give to a vagrant,\nno matter what sort he was or what he arrived in need of!\nCountless servants I had, and much else in abundance,\nowning which men live well and are known as wealthy.\nBut Kronos’ son Zeus wrecked it all—on some whim, I guess.\nSo take good care, woman, lest one day you lose all\nthat beauty for which you stand out among the handmaids,\nlest your mistress may come to dislike you, and treat you harshly,\nor Odysseus may return—there’s still hope! But even if\nhe’s actually dead, and will nevermore come back home,\nyet already, thanks to Apollo, his son’s such a man as himself—\nTelemachos! He doesn’t miss it if one of the serving women\nin the hall misbehaves—he’s no longer the child he was.”\nSo he spoke, and prudent Penelope heard what he said,\nand rebuked the maidservant, addressed her directly, saying:\n“Bold woman, impudent bitch, none of your gross misconduct\nhas escaped me—on your own head you’ll wipe it off!\nWell did you know, since it was from me you heard it,\nthat I wanted to question the stranger here in my halls\nabout my husband, for whom my grief is great and ceaseless.”\nWith that she also addressed the housekeeper Eurynome, saying:\n‘‘Eurynome, bring a chair here, and spread a fleece upon it,\nso the stranger may sit down now and tell me his story\nand also listen to me: I’m eager to question him.”\nSo he spoke, and Eurynome at once went off and fetched\na polished chair, and threw a fleece over it. Then\nmuch-enduring noble Odysseus seated himself, and prudent\nPenelope was the first to start their discussion, saying:\n“Stranger, I shall begin by asking you this question:\nWho are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?”\nTo her then resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n“Lady, no mortal on this boundless earth could ever\nfind fault with you: your fame goes up to the wide heaven,\nlike that of some king, a blameless, god-fearing person\nwho reigns over many valiant men, and upholds\njustice: one for whom the black soil bears in abundance\nboth wheat and barley, the trees are heavy with fruit,\nthe flocks bring forth young in season, the sea yields fish,\nall from his good leadership, and his people thrive under him.\nSo question me here in your house about anything else,\nbut don’t ask me about my background or my native country,\nlest you fill my heart with yet more suffering as I\nrecall them; for I’m a man of deep grief. What’s more,\nit’s not right that I should sit in someone else’s house\nweeping and wailing: such uncurbed sorrow’s a bad thing.\nI don’t want one of your handmaids, much less you yourself,\nsaying I swim in tears since my mind’s deep-sodden with wine.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Stranger, any excellence of beauty and figure I had\nthe immortals destroyed at the time the Argives embarked\nfor Ilion, and among them went my husband, Odysseus.\nWere he only to come back now, and give comfort to my life,\ngreater would be my renown, and finer too; but now\nI grieve, so many sorrows has some god laid upon me.\nAll the highborn leaders who lord it over the islands—\nDoulichion and Same and forested Zakynthos,\nbesides those who rule as princes in rugged Ithake—\nall court me against my will, and squander my property.\nAnd so I pay no attention to strangers and suppliants,\nor to heralds at all, who indeed are public officials,\nbut waste my own heart away in yearning for Odysseus.\nSo these men urge my remarriage, while I spin my deceits.\nFirst, some god put in my mind the idea of a great web\nin my halls: so I set up a big loom, and started weaving—\nbroad was the web, fine of thread—then addressed them, saying:\n‘You young men, my suitors now noble Odysseus is dead,\nbe patient, though eager to wed me, until I finish\nthis web: I should not want my woven work to be wasted—\na shroud for the hero Laertes, against that day\nwhen the grim fate of pitiless death shall overtake him:\nthen the local Achaian women won’t be able to blame me\nfor a man who’d won so much being left with no winding-sheet.’\n“So I spoke; and the manly spirit was persuaded within them.\nFrom then on, day after day, I’d weave at the great loom,\nbut at night I’d have torches set up, and undo my work.\n“Thus for three years I convinced, and deceived, the Achaians;\nbut when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round,\nand the months wore away, and day after day passed by,\nthen it was that, told by my handmaids, the uncaring bitches,\nthey stole up on me and caught me, reproached me loudly.\nSo against my will I was made to finish the job, perforce;\nand now I can neither avoid this marriage, nor find\nany other way of escape. My parents keep urging me\nto get wed, my son frets as these men consume our estate—\nsomething he understands, for now he’s a man, well able\nto look after a household to which Zeus still grants honor!\nYet even so tell me your family, where you come from—\nyou’re not sprung from the oak of legend, nor from a rock!”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,\nwill you never quit questioning me about my background?\nI’ll tell you, then; though you’ll give me over to yet more\ngriefs than I have already—but that’s the way of it,\nwhen a man’s been absent from home as long as I have,\na vagrant who’s suffered much on the road from city to city.\nNevertheless I’ll answer your questions and enquiries!\nThere’s a country called Krete out in the wine-dark deep,\nfine, rich-soiled, and sea-girt; it has in it many people,\nso many they’re countless: they have ninety cities,\nand various tongues, one mixed with another—Achaians,\nproud native Kretans, Kydonians, all are established there,\nwith Dorians in three settlements, and noble Pelasgians too!\nAmong their townships is Knosos, a great city, in which Minos\nruled from the age of nine, held converse with great Zeus,\nand was father to my father, great-hearted Deukalion.\nDeukalion sired both me and the lordly Idomeneus,\nwho’d set out for Ilion in his curved ships along with\nthe sons of Atreus. My own famous name is Aithon;\nI was the younger by birth, he my elder and better.\nIt was there I met Odysseus, gave him a guest-friend’s gifts,\nfor a gale-force wind had brought him too to Krete\nas he made for Troy, driving him off course past Malea.\nSo he put in to Amnisos, site of the cave of Eileithyia,\nin a difficult harbor, having barely escaped the storm.\nHe went up to the city at once, and asked for Idomeneus,\nclaiming to be his dear and respected guest-friend; but\nit was ten or eleven days since Idomeneus had gone,\nsailing away with his curved ships to Ilion. So I\nescorted him to our house, and welcomed him properly,\nwith full entertainment from our rich household store;\nand for the rest of the comrades who were with him I obtained\nfrom public reserves both barley and bright red wine,\nand sacrificial cattle, to keep them well satisfied.\nThere for twelve days the noble Achaians were delayed\nby a north wind so powerful it wouldn’t even let them stand\nupright: I suppose some maleficent deity roused it.\nBut on the thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they put to sea.”\nThus he told many lies, but made them seem like the truth,\nand her tears flowed as she listened, her stubborn heart melted.\nAs snow will melt on a high mountain’s ramparts, where\nthe east wind thaws the snow that a west wind has sent down,\nand, melting, it brims the fast-flowing rivers—just so\nher fine cheeks streamed with the tears she shed as she wept\nfor the husband sitting beside her. But though Odysseus\npitied his sobbing wife in his heart, yet nevertheless\nhis eyes—as though made of horn or iron—remained\nunwavering under their lids. Deceptively he concealed\nhis own tears. When she’d had her fill of tearful lamentation,\nonce more she responded to him, saying: “Now I think\nI need to make trial of you, stranger, and discover\nwhether you and your godlike comrades did in fact\nentertain my husband at home, the way you claim!\nTell me, what clothes was he wearing, what kind of person\nwas he himself, which companions did he have with him?”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n“Lady, it’s hard for one who’s been so long abroad\nto say for sure: it’s now the twentieth year since he\ndeparted thence, leaving my native country! However,\nI’ll tell you how my memory pictures him today:\nnoble Odysseus had on a woolen cloak, purple in color,\nand double-folded, its fibula fashioned of gold,\nwith twin pin-sheaths. On its front was delicately incised\na hound with a dappled fawn gripped in its forepaws,\nwatching it writhe: and everyone thought it marvelous\nhow the dog, though of gold, eyed the fawn it was throttling,\nwhile the fawn’s feet were struggling in its efforts to escape.\nI noted the tunic he wore, too—it shone all over,\nlike the sheen you see on the skin of a dried onion,\nso soft and sheer it was, and as bright as sunlight,\nand many indeed were the women who marveled at it.\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nI don’t know whether Odysseus wore such clothes at home,\nor if some comrade gave him them on boarding that swift ship,\nor a stranger perhaps, since to many Odysseus was\na good friend, and few Achaians could be called his equal.\nI gave him a bronze sword myself and a double-folded\ncloak—a fine purple one—and a tunic with a fringe,\nand saw him off properly in his well-benched vessel.\nAnd there was a herald with him, a slightly older man—\nLet me describe him to you, as I recall he looked—\nround-shouldered, dark of complexion, with curly hair,\nand his name was Eurybates. Odysseus respected him more\nthan his other companions: they were a like-minded pair.”\nSo he spoke, and stirred in her heart yet more the urge to weep,\nsince she recognized the sure signs that Odysseus had told her.\nBut when she had had her fill of tearful lamentation,\nshe then responded to him, saying: “Hitherto, stranger,\nyou’ve earned our pity; but from this time on in my halls\nyou’ll receive the treatment that’s kept for an honored friend!\nI myself gave him those clothes, just as you describe them,\nfrom the storeroom, folded them, attached that bright brooch\nas an ornament for him! But himself I’ll never welcome\nreturning back home to his own beloved country:\nan ill-fated day it was, then, when Odysseus set out\nin his hollow ship to ill Ilion—that unspeakable name!”\nTo her then resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,\nno longer mar your fair flesh, nor waste away your heart\nin mourning your husband—though I cannot blame you:\nfor any woman will weep when she’s lost her wedded\nhusband, to whom she’s borne children, conceived in love,\nthough he’ll not be an Odysseus, who they say was like\nthe gods. Now stop your crying, and attend to my words,\nfor I’m going to tell you the truth, and hold back nothing.\nI recently heard news concerning Odysseus’ return—\nthat he’s near, in the rich country of the Thesprotians,\nstill alive, and bringing with him much splendid treasure,\ncollecting it through the region. But his trusty companions\nhe lost, with his hollow ship, on the wine-dark deep\non his way from the isle of Thrinakie, for Zeus and Helios\nmade him suffer because his comrades had slaughtered Helios’ cattle.\nSo they all perished in the surging deep; but him,\nastride his ship’s keel, the waves then cast ashore\nin the country of the Phaiakians, who are kin to the gods.\nThese treated him like a god, paid him heartfelt honors,\ngave him many gifts, and were themselves quite willing\nto escort him home unscathed. Odysseus would have been\nback here long since, had he not thought it more gainful\nto amass a great deal of wealth by wide world travel:\nfor Odysseus excels all mortals in his knowledge of ways\nto profit, a field in which no other man could match him.\nKing Pheidon of the Thesprotians told me as much. Moreover\nhe told me on oath, while pouring libations at home,\nthat the ship had been launched, and the crew were in readiness\nto convey him to his own country. But me he sent off first,\nsince there chanced to be a Thesprotian vessel ready\nto sail for Doulichion, that country rich in wheat.\nAnd he showed me all the possessions Odysseus had amassed—\nenough to support his descendants to the tenth generation\nwere the treasures stored for him there in the king’s domain!\nBut Odysseus, he said, had gone to Dodone, to discover\nfrom the deep-leaved sacred oak what Zeus was planning\nand how he should make his way back to Ithake’s rich land\nafter so long an absence, whether openly or in secret.\nThus, as I say, he is safe, he’ll be here at any moment:\nhe’s very near now, not much longer will he be absent\nfrom his friends and his country! I’ll give you my sworn word:\nZeus first, highest and best of gods, be my witness,\nand the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\nthat all these things indeed will come to pass as I tell you!\nWithin the current moon’s sequence Odysseus will arrive here,\nbetween this month’s waning and the rising of the next.”\nPrudent Penelope then responded to him, saying:\n“Would that these words of yours, stranger, might be fulfilled!\nThen you’d soon know both friendship and gifts in plenty\nfrom me—any man who met you would call you blessed!\nBut this is how, in my heart, I think it will be: Odysseus\nwill nevermore come home, nor will you obtain\nconveyance—there are no longer such masters in this house\nas Odysseus was among men—if he ever existed—\nto welcome respected strangers or escort them on their way.\nNevertheless, my handmaids, bathe him, make his bed\nwith bedding and coverlets and bright-colored blankets, so he’s\nwarm until he comes through to Dawn the golden-throned.\nThen early tomorrow bathe him and rub him with oil,\nso that in here beside Telemachos he may sharpen his appetite\nas he sits in the hall. It will be the worse for any of these\nmen who rudely annoys him: such a man will have no future\nhere from now on, no matter how angrily he reacts!\nFor how will you learn about me, stranger, whether I\nreally excel other women in mind and prudent counsel\nif you sit down to a meal in my hall unwashed\nand in threadbare clothes? Men’s span of life is brief.\nWhoever is harsh himself, whose mind knows harshness,\non him all mortals invoke disaster for the future\nwhile he lives, and the whole world mocks him once he’s dead.\nBut whoever is blameless himself, and has blameless thoughts,\nstrangers will spread his renown both far and wide\namong all mankind, and many will praise his nobility.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,\ncoverlets and bright-colored blankets have been hateful\nto me ever since I left Krete’s snow-clad mountains\nbehind me, and sailed away in my long-oared ship.\nI shall bed down as I’ve done on other sleepless nights:\nmany the nights I’ve spent on some wretched resting place,\nlying there waiting for the brightly enthroned Dawn!\nNor does the washing of feet bring solace of any kind\nto my heart: there isn’t a woman that shall touch my feet\nof all the servants you have here in this house—unless\nthere’s maybe some aged woman, with a devoted heart,\nwho’s suffered as much in her spirit as I have myself:\nI wouldn’t have any objection to her handling my feet.”\nOnce more prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Dear guest, never yet, of the strangers from distant places,\nhas a man so sagacious been more welcome in my home—\nso well-phrased and responsible is everything you say!\nI do have one such old woman, very sensible-minded,\nwho nursed and cared for that unfortunate man,\ncradled him in her arms the day his mother bore him.\nIt’s she who shall wash your feet, enfeebled though she is.\nCome on, up with you now, my prudent Eurykleia,\nand wash one of an age with your master: Odysseus, I’m sure,\nmust by now have just such feet and just such hands,\nfor too soon does the stress of ill-fortune age us mortals.”\nSo she spoke: the old woman hid her face in her hands,\nshed hot tears, then uttered words of lamentation, saying:\n“Alas, child, for you I am helpless. Zeus must have hated you—\ndevout heart though you had—beyond all other men.\nNever yet to Zeus, hurler of thunderbolts, did a mortal\nburn so many fat thighs, such splendid arrays of oxen\nas you offered up, with prayers that you might achieve\na sleek old age and rear your illustrious son. But now\nyou alone he’s wholly deprived of a day of homecoming!\nHe too, I imagine, was jeered at by the women\nof far-distant strangers, when he came to some house of renown,\njust as these bitches here all together are making fun of you,\nand it’s to avoid their mistreatment and endless insults\nthat you won’t let them wash you; so it’s me, nothing loath, to whom\nIkarios’ prudent daughter Penelope’s given the job.\nSo I’ll wash your feet, for both Penelope’s sake and yours,\nsince the heart in my breast is stirred by sorrow. But now\ntake good note of what I’m about to say to you:\nMany a travel-worn stranger’s made his way here, but none,\nI tell you, have I yet seen who bore so close a resemblance\nas you do—voice, build, and gait—to Odysseus himself.”\nTo her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n“Old dame, that’s what everyone says who’s seen us both:\nthat we resemble each other closely—a likeness\nthat you too now have noticed, and remarked on.”\nSo he spoke.\nThe old woman took the bright cauldron, and prepared\nto wash him. She first poured out a lot of cold water,\nthen added some hot. But Odysseus sat down by the hearth,\nand at once turned away toward the darker side, because\nhe’d suddenly realized that when she was handling him\nshe would notice the scar, and the truth would be revealed.\nAnd indeed, as she settled in close to wash her lord, she did\nat once know the scar, of a wound that a boar’s white tusk\nhad made when he went to Parnassos, to Autolykos and his sons—\nhis mother’s noble father, who outstripped all mankind\nin thieving and artful oaths, a talent bestowed by a god—\nHermes, to whom he burned acceptable thigh pieces\nof lambs and kids, and so was quite ready to protect him.\nNow Autolykos paid a visit to the rich land of Ithake,\nwhere he found the son of his daughter, recently born,\nand Eurykleia placed the baby on his knees at the moment he\nwas finishing supper, then spoke, and addressed him, saying:\n“Autolykos, up to you now to find a name to bestow on\nyour own child’s dear child: he has been much prayed for.” To her\nAutolykos then responded, saying: “My daughter’s husband,\nand you, my daughter, give him the name I shall tell you.\nSince I come here as one who’s dealt pain and grief to many,\nmen and women alike, over the fruitful earth,\nlet his name be Odysseus; and I, for my part, when he\ncomes as a grown man to the great house on Parnassos\nof his mother’s family, where I keep my possessions,\nwill give him his share, and send him back rejoicing.”\nThis was what Odysseus had come for, to get his splendid gifts.\nAutolykos greeted him, and the sons of Autolykos too,\nwith handshakes and expressions of cordial welcome,\nand his mother’s mother, Amphithee, embraced Odysseus,\nand kissed his head and both of his beautiful eyes,\nand Autolykos gave the word to his illustrious sons\nto get dinner ready, and they responded to his call.\nAt once they brought in a male ox, five years old,\nflayed it, dressed it, butchered the whole carcass,\nexpertly cut up the pieces and threaded them on spits,\nroasted these carefully and then shared out the portions.\nSo all day long until the hour when the sun went down\nthey feasted, and no one lacked his fair share of the meal.\nBut after the hour of sunset, when darkness came on,\nthen they retired to rest, and embraced the gift of sleep.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthey sallied forth on the hunt, both the dogs and the sons\nof Autolykos: and along with them noble Odysseus\nwent too. Up the steep slopes of the forest-clad mountain\nParnassos they climbed, and soon reached its windy ravines.\nThe sun was just striking the fields below on its way\nup from the peaceful and deep-flowing stream of Ocean\nwhen the hunters came to a forest glen. Ahead of them went\nthe dogs, pursuing a scent, and close behind them\nAutolykos’ sons, among them noble Odysseus, hard on\nthe heels of the dogs, and brandishing his far-shadowing spear.\nThere, in a dense thicket, was crouched a huge wild boar.\nThe damp force of driving winds could not penetrate its lair,\nnor the sun with its gleaming rays shine into it, nor the rain\npierce right through its protection, so thick it was; and the drifts\nof fallen leaves had piled up in their abundance round it.\nNow the boar heard the sound of footfalls, from men and dogs\npressing on in the hunt, and out from his lair he came\nto face them, back all abristle, fire glinting from his eyes,\nand stood close at bay. Then, first of them all, Odysseus\nsprang forward, long spear raised high in his stout hand,\nready to strike; but the boar beat him to it, gored him\nabove the knee, tore with his tusk a long gash in the flesh,\nattacking him slantwise, but failed to reach his leg-bone;\nand Odysseus struck him squarely in the right shoulder,\nso that the bright spear’s point now drove clean through.\nThe boar gasped, and fell in the dust, and the life fled from him.\nAutolykos’ sons then busied themselves with the carcass,\nand the wound that blameless godlike Odysseus had suffered\nthey skillfully bandaged, and stanched the flow of dark blood\nwith a charm, then went straight back to their father’s house.\nSo Autolykos, and the sons of Autolykos, healed him\nfully and well, handed over his splendid gifts, and then\nsoon sent him back rejoicing to his native country,\nto Ithake; and there his father and lady mother\nwelcomed him home with pleasure, asked detailed questions\nabout how he came to be wounded; he told them the way\nthe boar’s white tusk had gored him when he was out hunting\nup on Parnassos, together with the sons of Autolykos.\nThis scar the old woman recognized when she felt it\nin the palms of her hands, and she dropped his leg. It fell\nshin first into the basin, with a clatter of bronze:\nthe basin tipped over, the water spilled out on the floor,\nas joy and grief together invaded her heart, her eyes\nfilled with tears, and her voice stuck in her throat.\nHer hand reached out to touch Odysseus’ chin, she gasped:\n“It’s you, Odysseus, dear child, and I didn’t know you\nuntil I’d handled the rest of my master’s person!”\nWith that she turned her glance in Penelope’s direction,\nwanting to show her that her dear husband was there,\nbut Athene distracted Penelope’s mind, so she could neither\nmeet her eye nor guess at her meaning. As for Odysseus,\nhe felt for Eurykleia’s throat with his right hand, seized it,\nwith the other drew her close to him, and whispered, saying:\n“Old nurse, are you trying to kill me? You yourself suckled me\nat your own breast! And now, after suffering much,\nI’ve come, in the twentieth year, back to my own country!\nBut since you’ve hit on the truth, and a god’s alerted you,\nhush now, don’t let anyone else in the house find out!\nFor if you do, this I tell you, and it shall come to pass:\nshould some god let me put down these lordly suitors,\nI shall not spare you, my nurse though you were, when I slay\nthose other serving women, here in my halls.”\nThen prudent\nEurykleia responded to him, saying: “My child,\nwhat’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth?\nYou know how firm my strength is, how unyielding—\nI shall keep your secret as close as hard stone or iron!\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nIf some god lets you put down these lordly suitors,\nthen I’ll report to you on the women in your halls,\nwhich ones dishonor you, and which remain innocent.”\nTo her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n“Old mother, why tell me of them? There’s no need! I myself\nshall take good note and discover the truth about each one.\nNo, just keep my secret, and leave the rest to the gods.”\nSo he spoke. The old woman went off through the hall to fetch\nfresh foot-washing water, for the first lot was all spilt;\nand when she’d washed him, and rubbed him well with oil,\nOdysseus once more drew his chair back nearer the fire\nto warm himself, and concealed the scar beneath his rags.\nThen prudent Penelope started their conversation, saying:\n“Stranger, there’s one small thing I still must ask you,\nsince soon it will be the time for pleasant repose—at least,\nfor him whom sweet sleep possesses despite his cares!\nBut to me some deity’s brought a sorrow that’s measureless:\nby day I find my pleasure in mourning and lamentation,\nwhile I look to my household tasks, and those of my women;\nbut when night comes, and sleep catches everybody else,\nI lie on my bed, and around my throbbing heart\nsharp cares come crowding, to disquiet me as I lament.\nJust as Pandareus’ daughter, the greenwood nightingale,\nat the fresh onset of spring sings sweetly, sitting\nperched amid the thick foliage of the trees, and with\nclose variant trills pours forth her rippling song, a dirge\nlamenting her dear son Itylos, the son of King Zethos,\nwhom once with the bronze she slew unwittingly—even so\nmy heart’s torn in two directions, this way and that:\nshould I stay here with my son, keep everything unchanged—\nproperty, serving women, this large and high-roofed house—\nrespecting the bed of my husband and public opinion?\nOr should I now wed whoever’s the best of the Achaians\ncourting me here in my halls, bringing me countless gifts?\nSo long as my son was thinking and behaving as a child,\nhe wouldn’t let me abandon my husband’s house to remarry;\nbut now he’s full-grown and has come to manhood’s stature\nhe even begs me to go back home, so concerned he’s become\nfor his patrimony, which these Achaians are eating up.\n“But come, hear this dream of mine, and interpret it for me:\nI had twenty geese round the house, they came up from the water\nand I fed them on wheat: the sight of them warmed my heart.\nBut down from the mountain swooped a great eagle, with curved beak,\nbroke all their necks and killed them. They lay scattered\nall over the hall, while the eagle soared up in the bright sky.\nI wept and wailed, although it was only a dream,\nand the fine-tressed Achaian women gathered around me\nas I grieved sadly because the eagle had killed my geese.\nBut then back it came, perched on a jutting rafter,\nand with the voice of a human caught me short, declaring:\n‘Take heart, you daughter of far-famed Ikarios: this\nis no dream, but a true vision, that will surely be fulfilled!\nThese geese are the suitors, and I, who before was a bird,\nthe eagle, have now at last come back as your husband,\nwho’ll unleash a grim fate on all the suitors.’\nSo he spoke.\nThen honey-sweet sleep released its hold upon me,\nand glancing around I saw the geese in my domain\npecking up grain by the trough, as they’d done previously.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“Madam, no way is it possible, by twisting its clear meaning,\nto interpret this dream any other way, since Odysseus himself\nhas shown you how he’ll fulfill it! The doom of all the suitors\nis clear! Not one of them will escape death and the fates!”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Stranger, dreams are hard to make sense of or interpret,\nand not all of them reach fulfillment for us mortals.\nFor there are two gateways set up for fleeting dreams,\nof which one is constructed from horn, the other from ivory.\nThose dreams that come through the gate of sawn ivory\nare deceptive, bringing words that remain unfulfilled;\nbut those that emerge from the gate of polished horn\npresage the truth for anyone who beholds them. But for me\nit was not, I think, from there that my own strange dream\ncame—welcome though that would have been to me and my son!\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nThe ill-starred day is approaching that’s to remove me\nfrom the house of Odysseus: for now I shall order a contest—\nthose axes that he used to set up here in his halls\nin a straight line, like ships’ props, twelve of them all told—\nhe’d stand at a distance, and shoot an arrow through them.\nSo now I shall order this contest for the suitors:\nwhoever, handling his bow, shall string it most easily\nand then shoot an arrow clear through all twelve axes,\nwith him I’d depart, leaving this house to which I came\nas a wedded wife—a fine home, and full of rich possessions!\nI think I shall always remember it, even in my dreams.”\nTo her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,\ndo not any longer delay this contest in your house,\nfor resourceful Odysseus will arrive here before that—\nbefore these fellows can get to handle the polished bow,\nor string it, or shoot an arrow clean through the iron.”\nThen\nto him prudent Penelope responded, saying: “If you\nwere only willing, stranger, to sit on here in my halls\nand amuse me, sleep would never be shed upon my eyelids!\nBut no way can people possibly go without sleep forever;\nand so to each one of us mortals on this grain-giving earth\nthe immortals have allotted a proper time for repose.\nSo I shall go on back to my upper chamber and lie\non my bed, though it’s become a place of mourning for me,\nalways made damp by my tears, since the day when Odysseus\nleft to set eyes on ill Ilion—that unspeakable name!\nThat’s where I shall lie; but you sleep here in the hall—\nspread your own bedding, or have them make you up a bed.”\nSo saying, she went off back to her bright upper chamber,\nnot alone, for her handmaids accompanied her. And after\nshe’d retired to her upper chamber with her handmaids, then\nshe wept for Odysseus, her dear husband, until\ngrey-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\n",

         "\nBut noble Odysseus bedded down for sleep in the forecourt.\nOn the ground he spread out an undressed oxhide, above it\nputting many fleeces from sheep the Achaians had sacrificed;\nand when he settled, Eurynome threw a cloak over him.\nSo Odysseus, brooding on evil for the suitors in his heart\nlay there, still wakeful. And then from their hall the women\nemerged—those who had taken to sleeping with the suitors—\nlaughing and chattering cheerfully one to another; and rage\nerupted now in his breast, and much he debated,\nemotion and reason competing for his decision, whether\nto get up and rush them now, deal death to each one of them,\nor leave them to couple one last and final time\nwith these arrogant suitors. And his inner heart was growling\nas a bitch standing over her helpless puppies will growl\nat some unfamiliar man, more than ready to fight him: so\nhis heart growled within him, enraged at their bad behavior.\nBut he beat his breast, and upbraided his heart, declaring:\n“Endure, my heart! Worse than this you once endured\nthat day when the Kyklops, unmatchable in his strength,\nwas eating my valiant comrades; but you held on, till my plan\nbrought you safe out of that cave where you thought you’d die.”\nSo he spoke, addressing the dear spirit in his breast.\nIn full obedience to him, his heart now endured\nwithout pause; but he himself kept tossing and turning.\nAs a man cooking a paunch chockful of fat and blood\non a fierce blazing fire will turn it to and fro,\ndetermined to get it cooked through as fast as he can,\nso Odysseus tossed this way and that, trying to work out\nhow he was going to lay hands on the shameless suitors,\none man against so many. Then Athene approached him,\ndown from the sky, in appearance like a woman,\nand stood above his head, and addressed him, saying:\n“Wakeful again, you most ill-fated of all mortals?\nThis is your own house, and in this house are your wife\nand son—such a son indeed as anybody might pray for!”\nTo her then resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n“Yes indeed, goddess, all you’ve said is right and proper.\nBut here is what the heart in my breast is debating:\nhow I’m going to lay hands on these shameless suitors,\nalone, while they’re always in a body when they’re here.\nWhat’s more, there’s this greater problem that I’m facing:\neven if—both Zeus and you willing—I do kill them,\nhow then would I make my escape? Please consider that!”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Stubborn man! There are many who’d trust a weaker comrade—\na mortal, without any knowledge of such wisdom as mine!\nBut I am a god, one who guards you through to the end\nin all your endeavors! And I’ll tell you this openly:\nif there were fifty troops of mortal men in ambush\nall round us, firmly determined to kill us, nevertheless\neven then you’d drive off with their cattle and fattened sheep!\nBut for now let sleep overtake you. To stay awake on watch\nall night is a bad thing too. Soon you’ll be free of troubles.”\nSo she spoke, and shed sleep on his eyelids, but herself,\nbright among goddesses, made her way back to Olympos.\nWhile sleep, the limb-loosener, still had hold of him,\nrelaxing the cares of his heart, his affectionate wife\nawoke and wept, sitting up there, still in her soft bed.\nBut when her spirit had had its fill of weeping, then she,\nbright among women, first prayed to Artemis, saying:\n“Artemis, lady goddess, daughter of Zeus, how I wish\nyou’d shoot a shaft into my breast and take away my life\nnow, at this instant, or a storm wind would snatch me up,\nwhirl me away along those dark murky pathways,\ncast me forth at the mouth of refluent Ocean, as once\nstorm winds carried away Pandareus’ daughters! The gods\nhad killed their parents, and they were left abandoned\nas orphans there in the halls, and were cared for by Aphrodite\nwith cheese and sweet honey and pleasant-tasting wine;\nand Here bestowed on them, above all other women,\nbeauty and wisdom, while chaste Artemis gave them stature,\nand Athene made them accomplished in elegant handiwork.\nBut while bright Aphrodite was making for high Olympos—\nto Zeus, with his joy in the thunderbolt, for well he knows all,\nboth the good fortune and the misfortunes of transient mortals—\nto ask for these girls the fulfillment of a healthy marriage,\nthe storm winds’ spirits meanwhile snatched them away\nand surrendered them to the mercy of the loathsome Furies.\nSo, I wish, might those powers whose homes are on Olympos\nannihilate me, or fair-tressed Artemis strike me—Odysseus\nwould be in my mind’s eye as I went under this hated earth,\nand I’d never pleasure the thoughts of any lesser husband!\nYet the burden’s endurable for anyone who weeps\nin the daytime, constantly moved by deep distress at heart,\nbut is mastered by sleep at night, for sleep brings forgetfulness\nof all things, both good and bad, once it’s shrouded the eyelids.\nYet on me some god laid the burden of evil dreams as well,\nfor this night there lay in my arms one exactly like him,\nas he was when he left with his troops, and so my spirit\nrejoiced, for I thought it no dream, but rather a waking vision.”\nSo she spoke, and straightway Dawn, the golden-throned, came up.\nThe sound of her voice, weeping, got through to noble Odysseus:\nhe tried to think, and it seemed to his half-asleep mind\nthat she’d recognized him and was standing there at his head.\nThen he picked up the cloak, and the fleeces that he’d slept on,\nput them down on a chair in the hall, and carried the oxhide\noutside, and left it. Hands raised, he then made his prayer to Zeus:\n“Zeus, Father, if willingly you gods have now brought me back\nover dry and wet to my country, after troubling me so much,\nlet one of those waking inside speak a word of omen for me,\nand out here a sign from Zeus be made manifest as well.”\nSo he spoke in prayer, and Zeus the Counselor heard him.\nAt once he delivered thunder from gleaming Olympos\non high out of the clouds, and noble Odysseus rejoiced.\nAnd a woman, a grinder of grain, sent forth a word of omen\nfrom the house nearby where the mills of the people’s shepherd\nwere set. At these twelve women all told were workers,\ngrinding barley and wheat, men’s marrow. By now the others\nwere all asleep, having ground their quota of wheat, and she\nwas the only one who’d not finished, for she was the weakest.\nShe stopped her quern now and uttered an omen for her lord:\n“Zeus, Father, lord over gods and men, how loudly\nyou thundered out of the starry sky, yet nowhere is there\nany trace of cloud: this must be a portent you’re granting someone!\nThen fulfill for poor me too the wish I shall now pronounce:\nMay this be the final and latest day on which these suitors\nenjoy their delectable feast in the halls of Odysseus, they\nwho’ve weakened my knees with so much agonizing labor\ngrinding their grain: may this dinner be their last!”\nSo she spoke: noble Odysseus rejoiced at the words of omen\nand the thunder of Zeus, as he planned revenge upon the guilty.\nThe other serving women in Odysseus’ splendid house\nwere up now. They rekindled unwearying fire on the hearth,\nand Telemachos rose from his bed, a godlike mortal,\nput on his clothes, slung a sharp sword from his shoulder,\nbound on a pair of fine sandals under his sleek feet,\npicked out a sturdy spear, tipped with keen bronze, and went\nand stood at the threshold, and then addressed Eurykleia, saying:\n“Dear nurse, have you honored the stranger in our house\nwith a bed and food, or does he lie as he is, uncared-for?\nClever my mother may be, but that’s her way: on impulse\nshe’ll do the honors for some person who’s entirely\nunimportant, yet dismiss his better with no respect.”\nTo him then prudent Eurykleia responded, saying: “Child,\nin this case you shouldn’t blame her, when she’s blameless.\nHe sat there drinking wine as long as he’d a mind to,\nbut for food he said he’d no more appetite: she asked him.\nThen later, when his thoughts turned to lying down and sleep,\nshe told her serving women to make up a bed for him;\nbut he—like some totally wretched and ill-fated person—\ndidn’t want to sleep in a bed or under blankets, but chose\nto doss down on an undressed oxhide and fleeces of sheep\nin the forecourt: we had to throw a cloak over him.”\nSo she spoke. Telemachos made his way out through the hall,\nspear in hand, two hunting dogs at his heels, and went\nto the place of assembly to join the well-greaved Achaians.\nNow Eurykleia, bright among women—daughter of Ops,\nPeisenor’s son—addressed the handmaids, saying: “To work!\nSome of you busy yourselves with sweeping the house out,\nsprinkling the floors, and dressing the well-made chairs\nwith their purple coverlets; others wipe off all the tables\nwith sponges, wash clean the mixing-bowls and the crafted\ntwo-handled drinking cups; others go fetch water\nfrom the spring—and move smartly, get it back here soon!\nFor the suitors won’t be long absent from the hall: they’ll return\ngood and early: this is a public feast day.”\nSo she spoke,\nand each one listened with care and did what she ordered:\ntwenty set off to the spring of dark water, while the rest\nwent knowledgeably about their various tasks in the house.\nThen in came the spirited menservants and began\nto split logs well and skillfully, while the women\nreturned from the spring; and after them came the swineherd\ndriving three hogs, the best ones of all that he had;\nthese he let out to graze in the lush enclosures,\nand himself put a friendly query to Odysseus, saying:\n“Stranger, do the Achaians show you more regard now?\nOr are they still insulting you here in the hall, as before?”\nTo him resourceful Odysseus responded, saying: “Eumaios,\nwould that the gods might exact requital for the outrage\nof these men, who in their arrogance behave so recklessly\nin another man’s house, and have no sense of shame.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nThen up to them came Melanthios, the goatherd, driving\nthose she-goats that were the finest of all in his flocks\nto make a meal for the suitors. Two herdsmen accompanied him.\nThe goats he tethered beneath the echoing colonnade,\nthen addressed Odysseus abusively, saying: “Stranger,\nwon’t you ever stop making yourself a nuisance in this house,\nbegging alms from the men here? Can’t you get out and stay out?\nI’m pretty sure that we two won’t part company until\nwe’ve sampled each other’s fists, since your begging isn’t done\nin the proper way. And besides, there are other Achaian feasts.”\nSo he spoke. Resourceful Odysseus made him no answer,\nbut shook his head in silence, mind brooding on trouble.\nThe third to arrive beside these was Philoitios, leader of men,\ndriving up for the suitors a barren heifer and she-goats\nbrought over by ferrymen, who also convey others,\ntravelers, whoever approaches them for passage.\nThe beasts he tethered with care in the echoing colonnade,\nand then went up to the swineherd, and addressed him, saying:\n“Who is this stranger, swineherd, who’s recently arrived\nhere in our house? From what men does he claim descent?\nWhere is his family? What is the country of his birth?\nIll-fated, yes, but he still has the mien of a lord, a king—\nthough the gods do afflict men who wander far and wide,\nspinning a wretched fate for them, princes though they be.”\nWith that he turned to Odysseus, hand outstretched in greeting,\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “Stranger, father,\nall hail to you! May prosperity be your lot hereafter,\nthough now you’re weighed down by plentiful misfortunes!\nZeus, Father, no other god’s more lethal than you are:\nonce you’ve created men, you show them no pity for\nthe hardship and miserable suffering they must endure!\nI broke sweat at the sight of you, my eyes are full of tears\nas I remember Odysseus, for I fancy he too must be\nclothed in just such rags as he wanders among men—\nthat is, if he’s still living, and sees the light of the sun!\nBut if he’s already dead, down in Hades’ realm, then woe\nis me for peerless Odysseus, who put me in charge\nof his cattle, when I was a boy still, in Kephallenian country.\nBy now they’ve bred past counting: no other way\ncould you get a better harvest of broad-browed cattle!\nBut others now order me to drive these cows in for them\nto eat! They pay no attention to the son of the house,\nnor does the gods’ wrath scare them: these days they’re bent\non sharing out the possessions of their long-absent lord!\nHere is a problem that the heart in my breast turns over\nendlessly: it would be wrong, while the son’s still alive,\nto take off, cattle and all, to the district of others,\nto alien folk: yet it’s worse to stay on here, and suffer\nmisery tending steers now claimed by somebody else!\nLong since, indeed, I’d have fled to some other strong prince,\nsince life here’s no longer endurable; but I still think\nof that unfortunate man, who might yet come back\nfrom wherever, and scatter the suitors throughout his house.”\nTo him resourceful Odysseus responded, saying: “Cowherd,\nsince you seem neither ill-intentioned nor witless, and I\ncan recognize for myself the good sense of your mind,\nI will speak out, and swear a great oath in confirmation:\nZeus, first of gods, be my witness, and this guest-friendly board,\nand the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\nthat indeed while you are here Odysseus shall come home,\nand with your own eyes you shall see, if you’re so minded,\nthe slaughter of the suitors, now lording it here.”\nTo him\nthen responded the herder of cattle, saying: “How I wish,\nstranger, that Kronos’ son would fulfill these words of yours—\nThen you’d discover my strength, and how my hands enforce it!”\nIn like manner Eumaios now prayed to all the gods\nthat quick-witted Odysseus might come back to his own home.\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nMeanwhile the suitors were busy plotting death and doom\nfor Telemachos, when a bird came close to them on the left,\na high-flighted eagle, clutching a tremulous dove. At this\nAmphinomos addressed them, saying: “This plan of ours,\nto murder Telemachos, will not, I fear, end well\nfor us, my friends: let us rather be busy with our feasting.”\nSo Amphinomos spoke, and his words were pleasing to them.\nThey made their way to the house of godlike Odysseus,\ntook off their cloaks, laid them down on the chairs and benches,\nand began the slaughter for sacrifice of large sheep,\nplump goats, and fattened hogs, with a heifer from the herd.\nThey roasted the innards and served them, and mixed the wine\nin bowls, and the swineherd passed drinking cups around,\nwhile Philoitios, leader of men, served them with bread\nin beautiful baskets, and Melanthios poured their wine.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nNow Telemachos seated Odysseus—exploiting his advantage—\nin the well-built hall, but close to the stone threshold,\nset a mean stool for him, beside a little table,\nlaid a helping of innards beside him, poured him wine\nin a golden cup, and then addressed him, saying:\n“Sit here among these men now, and drink your wine:\nI myself will protect you from the mockery and the blows\nof all the suitors, since this is no public resort\nbut the house of Odysseus—his legacy to me!\nAnd you suitors, restrain your urge to utter insults\nor use your fists, lest strife—and a fight—arise between us.”\nSo he said. Every one of them bit his lip and marveled\nat Telemachos, because of his bold outspoken manner;\nand Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, now addressed them, saying:\n“Hard though it is, Achaians, we must now accept this speech\nof Telemachos, however boldly his words threaten us—although\nhad Kronos’ son Zeus not forbidden it, we should by now\nhave stopped him short in his halls, clear speaker though he is.”\nSo Antinoos spoke; Telemachos paid no heed to what he said.\nHeralds meanwhile were leading beasts through the city\nfor a lavish sacrifice, and the long-haired Achaians gathered\nbeneath a shady grove of Apollo, the deadly archer.\nWhen they’d roasted the outer meat and drawn it off the spits\nthey shared out the portions and enjoyed a splendid feast;\nand beside Odysseus the servers set a portion equal\nto that which they got themselves: such was the command\nof Telemachos, own dear son of godlike Odysseus.\nAthene, however, would not let these haughty suitors back off\nat all from their grievous conduct: she wanted its pain to sink\nstill deeper into the heart of Laertes’ son Odysseus.\nThere was among the suitors a man bred in lawlessness,\nKtesippos by name, who had his home on Same.\nHe, confident in his possession of prodigious wealth,\nwas courting the wife of the long-absent Odysseus.\nNow he addressed himself to the arrogant suitors, saying:\n“Give ear, you proud suitors: I’ve something to say to you.\nHis portion the stranger’s long had, as is right and proper—\nan equal one: it’s neither decent nor just to short-change\nany guest of Telemachos who may come to this house!\nI too, then, will give him a present, so that he in turn\nmay offer it as a prize to the foot washer or some other\nservant here in the house of godlike Odysseus.”\nSo saying,\nhe hurled with strong hand the hoof of an ox, that he seized\nfrom the basket where it was lying; but Odysseus dodged it,\nquickly ducking his head, and masked his inner anger\nwith a bitter grimace. The ox hoof struck the solid wall.\nTelemachos addressed Ktesippos in harsh words, saying:\n“Ktesippos, this business only let you escape with your life\nsince you didn’t in fact hit the stranger: he dodged your missile!\nOtherwise I’d have run my sharp spear through your body,\nand instead of a wedding your father would have been busy\nfixing your tomb! So let no man be seen misbehaving\nhere in my house: I now note all, and grasp each detail,\ngood or bad, where, before, I was only a child. Yet still\nwe are forced to endure the spectacle of such actions\nas the slaughter of sheep, the endless consumption of wine\nand food, since it’s hard for one man to hold back many.\nCome then, harm me no further in your ill-will—though even\nshould you be determined to murder me with the bronze,\nthat too I’d rather choose: it would be far preferable\nto die than to go on witnessing these unseemly actions—\nstrangers maltreated, women servants forcibly dragged\nand manhandled everywhere in this beautiful building.”\nSo he spoke, and they all were hushed in silence. At last\nAgelaos, son of Damastor, addressed them, saying: “Friends,\nin response to what has been fairly and justly spoken\nno man should take offense, make a hostile retort.\nSo don’t treat this stranger roughly, or indeed any\nof the servants here in the house of godlike Odysseus!\nTo Telemachos and his mother I’d like to say a word\nas a friend, that might just appeal to them both at heart:\nSo long as you in your breasts still nursed the hope\nthat quick-witted Odysseus might yet return to his home,\nthere could be no objection to your holding on, and keeping\nthe suitors at bay in your house, since this was the better course\nwere Odysseus to return, back as lord in his own domain;\nbut it’s clear enough now that he’s never going to return—\nso, Telemachos, sit by your mother and tell her this:\nshe should wed the best of these men, who offers her most:\nthat way you’ll enjoy your inheritance undiminished,\neating and drinking, while she can keep house for someone else.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“No, Agelaos, by Zeus, and by the sufferings of my father.\nwho may have died, or be wandering yet, far from Ithake,\nno way am I delaying my mother’s marriage—I’ve told her\nto wed any man she wants to: I’ll give them countless presents!\nBut I’d be ashamed, were she unwilling, to force her\nout of this house—may no god ever bring such a thing to pass!”\nSo Telemachos spoke. But Pallas Athene now stirred in\nthe suitors laughter unquenchable, sent their wits astray:\nthe jaws from which laughter issued seemed not their own,\nand the meat they were eating bloodstained, while their eyes\nwere brimming with tears, and their minds imagined wailing.\nThen godlike Theoklymenos spoke up among them, saying:\n“Wretched men! What’s this horror you’re suffering? Your heads\nand faces, your knees beneath them, are shrouded in night—\nlamentation’s afire, all dabbled with tears your cheeks,\nblood-bespattered the walls and elegant panels;\ncrowded with ghosts is the forecourt, crowded the yard,\nall flocking in darkness to Erebos, for now the sun\nhas perished from heaven, a foul fog’s swept over all.”\nSo he spoke; but all of them crowed with laughter at him,\nand Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, made the first comment, saying:\n“He’s out of his mind, is this stranger just come from elsewhere!\nQuick, boys, out of the house with him, have him go down\nto the marketplace, since he finds it dark as night in here.”\nTo him godlike Theoklymenos then responded, saying:\n“Eurymachos, I’m not asking you to provide me with guides!\nI still have my own eyes and ears and both my feet,\nand a mind in my breast in no way wrongly fashioned.\nUsing them I shall quit this house, for I sense trouble coming\nupon you that none of the suitors may escape or avoid\nwho here in the house of godlike Odysseus abuse\nother men with violence, commit acts of reckless folly.”\nSo saying, he walked out of that pleasantly sited house,\nand went to Peiraios, who gave him a friendly welcome.\nNow all the suitors, glancing at one another, tried\nto provoke Telemachos by mocking his guests. And thus\nwould one of these haughty youths harangue him, saying:\n“Telemachos, no one has worse luck than you with his guests!\nLike this vagrant here, brought in, whom you maintain—\nalways wanting food and wine, no good at work,\nno strength, nothing but a mere burden on the earth!\nAnd now this other fellow, who stood up and prophesied!\nIf you took my advice, you’d do far better to let us\nthrow these strangers aboard a ship of many rowlocks\nand send them off to the Sikels: they’d fetch you a good price.”\nSo spoke the suitors. Telemachos paid no heed to what they said,\nbut sat silently watching his father, always ready\nfor the moment when he’d lay hands on the shameless suitors.\nIkarios’ prudent daughter Penelope had set down\nher elegant chair so it faced them: she could now hear\nwhat each man was saying, there in the hall. For while\nthey were laughing, they’d also been readying their dinner—\nsweet and satisfying, since they’d slaughtered so many beasts.\nYet no more unpleasant supper could there have been\nthan the one that a goddess and a powerful man\nwould soon serve to those who’d started such vile misdeeds.\n",

         "\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, now put it into the mind\nof Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelope, to bring out\nand set before the suitors the bow and the grey iron\nin Odysseus’ halls: a contest, and the start of the slaughter.\nShe climbed the high ladder that led to her own chamber,\nand with her strong hand picked up the neatly hooked key—\nbronze, finely wrought, with a fitted ivory handle—\nand made her way, with her handmaids, to the very furthest\nstoreroom, where were laid up her lord’s rich treasures:\nitems of bronze and gold and carefully worked iron.\nThere too was stored his back-bent bow and the quiver\nthat held the arrows, and many the hurtful shafts packed in it,\ngifts that a guest-friend gave him when they met in in Lakedaimon—\nIphitos, Eurytos’ son, in appearance like the immortals:\nthe two had encountered one another in Messene\nat the house of skillful Ortilochos. In fact Odysseus\nwas after a public debt then owed by the people:\nfor the men of Messene had come in their many-oared ships\nand lifted three hundred sheep from Ithake, with their shepherds.\nIt was for these that Odysseus had traveled far on a mission\nwhile still a youth, dispatched by his father and other elders.\nIphitos too was there in search of horses he’d lost:\na dozen brood mares, with sturdy suckling mules—\nthough these afterwards brought about his destined murder,\nwhen he came to that stout-hearted son of Zeus, the mighty\nHerakles, well acquainted with violent labors, who\nkilled him, guest though he was, and in his own house—\nmerciless man!—regardless of the gods’ wrath and the table\nhe’d set before Iphitos. The man himself he slaughtered,\nand the strong-hoofed mares he kept in his own domain.\nIt was on his quest for these that Iphitos met Odysseus,\nand gave him the bow once carried by great Eurytos, who\nleft it after his death to his son in his high abode;\nwhile Odysseus gave to Iphitos a sharp sword and a sturdy spear,\nthe start of a binding guest-friendship, yet they never\nknew one another at table; before that, the son of Zeus\nslew Iphitos, Eurytos’ son, in appearance like the immortals,\nwho gave the bow to Odysseus. But Odysseus never\ntook it with him when he went to war aboard the black ships:\nhe left it to lie there at home, a memento of a good friend.\nHe only ever carried it while still in his own country.\nWhen Penelope, bright among women, reached the storeroom,\nand stepped up to the oaken threshold—which a carpenter once\nhad expertly planed and fitted true to the level,\nand set up the doorposts on it, and the shining doors on them—\nat once she briskly detached the thong from its hook,\nand thrust in the key, and shot back the bolts from the doors\nwith a sure aim: they groaned loudly, the noise a bull makes\nas it grazes in pasture: so groaned the beautiful doors,\nattacked by the key, and swiftly flew open for her.\nShe made for a high platform, where stood various chests\nin which fragrant garments were stored. There, reaching up\non tiptoe, she grasped and removed from its peg the bow\ntogether with the bright bow-case in which it was held.\nThis done, she sat down, with the case placed across her knees,\nand burst into loud sobs as she took out her husband’s bow.\nThen, when she’d had her fill of tearful lamentation,\nshe made her way to the hall, where the haughty suitors were,\ncarrying in her hands the back-bent bow, with the quiver\nthat held the arrows, and many a hurtful shaft within it.\nServing women came with her, bearing a chest in which\nmuch iron and bronze lay stored, her husband’s prizes.\nWhen she, bright among women, came where the suitors were,\nshe stood by the central post of the snugly timbered roof,\nholding up her shining veil in front of her face\nand flanked on either side by a devoted handmaid,\nand at once she addressed the suitors, saying: “Hear me,\nyou overbold suitors, you who’ve been using this house\nas a base for feasting and drinking—continually, endlessly—\nwhile its master’s been so long absent; nor could you think up\nany other excuse to offer in support of your presence\nexcept your urge to wed me, make me your wife!—now come,\nsince here, plain as day, is a contest for all you suitors\nthat I’ll set before you: the great bow of godlike Odysseus!\nWhoever, handling this bow, shall string it most easily,\nand then shoot an arrow clear through all twelve axes,\nwith him I’ll depart, leaving this house I first came to\nas a wedded wife—a fine home, and full of rich possessions!\nI think I shall always remember it, even in my dreams.”\nSo she spoke, and then ordered Eumaios, the noble swineherd,\nto set up for the suitors the bow and the grey iron.\nWeeping, Eumaios took and arranged them: the cowherd too\nburst into tears at the sight of his master’s bow. But now\nAntinoos spoke in reproof, and addressed them, saying:\n“Stupid yokels, only concerned with things of the day!\nWhy, wretched pair, are you blubbering? It only agitates\nthe heart in your mistress’ breast! And that heart, as it is,\nlies grief-stricken, since she’s lost her beloved bedfellow!\nEither sit here and feast in silence, or, if cry you must,\ngo and do it outside. But the bow you must leave back here,\na decisive test for the suitors, for I don’t imagine\nthis polished bow will prove an easy one to be strung:\namong all this crowd here there’s not a single man\nsuch as Odysseus was—for I saw him myself,\nand remember him well, though then I was only a child.”\nSo he spoke; but the heart in his breast still hoped that he himself\nwould string the bow, shoot a shaft clear through the iron.\nIn fact, he would be the first to sample an arrow shot\nby that same peerless Odysseus, whom, as he sat in the hall,\nhe was now insulting, and urging his comrades to do likewise.\nThen Telemachos, princely in power, addressed them, saying:\n“Surely Kronos’ son Zeus must have rendered me witless!\nMy own\ndear mother, sensible though she is, declares\nshe’ll abandon this house and go with another husband—\nand yet I, in my witless mind, laugh and enjoy the fun!\nBut come now, you suitors, since here’s the prize before you:\na lady the like of whom there’s none now in all Achaia,\nor sacred Pylos, or Argos, or Mykenai, or even Ithake\nitself, or on the dark mainland. But you yourselves\nknow all this: what need for me to praise my mother?\nSo, don’t sidetrack the matter in hand with excuses, stop\nputting off the bow’s stringing: let’s get to see it now!\nIndeed, I myself might make trial of the bow—and if\nI should string it, and shoot an arrow through the iron,\nI shan’t have to worry about my lady mother leaving\nthis house with another man: I shall still be here, one now\nwell able to win my own father’s splendid contests.”\nWith that he stripped off the scarlet cloak from his shoulders,\nunslung his sharp sword, and sprang to his feet. He then\nfirst of all set up the axes. He dug a trench, a single\nlong trench for them all, cut true to a line, and tamped\nthe earth down round them. All watching him were amazed\nthat he set them up right, having never seen them before.\nThis done, he went to the threshold, to make trial of the bow.\nThree times he made it quiver in his effort to bend it;\nthree times he gave up, though privately he still hoped\nto string the bow and to shoot an arrow through the iron.\nAt his fourth attempt, indeed, he’d have drawn and strung it,\nso determined he was; but Odysseus shook his head, and stopped him.\nTelemachos, princely in power, again addressed them, saying:\n“Oh damn it, even in time to come I’ll be mean and feeble,\nor else I’m too young still, can’t rely on the strength of my hands\nto defend me against some man who starts a quarrel!\nSo come now, all you whose strength is greater than mine,\nmake trial of the bow, and let’s wind up this contest.”\nSo he spoke and grounded the bow, left it standing against\nthe close-fitting, well-polished door panels; and there too\nhe propped a swift arrow against the elegant door hook.\nThen he sat down again on the fine chair from which he’d risen.\nAntinoos now addressed them, the son of Eupeithes, saying:\n“All of you up in order, my comrades, from left to right,\nbeginning from where the cupbearer pours the wine.”\nSo spoke Antinoos, and what he said found approval.\nThe first to stand up was Leiodes, son of Oinops,\ntheir diviner, who always sat at the back of the hall\nby the beautiful mixing bowl: to him alone their reckless\nconduct was hateful. He disapproved of all the suitors.\nHe now was the first to take the bow and swift arrow:\nhe went and stood at the threshold, made trial of the bow,\nbut failed to bend it. His hands—tender, unhardened—\ntoo soon wearied of pulling. He addressed the suitors, saying:\n“Friends, I’m unable to bend it—let another man now try!\nMany the lordly men this bow is going to deprive\nof spirit and life, since indeed it’s far preferable to die\nthan live on after failing at that in pursuit of which\nwe continue assembling here, in daily expectation!\nAt present a man can still not only want but hope\nto marry Penelope, the bedfellow of Odysseus;\nbut when he’s made trial of the bow, and seen the result,\nthen let him court with his gifts some other finely costumed\nAchaian woman, and let Penelope marry whoever\nmakes her the best offer, and comes as her fated spouse.”\nSo he spoke and grounded the bow, left it standing against\nthe close-fitting, polished door panels; and there too\nhe propped a swift arrow, against the elegant door hook.\nThen he sat down again on the fine chair from which he’d risen.\nBut Antinoos spoke in reproof, and addressed him, saying:\n“Leiodes,\nwhat’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth,\nso fearful and grievous an utterance? To hear it enrages me!\nif it’s true that this bow will deprive many lordly men\nof spirit and life, because you yourself can’t bend it,\neven so, though your lady mother didn’t bear you to be\nstrong enough to string bows or shoot arrows, nevertheless\nother proud suitors there are who’ll bend it soon enough!”\nSo he spoke, and gave orders to Melanthios the goatherd:\n“To work, Melanthios! Get the fire going here in the hall,\nand beside it put a large chair with a fleece spread on it,\nand fetch out the big wheel of tallow you’ll find inside,\nso that we youths may warm the bow, and grease it with fat,\nand so get to make trial of it, and conclude this contest.”\nSo he spoke. Melanthios rekindled the unwearying fire,\nfetched, and set close by, a chair with a fleece spread on it,\nthen brought out the large wheel of tallow he found inside.\nWith this the youths warmed the bow, then tried it, but still\nfailed to bend it. They had nothing near the needed strength.\nBut Antinoos still held back, as did godlike Eurymachos:\nthey were the leading suitors, and far the best in prowess.\nTwo men now left the hall, going out together,\nthe cowherd and swineherd of godlike Odysseus; and he,\nnoble Odysseus himself, went close behind them.\nBut when they were all outside the gates and the courtyard,\nthen he spoke, and addressed them in friendly manner, saying:\n“Cowherd, and you too, swineherd, shall I tell you something\nor keep it to myself? Oh, my heart impels me to speak!\nHow would you feel about supporting Odysseus, were he\nsuddenly to appear from somewhere, brought by some god?\nWould you be on the side of the suitors, or of Odysseus?\nTell me whatever your heart and spirit dictate!”\nIn answer\nthe herdsman who cared for the cattle responded, saying:\n“Zeus, Father, would that you might fulfill this wish! Now grant\nthat man his return, and a god to escort him! Then\nyou’d learn what strength I have, and how my hands employ it!”\nEumaios in the same way likewise prayed to all the gods\nthat quick-witted Odysseus might return to his own home.\nSo when he’d found out for certain how these two were minded,\nOdysseus once more responded, and addressed them, saying:\n“Back home now indeed I am! After suffering much hardship\nI’ve returned, in the twentieth year, to my native country!\nI know that to both of you, alone of all my servants,\nmy arrival is truly welcome: of the rest I’ve not heard one\npray that I might return, make it back to my home!\nSo to you two I’ll speak the truth, how it’s going to be:\nif a god grants me victory over these haughty suitors,\nI’ll find wives for you both, and give you possessions,\nand houses built close to my own; and for me thereafter\nyou’ll be Telemachos’ comrades, indeed his brethren!\nAnd look, I’ll show you another manifest sign\nby which you may know me for sure and trust what I say—\nthe scar of the wound that I got from a boar’s white tusk\nlong ago, when I went up Parnassos with Autolykos’ sons.”\nSo saying, he pulled back his rags from over the great scar.\nWhen the two had examined it carefully, in detail,\nweeping they flung their arms about skillful Odysseus\nand kissed his head and his shoulders in loving welcome,\nwhile Odysseus likewise was kissing their heads and hands.\nAnd now the sun would have gone down on their tears\nhad not Odysseus himself put a stop to it, saying: “Quit\nyour weeping and wailing! Somebody coming out here\nfrom the hall might see us and report back to those inside.\nNow, you two go on in, but separately, not together—\nI’ll go first, you after me. And let’s have this as a signal:\nall the others, the whole crowd of these haughty suitors,\nwon’t agree to me being given the bow and the quiver;\nbut you, noble Eumaios, as you go through the house\nwith the bow, put it into my hands—and order the women\nto bar the close-fitting doors at the entrance to their quarters;\nand if any of them hear groans, or the thud of falling\nmen within our walls, they’re not to go out, but remain\njust where they are, keep silent, and go on with their work.\nAnd to you, noble Philoitios, I entrust the task of bolting\nthe courtyard gates, and quickly roping them shut as well.”\nSo saying, he made his way into the pleasantly sited house,\nand went and sat down on the chair from which he’d risen;\ngodlike Odysseus’ two servants then followed him inside.\nEurymachos was now turning the bow about in his hands,\nwarming it, this side and that, in the fire’s glow; yet not even\nthus could he bend it: his lordly heart was sore vexed,\nand, deeply troubled, he now addressed them, saying:\n“Alas, here’s distress for myself and for all of you too!\nIt’s not this lost marriage that I lament so much,\ngrieved though I am; there are many Achaian ladies,\nsome here on sea-girt Ithake, and more in other cities.\nBut if we’re so far lacking in strength compared\nto godlike Odysseus that we can’t even bend and string\nhis bow—that’s a disgrace that men yet unborn will hear of.”\nAntinoos, son of Eupeithes, then responded to him, saying:\n“It will not be so, Eurymachos, as you know very well!\nThroughout the region this is the god’s solemn feast day—\nwho’d be bending a bow now? Today we’ll take things easy,\nso put that aside! And why don’t we leave all the axes standing\nwhere they are? No one, I think, is going to come here, to the hall\nof Odysseus, Laertes’ son, and remove them! So for now\nlet the wine steward pour the initial drops in our cups\nso we can offer libations, and lay the curved bow aside;\nthen early tomorrow morning tell the goatherd Melanthios\nto bring the very best she-goats in all the herds, so we\nmay offer thigh-pieces to Apollo the famous archer,\nand then make trial of the bow and conclude the contest.”\nSo spoke Antinoos, and what he said found approval.\nNow the heralds poured water over their hands, and youths\nfilled up the mixing-bowls with drink, poured drops\ninto the cups for libation, then served wine to all.\nAfter they’d offered libations and drunk all they’d a mind to,\nresourceful Odysseus addressed them, with deception in mind:\n“Listen to me, you suitors of the illustrious queen,\nto what the heart in my breast now urges me to tell you!\nTo Eurymachos most of all, and to godlike Antinoos\nI appeal, since the latter got it right when he said\nthat for now you should put the bow by, let the gods decide—\nIn the morning the god will confer the power where he wishes!\nBut come, give the polished bow to me, that here among you\nI may try out my hands and strength, see whether the force\nis still there, as when my limbs were supple, or whether\nby now lack of care and vagrancy have destroyed it.”\nSo he spoke, and they all expressed high indignation,\nafraid as they were that he might string the polished bow.\nSo Antinoos spoke in reproof, and addressed him, saying:\n“Ah, wretched stranger, devoid of even the slightest sense!\nIs it not enough for you that you dine at ease among us,\nyour betters, that you’re barred from none of the feast, sit in\non all our conversation, when there’s no other stranger\nor beggar who gets to listen to everything we say?\nIt’s the wine, the honey-sweet wine, that damages you, just as\nit harms anyone who swills it, who drinks to excess! It was wine\nthat infatuated the Centaur, far-famed Eurytion,\nin the hall of great-hearted Peirithoos, when he went\nto visit the Lapiths: there, wits fuddled with wine,\nin his madness he wrought evil in Peirithoos’ house.\nOutraged, the heroes sprang on him, dragged him outside\nthrough the forecourt, cut off his ears and nose\nwith the pitiless bronze; and he, now stupefied in mind,\nwent about with his unstable spirit bearing that fatal burden.\nHence sprang the feud between the Centaurs and mankind;\nbut he first for himself met trouble, when heavy with wine.\nAnd for you I foresee great misery should you indeed\nbend and string this bow: you’ll find no courtesy here\nin our district—we’ll send you straight off in a black ship\nto King Echetos, maimer of all mortal men alive,\nfrom whom you would have no escape. So now sit quiet,\ndrink your wine, don’t contend with men younger than yourself.”\nPrudent Penelope responded to him, saying: “It’s neither\ndecent nor just, Antinoos, to deprive Telemachos’ guests\n—whoever may come to the house here—of their proper due!\nDo you expect, if this stranger, trusting his hands and strength,\nstrings the great bow of Odysseus, that he’ll then take me\noff to his home, and make me his bedfellow? I’m sure\nthat he himself now nurses no such expectation!\nSo none of you need to worry on that account, or let it\nspoil your appetite here: that indeed would be unseemly.”\nEurymachos, Polybos’ son, then responded to her, saying:\n“Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelope, we don’t think\nthis man will make off with you—yes, that would be unseemly!—\nbut the gossip of men and women could embarrass us: some low\nAchaian lout may well later start saying this kind of thing:\n‘Oh yes, far weaker men now are courting the bedfellow\nof a faultless man—they can’t even string his polished bow!\nBut some other fellow, a vagrant beggar, who turned up here\nstrung the bow easily, and shot clear through the iron.’\nSo men will talk, and this would be a reproach to us all.”\nThen prudent Penelope once more responded to him, saying:\n“Eurymachos, no way can good report spread in public\nabout those who devour, and so dishonor, a nobleman’s\nhousehold goods! Why make this, then, a matter for reproach?\nThe stranger’s a very big fellow, and strongly built; he also\nclaims he’s the son of a father of excellent ancestry.\nSo give him the polished bow now, and let’s see what happens!\nFor this I’ll declare to you, and it shall come to pass:\nif he does string the bow, and Apollo lets him triumph,\nI’ll dress him in cloak and tunic, fine quality garments,\nand give him a sharpened javelin, to ward off dogs and men,\nand a double-edged sword, and sandals to strap on under\nhis feet, and send him wherever his heart and spirit dictate.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“There’s not one Achaian, my mother, more entitled than myself\nto give, or refuse, this bow to whomsoever I please—\nnot any of those who hold power here on rugged Ithake,\nor lord it over the islands toward horse-pasturing Elis!\nOf these none will thwart my will, even if I choose to make\nan outright gift of the bow, for this stranger to carry off!\nInto the house with you now, attend to your own tasks—\nthe loom and the distaff! And give orders to your handmaids\nto stick to their proper work! The bow shall be men’s business—\nall men’s, but mine above all: in this house I hold the power.”\nAstonished, Penelope went back into the house,\nand took to heart her son’s sagacious remarks.\nshe climbed to her upper chamber with her handmaids,\nand there she wept for Odysseus, her dear husband, until\ngrey-eyed Athene shed sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\nThe noble swineherd now picked up the curved bow,\nand was bearing it off; but the suitors all clamored in the hall,\nand thus would one of the arrogant younger men exclaim:\n“Where, wretched swineherd, are you taking that curved bow?\nAre you crazy? The hunting dogs you bred yourself will soon\nwolf you down, all alone among your pigs, if Apollo\nlooks kindly upon us—he, and the other immortal gods.”\nSo they spoke. Right there he dropped the bow where he stood,\nterrified: they were so many, the noise in the hall so loud.\nBut Telemachos shouted threateningly from the other side:\n“Old fellow, keep on with the bow! Obey them, and you’ll be sorry!\nThough I’m younger than you I’ll chase you out to the fields\nwith a shower of stones! At least I’m stronger than you!\nI only wish I was tougher, and a better man with my fists,\nthan all the suitors arrayed here in these halls: then I’d\nsoon send some of them packing from our house\nin a dire state, because of the trouble they make here.”\nSo he spoke, but the suitors all laughed cheerfully at him,\nforgetting the bitter resentment that they’d long nursed\nagainst Telemachos. The swineherd carried the bow\nthrough the hall to skillful Odysseus, placed it in his hands,\nthen summoned the nurse Eurykleia, and addressed her, saying:\n“Orders for you from Telemachos, prudent Eurykleia:\nyou’re to bar the close-fitted doors at the entrance to your quarters,\nand if any of you hear groans or the thud of falling\nmen here within our walls, they’re not to go out, but remain\njust where they are, keep silent, and go on with their work.”\nSo he spoke; but her answer remained unwinged. She went\nand barred the doors of their pleasantly sited quarters,\nwhile Philoitios said nothing, but hurried out of the house,\nand barred the gates to the well-walled courtyard. Down\nin the colonnade there lay coiled a shapely vessel’s\nfiber cable: with this he secured the gates, and himself\nwent back in, sat down on the chair from which he’d risen,\nand watched Odysseus, who was already handling the bow,\nkept turning it round, made trial of it this way and that,\nto see if worms had eaten the horn in its master’s absence;\nand thus would an onlooker speak, with a glance at his neighbor:\n“He must be a connoisseur, some kind of expert in bows!\nEither he himself has such fine bows stored back home,\nor else he intends to make one, the way he turns it about\nthis way and that—evildoer and vagrant that he is!”\nAnd another of these haughty youths would speak up, saying:\n“I wish just as much good fortune for this old fellow\nas he’s likely to get in the contest for stringing the bow.”\nSuch was the talk of the suitors. But resourceful Odysseus,\nas soon as he’d got his great bow and viewed it all over—\njust as a man, a professional lyre player and singer,\nwill easily stretch the string around a new peg, secure\nthe twisted sheep gut at either end, so now\nOdysseus without hard effort strung the great bow,\nand took it in his right hand, and tested the string,\nwhich sang good and high at his touch, like a swallow’s voice.\nThe suitors were much distressed. The faces of them all\nchanged color. Zeus thundered loudly, making plain his signs,\nand much-enduring noble Odysseus now rejoiced\nthat sly-counselling Kronos’ son had sent him an omen.\nHe picked up the swift shaft that lay there on the table,\nready (the rest were still stored in their hollow quiver—\nthose arrows that the Achaians were soon to experience),\nset it on the bow’s hand grip, then—still seated\nthere in his chair—drew the string with the notched arrow,\ntook careful aim, and let fly. He did not miss one helve base\nof all the axes: clean through and out at the end\nflew his bronze-heavy shaft. He addressed Telemachos, saying:\n“The stranger that sits in your hall, Telemachos, does you no\ndiscredit: I neither missed the mark, nor spent\nmuch labor on stringing the bow. My strength is still there—\nnot gone, as these suitors insult me by claiming so mockingly!\nBut now it’s time to get dinner ready for the Achaians—\nin daylight. And after that there’s other entertainment,\nsongs and the lyre, the accompaniment to feasting.”\nThen godlike Odysseus signaled them with his eyebrows,\nand his dear son Telemachos strapped on his keen-edged sword,\nand put out a hand to the spear, tipped with gleaming bronze,\nthat was standing close to him, propped up beside his chair.\n",

         "\nNow resourceful Odysseus stripped himself of his rags\nand sprang up on the great threshold, taking the bow\nand the shaft-packed quiver. He poured out the swift arrows\nthere at his feet, and addressed the suitors, saying:\n“This contest’s over, decisively ended; and now\nI’ll go for another target, reached by no man hitherto,\nto see whether I can hit it, and Apollo grant me glory.”\nHe spoke, and then aimed a bitter shaft at Antinoos,\nwho was on the point of raising an elegant cup to his lips—\ngolden, twin-eared—had it in his hands, was intending\nto drink wine from it: in his mind was no thought of death.\nFor who amid fellow feasters would ever imagine\nthat one man, however strong, alone against many,\nwould contrive for him a bad death and black fate? But Odysseus\ntook aim and struck him in the throat with his arrow,\nand clear through the tender neck the point was driven,\nand he slumped to one side, the cup dropped from his hand\nwhen he was hit, and up through his nostrils at once\ncame a thick spurt of human blood; a kick of his foot\nsent the table flying, scattered all the food on the floor,\nbread and roast meat in the dirt together. The suitors\nmade an uproar throughout the hall when they saw the man\nfallen: sprang from their seats, panic-stricken, in the hall,\nlooking all round at the solid walls, but nowhere\nwas there a shield or strong spear that they could grab.\nSo they abused Odysseus in furious words, declaring:\n“It’s an outrage, stranger, for you to shoot men! You’ll never\ncompete in another contest! Now you’ve sealed your fate!\nThe man you killed was by far the noblest of the youths\non Ithake: because of that the vultures shall eat you here.”\nSo said each of them, for indeed they supposed he’d not\nkilled the man on purpose: poor fools, they had no notion\nthat over them all the bonds of destruction were set.\nThen, with an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus replied:\n“You dogs, you thought that I’d never come home again\nfrom the Trojans’ land, the way you ravaged my house,\nand forcibly bedded my women servants, and while\nI was still alive, underhandedly courted my wife,\nwith no fear of the gods who own broad heaven,\nor of any human reproof that might come hereafter!\nNow over you all the bonds of destruction are set!”\nSo he spoke. Pale dread possessed them all: each man\nlooked round for a way to escape from sheer destruction.\nOnly Eurymachos now responded to him, saying:\n“If you indeed are Odysseus, come home to Ithake, then\nwhat you say about all the Achaians have done is just—\nmany their wanton acts, here in the house, out afield!\nBut the man lies dead who was to blame for it all—\nAntinoos! He it was who instigated these deeds,\nnot so much out of desire or need for the marriage,\nbut with a different aim, not fulfilled by Kronos’ son:\nthat over well-ordered Ithake he might himself\nbe king—and lie in wait for your son and kill him!\nNow he’s been fairly slain, spare these people: they are\nyour own! And hereafter we’ll collect you reparation\nfor all that’s been drunk or eaten here in this hall,\neach man providing you with the worth of twenty oxen!\nWe’ll requite you in bronze and gold until your heart is softened;\nbut until that time comes no man could blame you for your anger.”\nThen. with an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded:\n“Eurymachos, were you to give me all you had from your fathers,\nall that you now possess, plus what you could find elsewhere,\nnot even so would I stay my hands from slaughter\nuntil the suitors had paid the full price for their wrongdoing!\nNow it’s your choice whether you’ll stand and fight me\nor run—if anyone here can dodge death and its spirits;\nbut none of you, I think, will escape from sheer destruction.”\nSo he spoke: there and then their knees and hearts gave way.\nBut Eurymachos now spoke again, and addressed them, saying:\n“Friends, this man won’t restrain his invincible hands!\nNow he’s got control of the polished bow and its quiver\nhe’ll shoot from the smooth-worn threshold until he’s killed\nevery last one of us! We must think about how to fight him!\nSo draw your swords now, hold the tables in front of you\nagainst his swift deadly arrows, and then let’s all go for him\nin a body, try to shift him from the threshold and doorway,\nthen get to the city, raise a quick hue and cry. Do that,\nand this fellow will soon have shot his last shaft.”\nSo saying,\nhe now unsheathed his sharp sword, fashioned of bronze,\nwith its double edge, and made for Odysseus, yelling out\nhis fearsome war cry. At the same instant noble Odysseus\nlet fly another arrow. The swift shaft struck his breast\nunder the nipple, drove into his liver. He dropped his sword\non the ground, and fell, doubled up and sprawling, over\nthe table: the food all went flying to the ground, along with\nhis two-handled cup. His forehead smashed agonizingly\ninto the ground; both feet kicked out at his chair,\ndislodging it. A mist closed down over his eyes.\nAmphinomos next attacked renowned Odysseus, charging\nstraight at him, keen-edged sword ready and drawn, to see\nif he could force him back from the doorway. Telemachos\nwas too quick, aimed from behind with his bronze-tipped spear,\nand hit him between the shoulders, drove right through\nhis breast. He fell with a thud, hit the ground forehead first.\nBut Telemachos sprang back, left his far-shadowing spear\nthere in Amphinomos, much afraid that some Achaian—\nwhile he was busy prising that long spear loose—might rush up\nand give him a sword thrust, catch him still stooping. So he\nset off at a run, quickly reached his dear father, stood close\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “Father,\nI’ll go now and fetch you a shield and a couple of spears,\nand an all-bronze helmet, close-fitting at the temples.\nI’ll arm myself too while I’m gone, and get arms for the swineherd\nand the cowherd too: for sure, to be in armor is better.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Run, fetch them, while I still have arrows for my defense,\nlest they force me away from the doors, all alone as I am.”\nSo he spoke, and Telemachos, in obedience to his father,\nmade his way to the storeroom where their fine arms were kept,\nand from there collected four shields, eight spears, and four\nbronze-plated helmets, decked with thick crests of horsehair.\nCarrying these, he quickly returned to his dear father.\nThen, first, he armored his own body in bronze,\nand the two servants likewise put on their splendid gear,\nand stood there flanking clever, subtle-minded Odysseus.\nHe, while he still had arrows for his defense, went after\nthe suitors, one by one, never stopping, there in his house,\naiming, then shooting. They kept falling, thick and fast.\nBut when the master had no more arrows to shoot,\nthe bow he propped up against the pleasantly sited hall’s\ndoorpost, to stand by the bright inner walls. He now\nslung from his shoulders a fourfold shield, and on\nhis powerful head next settled a well-made helmet\nwith a horsehair plume nodding fearsomely up above,\nand took two sturdy spears, both tipped with bronze.\nThere existed a side postern set in the solid wall,\nflush with the top of the pleasantly sited hall’s threshold,\nthat led into a corridor and had a close-fitting door.\nOn this corridor Odysseus ordered the noble swineherd\nto keep a close watch (one man only could rush it at a time),\nsince Agelaos had called out to all the suitors, saying:\n“Friends, won’t one of you now slip out by that side postern,\nget word to the people, raise a quick hue and cry? Do that,\nand this fellow will soon have taken his last shot.”\nThen Melanthios, herder of goats, responded to him, saying:\n“That won’t work, Agelaos, Zeus’ nursling: the fine courtyard\ndoors are dangerously close, and the corridor is narrow:\none man, if a good fighter, could hold off all comers. So let me\ngo fetch armor for us to put on, from his private storeroom;\nfor that, I’m certain, and no place else, is where\nOdysseus and his illustrious son have stowed their gear.”\nSo saying, Melanthios, herder of goats, went up\nby the steps of the hall to the storerooms of Odysseus.\nFrom there he took twelve shields, and a dozen spears,\nand as many bronze helmets with thick horsehair crests,\nand made his way back, and quickly gave them to the suitors.\nThen Odysseus’ knees and courage both wilted as he saw them\ngirding themselves in armor and brandishing long spears\nin their hands, and huge his task now appeared to him,\nand at once he addressed Telemachos with winged words, saying:\n“Telemachos, it must be one of the women in the halls\nis backing this bad fight against us—or maybe Melanthios.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“I myself, father, made the mistake here—no one else\nis to blame! It was I who left the close-fitting door\nof the storeroom ajar: they kept a sharper watch than I did!\nYou go now, noble Eumaios, and shut that storeroom door,\nand see if it’s one of the women who’s behind this, or,\nas I suspect, Melanthios, Dolios’ son.”\nSuch was\nthe conversation between them, one to the other.\nBut Melanthios, herder of goats, went back to the storeroom\nto fetch more fine armor. The noble swineherd saw him,\nand at once addressed Odysseus, close by him, saying:\n“Scion of Zeus, Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\nthere’s that dangerous busybody—the one we ourselves\nsuspect—off back to the storeroom! So tell me truthfully,\nam I to kill the man, if I prove the better fighter,\nor bring him here to you, to pay for the misdemeanors,\nall of them, that he’s committed here in your house?”\nTo him\nResourceful Odysseus then responded, saying: “For sure,\nI and Telemachos will hold off these haughty suitors,\nkeep them shut in the hall here, however hard they struggle!\nYou two should force both that man’s hands and feet\nbehind his back, lash them to boards there, dump him\ninto the storeroom, attach a braided rope to his body,\nhoist him up the tall column until he’s near the roof beams:\nthat way he’ll stay alive longest and suffer real agony.”\nSo he spoke. They listened carefully and obeyed him.\nTo the storeroom they went, unnoticed by the man inside,\nwho was searching for armor far in the back. The two\nlay in wait for him, standing on either side of the doorway.\nWhen Melanthios, herder of goats, was crossing the threshold—\nin one hand a splendid helmet, and in the other\nan old broad shield, that was all befouled with mildew\nand belonged to the hero Laertes, who’d carried it when young,\nbut it had long been laid up, the seams of its straps were rotted—\nthe two sprang, seized him, dragged him in by his hair,\nflung him down, sore anguished at heart, on the ground.\nThey lashed his hands and feet tight with agonizing bonds,\nforcing them right behind his back, exactly the way\nthat Laertes’ son, much-enduring noble Odysseus\nhad told them to do. They attached a braided rope to his body,\nand hauled him up the tall column until he was near the roof beams.\nThen, swineherd Eumaios, you made mock of him, saying:\n“This way, Melanthios, you’ll keep watch the whole night,\nlying there on the kind of soft bed that’s proper for you;\nnor shall Dawn, early risen, coming up from Ocean’s streams\nin gold-throned splendor escape your notice as you\nbring the suitors your she-goats to set up a feast in the hall.”\nSo he was left there, stretched tight in his deadly bonds,\nwhile the two put on their armor, closed the bright door,\nand made their way back to clever, subtle-minded Odysseus.\nThere they stood on the threshold, breathing courage,\nfour men against a crowd of good fighters in the feast hall.\nThen Zeus’ daughter Athene came up close to them,\nassuming the likeness of Mentor, in both voice and person.\nOdysseus rejoiced at the sight of her, and addressed her, saying:\n“Mentor, defend us from harm, remember your dear comrade\nwho used to do you good turns: you and I are the same age.”\nSo he spoke: but he guessed it was Athene the host-rallier.\nThe suitors across from him made an uproar in the hall\nand the first to rebuke Athene was Damastor’s son Agelaos:\n“Mentor, don’t let Odysseus sidetrack you with his glib talk\ninto fighting against the suitors and giving aid to him!\nFor this is how I think our purpose will be accomplished:\nwhen we kill these men, both father and son, you too\nwill be slain along with them, for the deeds you’re so eager\nto perform in these halls: with your own head you’ll pay for them!\nAnd when with the bronze we’ve stripped you of your violence,\nall the possessions you have, whether indoor or outside,\nwe’ll add to those of Odysseus! We won’t let your sons live\nin your halls, nor grant your daughters or your good wife\nthe right to move freely about Ithake.”\nSo he spoke,\nand Athene grew even more furious at heart,\nand upbraided Odysseus with angry words: “No longer\nis your courage steadfast, Odysseus, nor that fine prowess\nyou showed when over Helen—high-born, white-armed—\nfor nine years you fought the Trojans unceasingly,\nand many fighters you killed in that dread conflict—\nit was your advice brought down Priam’s broad-wayed city!\nWhy then now, when you’re back to home and possessions,\ndo you wail at the thought of facing up to the suitors?\nSo come here, my friend, stand beside me, watch me at work,\nand see the way, when up against hostile fighters,\nthat Alkimos’ son Mentor repays your good services!”\nShe spoke, yet still did not give him enough strength to prevail\nin his battle, was still making trial of the might and valor\nboth of Odysseus himself and of his illustrious son.\nAnd now she flew up to a roof beam of the smoky hall\nand perched there in plain view, in the likeness of a swallow.\nAgelaos, Damastor’s son, was now urging the suitors on,\nwith Eurynomos, Amphimedon, Demoptolemos,\nPeisandros, Polyktor’s son, and skillful Polybos;\nfor these were by far the most valiant of the suitors\nwho were still alive and fighting for their survival: the pick\nof the rest had already fallen to the bow and constant arrows.\nAgelaos then spoke among them, addressing them all: “My friends,\nthis man by now must surely hold up his invincible hands!\nAfter all those empty boasts his friend Mentor’s deserted him,\nand they’re left by themselves there at the outer doorway!\nSo don’t now throw your long spears at them all together,\nbut you six throw first, see whether Zeus will maybe\ngrant that Odysseus be hit, and we win the glory—\nonce he’s fallen, there’s no need to worry about the others.”\nSo he spoke. They all threw their spears as he suggested,\nwith force; but Athene made all their efforts unsuccessful.\nOne of them hit a doorpost of the well-built feast hall,\na second the close-fitting door itself; another’s\nbronze-weighted ash spear ended up against the wall.\nSo when the suitors’ spears had missed them, much-enduring\nOdysseus at once addressed them, saying: “My friends,\nthis, I’d say, is the moment for us too now to hurl\nour own spears into the thick of these suitors, who are so eager\nto kill and strip us, on top of their earlier misdemeanors.”\nSo he spoke, and they all now threw their keen-edged spears\nwith careful aim. Odysseus hit Demoptolemos;\nTelemachos, Euryades; the swineherd, Elatos; while\nthe cowherd who cared for the cattle killed Peisandros.\nThese then all together bit the wide earth with their teeth,\nand the suitors retreated to the innermost part of the hall,\nwhile the others rushed forward and pulled their spears from the dead.\nThen once more the suitors threw their keen-edged spears\nwith force, but Athene made their efforts mostly unsuccessful.\none of them hit a doorpost of the well-built feast hall,\na second the close-fitting door itself; another’s\nbronze-weighted ash spear ended up against the wall.\nbut Amphimedon hit Telemachos on the arm at his wrist,\na glancing blow, the bronze scraping the surface of the skin,\nand Ktesippos with his long spear grazed Eumaios’ shoulder\nabove his shield, but the spear flew on, ended in the ground.\nThen once more those with the sharp and subtle-minded Odysseus\nflung their own keen-edged spears into the thick of the suitors,\nand once more Odysseus, city-sacker, scored a hit,\non Eurydamas; Telemachos on Amphimedon; the swineherd\non Polybos, while the herder of cattle struck Ktesippos\nsquare in the breast, and boasted over him, saying:\n“Polytherses’ son, insult-fancier, nevermore, ever, again\nthoughtlessly talk big, but leave any kind of comment\nto the gods, since they are far mightier! Here is a guest-gift\nfor you, a return for that ox hoof you lately presented\nto godlike Odysseus, on his begging round in the house.”\nSo spoke the crumple-horned cattle’s herder; but Odysseus\nnow wounded Damastor’s son with his long spear, close up,\nand Telemachos wounded Leokritos, Euenor’s son,\nwith a spear in the nether belly, drove the bronze through:\nhe fell prone, hitting the ground squarely with his forehead.\nThen Athene held up her aegis, the destroyer of mortals,\nfrom on high in the roof: the suitors were terrified,\nand stampeded through the hall like a herd of cows\nthat the darting gadfly descends on and drives to distraction\nin the season of spring, when the days are lengthening;\nand just as vultures, with crooked talons and hooked beaks,\ncome out from the mountains and swoop down on other birds,\nthat fly fast over the plain, and avoid the clouds, but still\nthe vultures pounce and destroy them: they have no defense\nor way of escape, and men enjoy watching the hunt—\nso now did they harry the suitors throughout the hall,\nstriking them right and left, and hideous cries went up\nas their heads were cracked, and the whole floor ran with blood.\nLeiodes rushed forward and clasped Odysseus’ knees\nand with winged words entreated him, saying: “I beg you\nby your knees, Odysseus, respect me and pity me! Never,\nI tell you, have I offended any woman here in your halls\nby improper word or deed: in fact I did my best\nto stop any other suitor who began to behave that way!\nBut they took no notice, wouldn’t restrain their hands from mischief,\nand through such wanton misconduct have met a ghastly fate.\nYet I, their soothsayer, who have done no wrong, will die\nalong with them: there’s no gratitude for benefits received!”\nWith an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n“If, as you claim, you in fact are their soothsayer, then surely\nmany times you’ll have made a prayer in my halls that the end\nof a sweet homecoming might be kept far from me, that you\nmight be the one with whom my dear wife went, bore children!\nFor that you won’t escape a most bitter death.”\nSo saying,\nhe seized in his sturdy hand a sword that lay nearby:\nAgelaos had dropped it at the moment when he was killed.\nWith this sword Odysseus now slashed through Leiodes’ neck.\nThe man was still speaking as his head rolled in the dust.\nTerpes’ son too, the minstrel, was still trying to avoid black fate—\nPhemios, who was compelled to perform among the suitors.\nHe now stood holding the clear-toned lyre in his hands,\nclose to the postern door, uncertain in his mind\nwhether to slip from the hall and sit at the well-built altar\nof Zeus of Enclosures, on which Laertes and Odysseus\nhad burnt in his honor so many thighs of oxen,\nor whether to run to Odysseus, entreat him at his knees.\nAnd as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\nto run up and clasp the knees of Laertes’ son Odysseus.\nSo he laid down his hollow lyre upon the floor\nbetween the mixing-bowl and his silver-studded chair,\nand himself ran forward and clasped Odysseus by the knees,\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “By your knees\nI entreat you, Odysseus! Respect me and pity me! On you\nhereafter shall sorrow be laid, if you choose to kill a minstrel\nsuch as I am, who performs for both gods and mankind!\nI am self-taught, but the god has planted in my heart\nlays of all kinds: I’m equipped to perform before you\nas I would for a god—so don’t be too ready to cut my throat!\nTelemachos too, your dear son, could testify to the fact\nthat it was against my will, with no desire on my part,\nthat I came to your house to sing for the suitors at their feasts—\nthey were stronger, and far more of them: they made me come.”\nSo he spoke. Telemachos, princely in power, heard him,\nand at once he addressed his nearby father, saying:\n“Whatever you do, don’t maim this innocent man with the bronze!\nLet’s also spare Medon the herald, who used to look after me\nhere in our house while I was still a child—that is,\nif Philoitios or the swineherd hasn’t already killed him,\nor he ran into you when you were storming through the house.”\nSo he spoke, and Medon, sagacious at heart, overheard him.\nHe’d ducked down under a chair, and wrapped himself in\nthe fresh-flayed hide of an ox, trying to avoid black fate.\nAt once he got up from the chair, quickly threw off the oxhide,\nrushed forward, clasped Telemachos by the knees,\nand uttering winged words then entreated him, saying:\n“Friend, here I am, it is I! Stay your hand, speak to your father,\nlest in his great strength he hurt me with the sharp bronze\nwhile incensed against these men, the suitors, who wasted\nhis goods here in his halls, and—the fools!—paid you no honor.”\nBut resourceful Odysseus smiled, and then addressed him, saying:\n“Relax! Telemachos here has protected you and saved you,\nso you may know in your heart, and pass the word to others,\nhow much better kind actions are than mean ones! But for now\nleave the feast hall, go sit down outside in the courtyard,\naway from the slaughter, you and the lay-rich minstrel,\nuntil I’ve finished the work I need to do here indoors.”\nSo he spoke. The two now went off, out of the feast hall,\nand sat themselves down by great Zeus’ altar, glancing\nin all directions, still half-expecting to be murdered.\nOdysseus too looked around, in his domain, to see whether\nany man, still alive, was hiding, in an effort to dodge black fate.\nBut what he saw was each one of them in the blood and dust—\nthe whole crowd, fallen, dead, like fish that fishermen\nhave drawn in their fine-meshed net up from the grey sea\nonto some crescent beach, and they all are lying there\nheaped up on the sand, sorely missing the waves of the sea;\nbut Helios, the bright sun, now heats the life out of them—\njust so the suitors all lay there, heaped up upon one another.\nResourceful Odysseus now addressed Telemachos, saying:\n“Telemachos, go and summon the nurse Eurykleia to me:\nThere’s something I have on my mind that I need to say to her.”\nSo he spoke, and Telemachos, in obedience to his father,\nwent and opened the door, and called to Eurykleia, saying:\n“Up with you now, old woman—you who are in charge\nof all the serving women we have in our hall—come here!\nMy father is calling for you, he wants to say something to you.”\nSo he spoke. Her own word remained unwinged: she opened\nthe doors of the well-built feast hall, and came out, Telemachos\nleading the way before her. She found Odysseus\nstanding amid the bodies of the men he had killed,\nbespattered with blood and gore, like a lion that’s come\nfrom the farmstead where it’s been feeding on an ox, and all\nits breast and its jowls on either side are beslobbered\nwith blood, so that it is a terrible sight to behold—\njust so was Odysseus bespattered, hands and feet alike.\nBut she, on beholding the corpses and the widespread bloodshed,\nbegan a cry of triumph, for the mighty deed she saw;\nbut Odysseus stopped her, cut short her enthusiasm,\nand uttering winged words, addressed her, saying:\n“Keep your joy to yourself, old woman—don’t exult aloud!\nIt’s not decent to vaunt over men that have been killed.\nThese dead were destroyed by divine fate and their own\ndastardly acts: they honored no mortals on this earth,\neither high or low, of those that came among them,\nand so through their wanton deeds they met a sorry end.\nNow tell me about the women in this household—both those\nwhose conduct dishonors me, and those that are innocent.”\nThen his dear nurse Eurykleia responded to him, saying:\n“Very well, my child: I’ll tell you the truth of the matter.\nFifty women there are that live here in your halls,\nhandmaids we taught to perform their various tasks,\ncarding the wool while enduring a lifetime of servitude:\nof these there are twelve who chose the path of shamelessness,\nshowing no respect for me or Penelope herself—\nTelemachos, though, only lately came of age: his mother\nhasn’t allowed him control over the women servants.\nBut now, please, let me go to that bright upper chamber\nand break the news to your wife, whom some god’s kept asleep.”\nTo her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n“No, don’t wake her yet. But go and tell those women\nwho’ve been guilty of shameful behavior to come in here, to me.”\nSo he spoke. The old woman went out through the hall\nto bring the women his message, and order them to come;\nwhile Odysseus summoned Telemachos, as well as the cowherd\nand swineherd, and addressed them with winged words, saying:\n“Start removing the corpses now. Get the women to help you.\nThen have them clean off these elegant chairs and tables,\nwashing them down with water, using porous sponges.\nWhen you’ve put the whole hall in proper order, then\ntake these maidservants out of the well-built hall, to a spot\nmidway between the round house and the courtyard’s flawless wall,\nand cut them up with your long sharp swords till you’ve taken\nthe life from them all and they’ve forgotten their Aphrodisiac\npleasures under the suitors, lying with them clandestinely.”\nAs he spoke, the women arrived in a body, all sobbing\ndesperately, all shedding big tears. So first of all\nthey bore out the bodies of the slain, and stacked them\nunder the colonnade of the well-walled courtyard,\npropped up against one another, while Odysseus directed\ntheir work himself, hurrying them. They were forced to carry\nthe corpses. Then they cleaned off the elegant chairs and tables,\nwashing them down with water, using porous sponges.\nTelemachos meanwhile, with the cowherd and the swineherd,\nscraped off the floor of the close-built house with shovels,\nand the women collected the scrapings, deposited them outside.\nThen, when they’d put the whole hall in proper order,\nthey took the maidservants out of that well-built hall, to a spot\nmidway between the round house and the courtyard’s flawless wall,\nand shut them in a tight corner, with no possible escape.\nSagacious Telemachos now spoke first to the others, saying:\n“A clean death isn’t the way by which I want to end\nthese women’s lives: they poured insults on my own head\nand my mother’s too, all while they were sleeping with the suitors.”\nSo he spoke, and taking the cable of a dark-prowed vessel,\nhitched one end to a tall pillar, the other about the round house,\nstretching it high, so no woman could touch the ground with her feet.\nAs when long-winged thrushes or doves are caught in the snare\nthat’s been set for them in a thicket, as they’re flying back\nto their roosts, and hateful the bed that now welcomes them,\nthese women’s heads bobbed in a line, and round their necks\nnooses were set for all, to give them most piteous deaths:\nthey jerked with their feet a little, but not for long.\nThen they brought Melanthios out, through the forecourt and yard,\nand cut off his nose and ears with the pitiless bronze,\nand ripped out his private parts for the dogs to eat raw,\nand in their fury chopped off his hands and his feet.\nThat done, they washed their own hands and feet, and went\ninto the house to Odysseus, and their work was over.\nBut he now addressed his dear nurse Eurykleia, saying:\n“Bring sulfur, old woman, that cleanses pollution, and bring me\nfire, to make fumes that will purge the hall; then tell\nPenelope to come down now, she and her handmaids,\nand have all the women servants in the house assemble here.”\nThen his dear nurse Eurykleia responded to him, saying:\n“Yes indeed, my child, all this you’ve requested is in order.\nBut please, let me bring you a mantle and tunic to wear—\ndon’t stand like that in your hall with your broad shoulders\nclad only in rags: that would be just cause for censure.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n“First of all, see that a fire is lit for me in the hall.”\nSo he spoke; and his dear nurse Eurykleia did not\ndisregard him, but fetched fire and sulfur; and Odysseus\nthoroughly purified hall and house and courtyard. Then\nthe old woman went back through Odysseus’ fine domain\nto bring word to the women, and order them to assemble;\nand out they came from their quarters, torches in their hands,\nand crowded round Odysseus, and embraced him,\nand clasped and kissed his head and his hands and shoulders\nin affectionate greeting, and a sweet longing possessed him\nfor crying and tears: each one of them was familiar to him.\n",

         "\nChuckling, the old woman ascended to the upper chamber,\nto bring her mistress the news that her dear husband was there,\nin the house: her feet hobbled, but her knees moved briskly,\nand she stood at Penelope’s head, and addressed her, saying:\n“Wake up, Penelope, dear child, so you may see\nwith your own eyes what you’ve longed for all this time!\nOdysseus is here, back at last, late though his return!\nHe’s slaughtered the haughty suitors who were preying on\nhis household, devouring his property, bullying his son!”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to her, saying:\n“Dear granny, the gods have crazed you—those who are able\nto change even the sharpest-witted into a nitwit, or take\na halfwit and set him well on the road to wisdom!\nIt’s they who’ve crazed you—you, who were once so sensible!\nWhy do you mock me thus, when my heart’s full of sorrow,\ntalking in that wild way, arousing me from sleep—\nsweet sleep, that bound me fast, enfolded my eyelids? Never\nhave I slept so soundly since that day when Odysseus\nleft to set eyes on ill Ilion—that unspeakable name!\nOff with you now, back down to the women’s quarters—\nand if any other woman, of all those who belong to me,\nhad come to me with this story, and woken me up, for sure\nI’d have quickly sent her packing, back downstairs,\nin a way she’d regret! But here your old age shall save you.”\nEurykleia, loyal nurse, then responded to her, saying:\n“Dear child, I’m not mocking you! What I said is the truth!\nOdysseus is here, back home, exactly as I informed you:\nthe stranger that all the men were insulting in the feast hall—\nthat’s him! Telemachos learned who he was a while back,\nbut he was discreet, kept his father’s plans well hidden\ntill he could punish the violence of these overbearing men.”\nSo she spoke. Rejoicing, Penelope sprang from her bed,\nand hugged the old woman, shedding tears from her eyelids,\nand, uttering winged words, addressed her, saying:\n“Come now, dear granny, please will you tell me truly,\nif he’s in fact come back home, as you say, how he contrived\nto lay hands on this crowd of shameless suitors—alone,\nwhile they always stay together when they’re in this house.”\nEurykleia, loyal nurse, then responded to her, saying:\n“I neither saw nor was told of it. I only heard the groaning\nof men being killed. We sat, terrified, at the back\nof our well-built quarters, behind the close-fitting doors,\nuntil your son came in from the hall and called us—\nhis father had sent Telemachos over to fetch us out.\nI found Odysseus standing among the slaughtered corpses:\nthey lay all around him, filled the hard-trodden floor,\nheaped on each other. To see him would have warmed your heart—\nall bespattered with blood and gore, like a lion, he was!\nAll the bodies are now collected at the gates of the courtyard,\nin one pile, and he’s purifying his fine home with sulfur,\nafter kindling a large fire. He’s sent me to summon you.\nSo come, that the hearts of you both may enter upon\ntrue happiness, after all the troubles that you’ve endured!\nNow at long last what you hoped for has been fulfilled:\nhe’s come back himself, alive, to his own hearth, and found\nboth you and his son in his halls. As for those who mistreated him,\nthe suitors, he’s been revenged on all of them in his house!”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to her, saying: “Dear granny,\ndon’t laugh out loud, don’t exult in triumph over them yet:\nyou know how welcome his appearance here in these halls\nwould be to us all, but most to me, and the son born to us.\nBut this is no true account, the way you tell it: no,\nsome immortal’s slaughtered the haughty suitors, in wrath\nat their heartbreaking wantonness and their wicked deeds;\nfor they had no respect for any dwellers upon this earth\nwhether high or low, whoever might come among them;\nso they’ve come to grief through their own mad folly. But Odysseus\nhas lost, far away, his return to Achaia—and his life.”\nEurykleia, loyal nurse, then responded to her, saying:\n“My child, what’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth,\nsaying your husband—who’s here, by the hearth downstairs!—\nwill never return home? Your heart’s always so mistrustful!\nLook, here’s another clear proof that I’ll now tell you: the scar\nfrom that wound the white tusk of a boar dealt him long ago:\nI saw it while washing his feet, and wanted to break the news\nto you yourself, but he put his hand over my mouth\nand in his great shrewdness of mind wouldn’t let me tell you.\nSo come with me now, and I’ll put my own life at hazard:\nif I’m deceiving you, kill me, in the most painful manner!”\nTo her prudent Penelope responded, saying: “Dear granny,\nit’s hard for you to fathom the thoughts of the gods\neternal, however intelligent you may be. Even so,\nlet’s go down and join my son, for me to see these men,\nthe suitors, dead, and whoever it was that killed them.”\nSo saying, she set off downstairs, debating in her heart\nwhether to keep at a distance from—her own dear husband?\nor rather go to him, clasp his head and hands and kiss them?\nBut when she’d come in, passing over the stone threshold,\nshe sat down facing Odysseus, in the light from the fire,\nby the opposite wall. He was sitting against a tall pillar,\nlooking down, and waiting to see if his comely bedfellow\nwould make any comment when she’d had a good look at him.\nBut she sat long in silence, heart possessed by wonder,\nnow with her eyes scrutinizing his face intensely,\nthen failing to recognize him in the mean rags he wore.\nTelemachos took her to task, and addressed her, saying:\n“Mother, my cruel mother, so unyielding at heart,\nwhy do you thus hold back from my father? Why not sit\nbeside him, interrogate him, ask him questions?\nNo other woman would thus, with obdurate heart,\nhold aloof from a husband who, much hardship suffered,\nhad, in the twentieth year, come back to his own country;\nbut your heart is always harder than any stone.”\nTo him\nPrudent Penelope now responded, saying: “My child,\nthe heart in my breast is lost in wonder, I cannot\nfind words with which to address or question him,\nor look him straight in the face. But if in actual truth\nhe’s Odysseus, come back home, then undoubtedly we two\npossess better ways of recognizing each other:\nsigns known only to us—no one else has access to them.”\nSo she spoke. Noble much-enduring Odysseus smiled,\nand at once addressed Telemachos with winged words, saying:\n“Telemachos, let your mother now make trial of me here,\nin my own domain: soon enough she’ll understand much better.\nBut at present, because I’m filthy, and clad in mean clothing,\nshe treats me with disrespect, won’t yet say I am he.\nFor now, we need to consider how best to settle matters.\nA man who’s killed only a single soul in his district,\neven one without many to avenge him when he’s gone,\nstill flees into exile, abandoning kin and country;\nbut we’ve slain the city’s mainstay, the very noblest\nof the youths on Ithake: this you need to bear in mind.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Look to it yourself, dear father: they say yours is the best\ncounsel of all mankind, that there’s no other mortal,\nnot one living person, that could compete with you!\nAs for us, we’ll follow you eagerly, and I don’t think\nwe’ll fall short in prowess, insofar as we have the power.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“So, I shall tell you the best course as I see it.\nFirst all go and wash yourselves, then put on tunics,\nand tell the maids in their quarters to choose their dresses,\nand let the godlike minstrel with his clear-toned lyre\nact as our leader in the pleasures of dancing,\nso that any person outside who hears the sounds—\na neighbor or passerby—will assume it’s a wedding-feast.\nThat way the news of the slaughter of these suitors\nwon’t spread abroad through the district before we’ve gone\nout to our wooded farmstead, where we can then\nestablish whatever advantage the Olympian may grant us.”\nSo he spoke. They all were listening, and readily obeyed him.\nFirst they went and washed and put on their tunics,\nand the women decked themselves out, and the godlike minstrel\ntook up his hollow lyre, and aroused a longing in them\nfor the pleasures of song and fine dancing. So the great hall\nresounded all about with the noise made by the feet\nof dancing men, and well-dressed women, and thus\nmight a person outside the house who heard them declare:\n“For sure, someone must have married the much-wooed queen!\nHard-hearted she was, had no stomach to keep her wedded\nhusband’s domain right through, until he returned.”\nSo they’d say,\nbut knew nothing of the events that had in fact taken place.\nSo now great-hearted Odysseus was washed in his own house\nby his housekeeper, Eurynome: she massaged him with oil,\nand dressed him in an elegant mantle and a tunic,\nwhile over his body Athene shed an abundance of beauty,\nmaking him taller and sturdier, and from his pate\nshe conjured hair, thick and curling, like the hyacinth blossom.\nAs happens when some craftsman overlays silver with gold—\nan expert, to whom Hephaistos and Pallas Athene have taught\nevery kind of technique, to embellish the works he creates—\nso she now shed grace over his head and shoulders,\nand he came from the bath in appearance like the immortals,\nand sat down again on the chair from which he’d risen,\nfacing his wife; and he then addressed her, saying:\n“Strange lady, to you, beyond all womankind, those\nwho make their home on Olympos have given a stubborn spirit!\nNo other woman would thus, with obdurate heart\nhold aloof from the husband who, much hardship suffered,\nhad, in the twentieth year, come back to his own country!\nWell, granny, spread me a bed, so that I can settle down\nhere by myself, for the heart in her breast is of iron.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Strange sir, I’m being neither haughty nor indifferent,\nnor am I oversurprised. I know well what you looked like\nwhen you sailed from Ithake in that long-oared ship of yours.\nCome then, Eurykleia, make up the solid bedstead for him,\noutside the well-built bedroom that he himself constructed!\nThere set the solid bedstead, and put bedding on it—\nfleeces, blankets, bright coverlets.”\nSo she spoke,\nmaking trial of her husband. But Odysseus in response\nburst out in anger, and addressed his true wife, saying:\n“Woman, this word you’ve said embitters my heart!\nWho’s moved my bed elsewhere? A hard job that would be,\neven for a skilled worker, unless some god came down\nin person, and chose to shift it: easy enough for him!\nBut of mortals no man alive, however young and strong,\ncould dislodge it, for a great token was embodied\nin the bed that I fashioned—I, and no other man! There was\na small long-leafed olive-tree that grew there in the courtyard,\nflourishing, in its prime. Its girth was like a pillar.\nRound this I built our chamber, till it was finished,\nwith close-set stones, and a sound roof overhead,\nand dovetailed doors I added, made to fit closely; then\nI lopped off the foliage of the long-leafed olive, trimmed\nthe trunk from the root up, made it smooth it with a bronze\nadze, well and expertly, shaped it true to the line,\nmaking it into a bedpost, bored holes in it with my auger.\nBeginning with that, I worked till I’d finished the whole bed,\nadorned it with inlays—gold, silver, ivory—then latticed\nthe bed frame with thongs of oxhide, dyed bright purple.\nThus I describe this token to you—though I’ve no idea\nif this bed of mine’s still in place, wife, or whether by now\nsome man’s severed the olive’s trunk, and moved it elsewhere.”\nSo he spoke. Her knees and heart were undone on the spot,\nsince well she knew the sure tokens that Odysseus had described.\nThen she ran straight to him in tears, and flung her arms\nabout his neck, kissed his face, and addressed him, saying:\n“Don’t be angry with me, Odysseus! In all other matters\nyou’ve been the wisest of men—the gods it was brought us grief,\nbegrudging that we two should remain one with the other,\nenjoy our joint life together from youth to the brink of old age.\nBut please don’t now get cross or take me to task because\nat first sight I didn’t, as now, give you a loving welcome!\nThe heart in my breast was always terrified lest some man\nmight turn up here, beguile me with his specious story—\nmany there are who scheme for their own low profit!\nNot even Argive Helen, Zeus’ progeny, would have coupled\nin love and bed with that foreigner had she but known\nthe Achaians’ warlike sons were going to fetch her back\nto her own home and country. In her case a god\nincited her to commit her improper act: not till then\ndid she put in her mind that ghastly act of mad folly,\nthat first brought such grief upon us as well. But now—\nsince you’ve already recounted, clear and plain, the tokens\nof this bed of ours, seen by no other living mortal\nexcept you and me alone, and one solitary handmaid,\nAktor’s daughter, a gift from my father, before I came here,\nthe doorkeeper of our close-built bridal chamber now—\nyou’ve convinced my heart, all too stubborn though it was.”\nSo she spoke, and stirred in his heart yet more the urge to cry,\nand he wept as he held in his arms his loyal beloved wife,\nand welcome as is the appearance of dry land to men swimming,\nmen whose strong ship Poseidon has wrecked out on the deep,\nas it’s driven on by the gale and the cresting waves,\nand few have made it to land out of the grey salt sea\nby swimming, and thick is the brine that’s crusted on their bodies,\nand glad they are to have got ashore, and escaped disaster—\nso welcome to her was her husband as she looked upon him,\nnever relaxing the hold of her white arms round his neck.\nIndeed, rosy-fingered Dawn would have risen while they wept\nhad the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, not planned things otherwise.\nThe night’s last stage she prolonged, while holding up\ngolden-throned Dawn at Ocean, and not permitting her\nto yoke up her swift-footed horses, bringing light to mankind—\nPhaethon and Lampos, the colts that draw Dawn’s chariot.\nThen resourceful Odysseus addressed his wife, saying: “Not yet\nhave we reached the conclusion, my wife, of all our trials:\nthere’s a measureless task still awaiting us in the future,\nboth long and hard: I need to accomplish this in full.\nThat’s what the ghost of Teiresias prophesied to me\non the day I ventured down into the realm of Hades\nto enquire about my comrades’ homecoming, and my own.\nBut come, my wife, let’s to bed, so that now, at last, soothed\nby sweet sleep, we may find our joy and comfort together.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Your bed shall be ready for you whenever your heart\nis so inclined, now the gods have managed your return\nto your well-built home, and to your native country:\nbut since you’ve thought of this, and a god’s put it in your mind,\ntell me what this trial is—I fancy I’ll learn its nature\nsoon enough: no bad thing to know of it in advance.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“Strange lady, why do you now so urgently want me\nto tell you this? Well, I’ll do so, I’ll keep nothing secret.\nBut your heart will get no joy of it, nor am I myself\nhappy about it. Teiresias said I must travel to numerous\ncities of men, while holding a well-shaped oar in my hands,\nuntil I come among men who know nothing of the sea,\nwho eat their food without flavoring it with salt\nand have never set eyes on ships with purple cheeks\nor on the well-shaped oars that serve as a ship’s wings;\nand he told me a manifest sign, one that wouldn’t escape me:\nwhen on the road I encounter another man who believes\nwhat I have on my sturdy shoulder is a winnowing-fan,\nI’m to fix my well-shaped oar on end in the ground,\nand offer a lavish sacrifice to the lord Poseidon—\na ram, a bull, and a stud boar that mounts its sows.\nI then must come back home, make rich sacred offerings\nto the immortal gods who possess broad heaven,\nin due order. Death will come to me from the sea,\nthe gentlest of ends, that will take me only when\nI’ve worn out a sleek old age, with my people round me\nprospering. All of this, he told me, would come to pass.”\nPrudent Penelope then responded to him, saying:\n“If indeed the gods are allowing you a better old age,\nthen there’s hope that we’ll get a chance to escape our troubles.”\nSuch was the conversation between them. All this while\nthe nurse and Eurynome were making up their bed\nwith soft bedclothes, under the light of flaming torches;\nand when they’d hastily readied the solid bedstead,\nthe old nurse went off to sleep in her own quarters,\nwhile Eurynome, maid of the bedchamber, conducted them\non their way to bed, holding a torch on her hand.\nAfter escorting them there she too retired, while they\nhappily rediscovered the world of their old-time bed.\nTelemachos and the cowherd and the swineherd now\nstopped their feet from dancing, stopped the women too,\nand lay down to sleep themselves, in the shadowy halls.\nWhen the couple had had their fill of passionate lovemaking,\nthey got pleasure from conversation, chatting to one another.\nShe, bright among women, told of all she’d borne in the halls,\nhaving to watch the destructive crowd of suitors, those who,\nwith her as excuse, had slaughtered many cattle and fat sheep,\nwhile too much wine was drawn from the storage jars; while he,\nZeus-born Odysseus, recounted all the woes he’d inflicted\non others, and all he’d endured with pain himself;\nand she heard him out with delight, and sweet sleep never\nwas shed on her eyelids until his whole tale was told.\nHe began with how he’d first overcome the Kikones,\nthen came to the rich terrain of the lotus-eating men;\nand all that the Kyklops did, and the price he made him pay\nfor those of his sturdy comrades he’d pitilessly devoured;\nand then how he came to Aiolos, who readily welcomed him,\nand gave him conveyance—but he was not yet fated to reach\nhis own land: once again the storm wind snatched him up\nand bore him, heavily groaning, over the fish-rich deep;\nthen how he’d come to Telepylos, where the Laistrygonians\ndestroyed his ships and all his well-greaved comrades,\nOdysseus alone escaping in his black ship. He next\nrecounted all of Kirke’s deceits and contrivances,\nhow he’d gone in his many-oared ship to Hades’ dank domain,\nto consult the spirit of Theban Teiresias; and how\nthere he’d seen every one of his former companions,\nbesides the mother who bore him, and nursed him as a child;\nhow he’d heard the voice of the Sirens, unceasing singers;\nhow he’d come to the Wandering Rocks, and to dread Charybdis\nand Skylle, from whom till then no man had escaped unscathed;\nand how his comrades had slaughtered the cattle of Helios;\nand how his swift ship had been struck by a smoldering bolt\nfrom high-thundering Zeus, and his fine comrades died together,\nall of them: he alone got clear of the grim death spirits;\nhow he came to the isle of Ogygia and the nymph Kalypso,\nwho kept him there, longing to have him as her husband,\nin her hollow caves, and looked after him, and declared\nshe would make him immortal and ageless all his days,\nyet never could win over the heart in his breast; and how\nafter many hardships endured he reached the Phaiakians,\nwho treated him with high honor, as though he were a god,\nand conveyed him home in a ship to his native country\nwith presents of bronze and gold and apparel. This concluded\nthe tale as he told it and was when sweet limb-loosening\nsleep sprang on him, dissolving his heart’s anxieties.\nThe grey-eyed goddess Athene now had another idea.\nWhen she figured Odysseus had had his fill of pleasure\nfrom bedding his wife and sleeping, she at once aroused\nfrom Ocean the Dawn, early risen and golden-throned,\nto bring light to mankind; and now Odysseus arose\nfrom his soft bed, and gave a charge to Penelope, saying:\n“My wife, by now we’ve had a surfeit of endless trials,\nboth of us, you here weeping over my troubled homecoming,\nwhile Zeus and the other deities hobbled me with hardships\nfar from my own country, though I longed to be back!\nBut now we’ve come at last to the marriage bed we yearned for,\nyou’ll care for such possessions as I have here in the halls;\nand as for the flocks that these haughty suitors have wasted,\nI’ll get a good many by raiding, and others that the Achaians\nwill give me, until we’ve replenished every last empty stall!\nMy first task now is to visit my wooded farmstead and see\nmy sturdy old father, who’s so distressed on my account.\nAnd on you, wife, I lay this charge, as a sensible woman:\nBeginning at sunrise the word will very soon get around\nconcerning these men, the suitors, whom I slew in our halls;\nso both you and your women servants must go upstairs\nto your chamber and sit there: no peeping, don’t ask questions.”\nThat said, he arranged his fine armor about his shoulders,\nwoke up Telemachos and the cowherd and the swineherd,\nand ordered them all to lay hands on their war gear. They\ndid not disregard him, but donned their bronze body armor,\nand opened the doors and went out, with Odysseus leading.\nLight already was over the earth, but Athene concealed them\nin darkness, and led them out quickly from the city.\n",

         "\nHermes, god of Kyllene, now summoned forth the ghosts\nof the men who’d been suitors: he held the staff in his hands—\nexquisite, golden—with which he bemuses the eyes\nof those he wishes, while others he conjures out of their sleep.\nThis he used to herd and to lead them: they followed him, squeaking.\nAs in the furthest recesses of some vast cave the bats\nflit about squeaking when one of them falls down the rock face\nfrom the chain they form, clinging closely one to another,\nso these went along with him, squeaking. Hermes the healer\nconducted them down dank and moldering pathways:\nby the streams of Ocean they went, and the White Rock,\nthey went by the gates of the sun and the region of dreams,\nand quickly they now arrived at the meadow of asphodels,\nwhere ghosts dwell, the shades of those whose toils are over.\nThere they found the ghost of Peleus’ son Achilles,\nand those of Patroklos and of peerless Antilochos,\nand of Aias, unmatched for handsomeness and stature\namong all the Danaans, save for Peleus’ peerless son.\nSo these gathered round Achilles. Close to them now\nthere came the ghost of Atreus’ son Agamemnon,\ngrieving; and round him clustered the ghosts of all those\nwho’d died and met their fate with him in Aigisthos’ house;\nand the first ghost to address him was the son of Peleus, saying:\n“Son of Atreus, we had this belief that Zeus, the hurler of bolts,\nloved you above other heroes, for all your days, because\nyou were lord over many brave men out there in the land\nof the Trojans, where we Achaians suffered much hardship.\nYet on you as well there was fated to come too early\nthat deadly destiny which no mortal born can avoid—\nWould that, while still enjoying your royal power,\nyou’d encountered your death and fate in Trojan country!\n“Then all the Achaians would have made you a burial mound,\nand great glory would have been yours, and your son’s, hereafter,\nwhereas now you’ve been doomed to suffer a most piteous death.”\nThen the ghost of the son of Atreus responded to him, saying:\n“Ah, fortunate son of Peleus, godlike Achilles: you died\nout at Troy, far from Argos, and around you others were slain,\nthe finest sons of the Trojans and the Achaians,\nfighting over your body; amid the swirling dust\ngreat in your greatness you lay, your horsemanship forgotten.\nThat whole day we battled; we’d never have quit fighting\nhad Zeus not unleashed a hurricane, and stopped us.\nBut when we’d carried you out of the battle to the ships,\nwe laid you on a litter, and cleansed your splendid body\nwith warm water and unguents, and the Danaans shed\nmany warm tears over you, cut off locks of their hair.\nYour mother came up from the sea with her immortal sea nymphs\nwhen she heard the news: a cry echoed over the deep,\na strange cry, and panic now seized on all the Achaians:\nthey’d have taken off and run for it, back to the hollow ships,\nhad they not been checked by a man versed in ancient wisdom—\nNestor: even before this his counsel had seemed the best.\nHe with friendly intent now addressed the assembly, saying:\n‘Stop this, you Argives! Don’t flee, you Achaian youths!\nIt’s his mother, come from the sea with her immortal sea nymphs\nin her concern for the death of her own son.’\n“So he spoke,\nand the great-hearted Achaians abandoned their panic flight.\nRound you gathered the daughters of the Old Man of the Sea\nlamenting piteously, wrapped you in ambrosial clothing;\nall the Nine Muses with their sweet antiphonal voices\nnow led the dirge—there wasn’t a single tearless Argive\nto be seen, so deeply did the clear-toned Muse affect them.\nSo for seventeen days, by night as well as by day,\nwe mourned you, immortal gods and mortal men together;\nthen on the eighteenth we surrendered you to the fire,\nand many fat sheep and crumple-horned oxen we slaughtered\naround you; you were burned in the gods’ own clothing\nwith a wealth of sweet honey and unguents: many Achaian heroes\nfooted it round the pyre in their war gear while you burned,\nfoot soldiers and horsemen both: a great clamor arose.\nBut when Hephaistos’ flames had finished their work,\nat dawn we collected your white bones, Achilles,\nin unmixed wine and fine oil. Your mother had given us\na golden two-handled jar: a present from Dionysos,\nshe said, and the work of renowned Hephaistos. In this\nyour white bones now lie, illustrious Achilles,\nmingled with those of dead Patroklos, Menoitios’ son;\nseparate are those of Antilochos, whom you honored\nabove all your comrades, save only dead Patroklos. Over them\nwe heaped up a huge and matchless burial mound—\nwe, the sacred army of Argive spearmen—on\na prominent headland by the broad Hellespont,\nto be visible far out at sea both to men now living\nand those yet unborn hereafter. And your mother\nsought and obtained from the gods most exquisite prizes\nand set them in mid-arena to be won by the best Achaians.\nBefore now you’ve been present at the funeral games of many\nheroes, when on the occasion of a king’s demise\nyoung men gird themselves up and prepare to compete\nfor prizes; had you seen these ones you’d have been astounded\nby the sheer beauty of the prizes the goddess, silver-footed\nThetis, set up in your honor: most dear to the gods you were!\nSo not even in death did you lose your name, but forever\nyour noble renown, Achilles, shall be known to all mankind.\nBut what pleasure had I from this—that I wound up the war?\nFor on my return Zeus contrived me a most miserable end,\nat the hands of Aigisthos and my accursed wife.”\nSuch was the conversation between them, one to the other.\nThe Escort, the slayer of Argos, now approached them,\nleading down the ghosts of those suitors whom Odysseus had killed;\nThe two, amazed by the sight, went straight to meet them.\nThe ghost of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, recognized\nMelaneus’ dear son, far-famed Amphimedon, who\nhad his home on Ithake, and whose guest-friend he’d once been.\nAtreus’ son was the first to speak, and addressed him, saying:\n“Amphimedon, what befell you, all picked men of like age,\nto bring you here, down below the dark earth? Not otherwise\nwould one make one’s list if selecting the best men in the city!\nWas it Poseidon destroyed you aboard your vessels\nby stirring up the dread blast of hard-blowing gales?\nOr did hostile men work your destruction on dry land\nwhen you were lifting their cattle and fine fleecy sheep\nor fighting them for their city and for their women?\nAnswer my question! I declare that I’m your guest-friend—\nDon’t you recall the time I came there to your house\nwith godlike Menelaos, to persuade Odysseus\nto accompany us to Ilion on the well-benched ships?\nA whole month the journey took us, crossing the broad deep,\nfor hard it was to persuade Odysseus the city-sacker.”\nThen the ghost of Amphimedon responded to him, saying:\n“Most glorious son of Atreus, Agamemnon, king of men,\nI recall these events, Zeus’ nursling, just as you recount them;\nand now I in turn shall tell you, truthfully and in full,\nwhat led to our nasty death, how the whole thing happened.\nWe were courting the wife of the long-absent Odysseus:\nshe neither rejected nor made this marriage that she hated,\nbut—while planning death and black fate for us—\nprivately conceived this other trick in her mind.\nIn her halls she set up a great loom, and started weaving—\nvery broad was the web, fine of thread—and said to us then:\n‘You young men, my suitors now noble Odysseus is dead,\nbe patient, though eager to wed me, until I finish\nthis web: I should not want my woven work to be wasted—\na shroud for the hero Laertes, against that day\nwhen the grim fate of pitiless death shall overtake him:\nthen the local Achaian women won’t be able to blame me\nfor a man who’d won so much being left with no winding-sheet.’\n“So she spoke; our proud hearts assented to what she said.\nFrom then on, day after day, she’d be weaving at the great loom,\nbut at night she’d have torches set up, and undo her work.\nThus for three years she beguiled and persuaded the Achaians;\nbut when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round,\nand the months wore away, and day after day passed by,\nthen one of her women, who knew the truth, informed us,\nand we caught her undoing her work at that splendid loom.\nSo she finished it off perforce, though against her will,\nand showed it to us when she’d woven it on the great web\nand washed it: it shone like the sun or the moon. It was then\nthat some evil spirit brought Odysseus from who knows where\nto the border of his estate, where the swineherd lived.\nThither too there came the dear son of godlike Odysseus,\non his way back in his black ship from sandy Pylos;\nand the two of them, after planning a nasty death for the suitors,\nreturned to the famous town, Odysseus later,\nbut Telemachos going on ahead of him. Now the swineherd\nbrought in Odysseus, meanly garbed, and made\nto look like a miserable beggar, of a great age\nand propped on a staff. The clothes he wore were ragged.\nNo man among us, not even the older ones, when he\nappeared out of nowhere could tell who he really was:\nwe all assailed him with insults, threw things at him.\nHe for a while, set firm in his purpose, put up\nwith being pelted and taunted there his own domain;\nbut when the intent of Zeus of the aegis stirred him,\nwith Telemachos’ help he removed all the first-class war gear,\nstowed it away in a storeroom and bolted the door.\nThen, in his crafty planning, he instructed his wife to set\nbefore the suitors his bow and the grey iron, as a contest—\nand the beginning of death—for us ill-fated men.\nNot one of us was able to draw and notch the string\nof his powerful bow: we all fell far short of that.\nBut when the great bow was passed into Odysseus’ hands,\nthen we all of us made a great outcry, shouted aloud\nnot to give him the bow, whatever he might say.\nOnly Telemachos urged him on, and told him to try it.\nSo the noble much-enduring Odysseus grasped the bow,\nand easily strung it, and sent an arrow through the iron.\nThen he went and stood on the threshold, and emptied out\nhis swift shafts, glancing round fiercely, and shot the prince\nAntinoos, then let fly at the others his hurtful arrows,\ntaking sure aim. The men fell thick and fast, and now\nit became very clear that some god was his helper,\nfor suddenly sallying forth they raged from room to room\nkilling men on all sides, and a ghastly clamor went up\nas heads were stove in, and the whole floor ran with blood.\nSo we all died, Agamemnon; and even now our bodies\nare still lying there, uncared-for, in the halls of Odysseus,\nsince the dear ones in each man’s home as yet know nothing of it—\nthose who’d wash the black gore away from our wounds,\nand lay us out, keening: the proper privilege of the dead.”\nThen the ghost of the son of Atreus responded to him, saying:\n“Ah, fortunate son of Laertes, resourceful Odysseus!\nTruly endowed with great virtue was the bedfellow you won!\nHow excellent was the mind-set of Ikarios’ daughter,\nblameless Penelope, how well she remembered Odysseus,\nher wedded husband! And so the renown of her great virtue\nshall never perish, because the immortals shall make a charming\nsong for men here on earth, about constant Penelope!\nNot such was Tyndareus’ daughter, who did a wicked deed,\nkilling her wedded husband: loathsome the song about her\nleft to posterity, and vile the repute she bequeathed\nto all womankind, even those who conduct was virtuous.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another,\nstanding in Hades’ domain, deep down below the earth.\nThe others now, leaving the city, soon arrived at Laertes’\nfarmstead, fine and well-cultivated, which he’d acquired\nlong ago, and heavy the labor that he’d expended on it.\nThis was his home. All round it ran the outhouses in which\nthere ate, sat, and slept those who were his servants\nout of necessity, working at whatever he wanted. Inside\nthe house lived an old Sikel woman, who took good care\nof the old man himself, on his farmstead, far from the city.\nOdysseus addressed his servants and son, saying: “You go now\ninto his well-built house, and quickly choose and slaughter\nfor dinner the very best of the hogs; but as for me,\nI mean to make trial of my father, find out whether he\nwill recognize me, know who I am when he sees me,\nor fail to know me, since I’ve been away so long.”\nSo saying, he handed over his war gear to his servants.\nThey then hastened into the house, but Odysseus\nwent off to the flourishing vineyard to carry out his test.\nAs he entered the large orchard he did not find Dolios,\nor any of his slaves or his sons: they’d all gone off\ncollecting stones to make a wall for the vineyard,\nwith the old man leading the way. Instead he found\nhis father alone in the well-constructed vineyard,\ndigging around a plant, in a filthy tunic,\npatched and shabby, and round his shins he’d fastened\nstitched leggings of oxhide, to stop him getting scratched,\nwith gloves on his hands against the thorns, and above them\non his head a goatskin cap—all fostering his sorrow.\nWhen much-enduring noble Odysseus saw him thus,\nworn out by old age, and with great grief in his heart,\nstanding below a tall pear tree he shed tears, as he\ndebated in mind and heart what it was he should do next:\nshould he kiss and embrace his father, tell him all\nabout how he’d returned, come back to his own country;\nor should he first ask him questions, test him on details?\nAnd as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\nto make trial of him to begin with, use bantering language.\nWith this in mind noble Odysseus went directly to him.\nLaertes, head down, was still digging around the plant:\nhis illustrious son came up and addressed him, saying:\n“Old man, you’ve no lack of skill, the way you tend this orchard!\nYou take good care of it all, there isn’t one thing here—\nplant or fig tree, vine, pear tree, olive, or even\nthe vegetable plot—that lacks proper cultivation!\nBut I do have to tell you, and please don’t take offense:\nyour person is not well cared for: you endure a wretched\nold age, you’re unpleasantly filthy, you wear foul clothes.\nWhy doesn’t your master look after you? Not, clearly, because\nyou’re idle! There’s nothing slavish about your appearance,\nin bearing or stature: you’re like a man who’s a king—\nthe kind of person who, when he’s bathed and eaten,\nshould sleep soft. And that’s the proper way for the old!\nNow come, tell me this, and answer me truthfully:\nWhat man’s servant are you? Whose orchard is this you tend?\nAnd tell me this truly also, so I may be certain:\nIs this really Ithake I’ve come to, as a man informed me\nwhom I encountered just now as I made my way here?\nHe wasn’t very clear-headed: he didn’t manage to tell me\nany particulars, or listen to what I said when I asked him\nabout a guest-friend of mine: does he still live, exist?\nOr is he dead already, and in Hades’ domain? I shall\nspeak plainly to you: pay attention and hear me out!\nI once, in my own country, entertained a man\nwho’d come to our house, and no other mortal yet\nof all remote-dwelling strangers was more welcome there.\nBy descent he was, he said, from Ithake: he told me\nhis own father was Laertes, the son of Arkeisios.\nI escorted him to our house, and welcomed him properly\nwith full entertainment from our rich household store;\nand I offered him gifts of guest-friendship, such as are fitting—\nof fine-wrought gold I bestowed on him seven talents,\nand a mixing-bowl all of silver, adorned with flowers,\na dozen plain cloaks, the same number of rugs and blankets,\nand as many beautiful mantles, with matching tunics;\nwomen I also gave him, skilled in fine handiwork,\nfour of them, very attractive, the ones he fancied himself.”\nThen his father responded to him, shedding tears:\n“Stranger, indeed you’ve come to the land about which you ask;\nbut outrageous and reckless men are now masters of it,\nand these countless gifts you bestowed were given in vain,\nfor if you’d found him alive in this land of Ithake\nhe’d have sent you on your way with ample gifts in exchange,\nafter generous entertainment, the due right of the one\nwho began it. Come, tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\nHow many years is it now since you entertained that guest,\nyour unfortunate guest—my son, if he ever existed,\nmy ill-fated son! Far from friends and homeland, either\nfish have doubtless devoured him out in the deep, or else\nhe’s fallen prey on land to wild beasts and birds. Neither\nhis mother nor I, his parents, mourned and enshrouded him;\nnor did prudent Penelope, his well-dowered wife,\nkeen over her own husband, as was fitting, on his bier\nafter closing his eyes—the proper entitlement of the dead.\nAnd tell me this truly also, so I may be certain:\nWho are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\nWhere is the swift ship moored that brought you hither\nwith your godlike comrades? Or did you pay your passage\naboard another’s vessel, so they put you off, and sailed on?”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“I will give you a full and truthful account of these things.\nI come from Alybas, where I live in a well-known house,\nand I’m the son of Apheidas, Lord Polypemon’s son:\nmy own name is Eperitos. Some god drove me off course\nfrom Sikanie, landed me here against my will. My ship’s\nout there, beached off farmland, far distant from the city.\nBut as for Odysseus, this is now the fifth year since\nhe departed from there and left my native country—\nill-fated man! Yet he had good omens on setting out—\nbirds on the right: I was glad of them as I sent him on his way,\nand he was glad at departure. We both had high hopes\nof meeting again as guest-friends, and exchanging splendid gifts.”\nSo he spoke. A black cloud of grief now covered Laertes:\nwith both hands he gathered up the dark grimy dust,\npoured it over his grizzled head, ceaselessly groaning.\nOdysseus’ heart was stirred, and up through his nostrils\nrose a strong sharp pang as he looked at his dear father.\nHe sprang forward, embraced and kissed him, exclaiming: “Father,\nI myself, here, am the man about whom you ask,\ncome back in the twentieth year to my own country!\nSo stop your weeping and tearful lamentation,\nfor I’ll explain everything. But we urgently need to hurry—\nI’ve killed the suitors who were occupying our house,\nin revenge for their outrageous conduct and wicked acts.”\nThen Laertes responded to him, saying: “If it’s true\nthat you who’ve come here are indeed my son, Odysseus,\nthen give me some certain proof that will convince me.”\nTo him resourceful Odysseus responded, saying: “Firstly,\ntake a close look at this scar, from a wound I was dealt\nby the white tusk of a boar out up on Parnassos, when\nI went there because you sent me, you and my lady mother,\nto my mother’s father Autolykos, to collect the gifts\nhe’d agreed and promised to give me when he came here.\nLook, I’ll also tell you the trees that you once gave me\nin our well-laid-out orchard: I asked for each one as I\naccompanied you through the garden—I was still a child.\nIt was these very trees we passed by, and you named them for me,\nand told me about each one. Thirteen pear trees you gave me,\nten apple trees, forty fig trees. Rows of vines too you named,\nand promised me fifty of these, to ripen at different times,\nwith clusters of grapes upon them at every stage, depending\non when Zeus’ seasons brought them to their heaviest weight.”\nSo he spoke, and his father’s knees and heart gave way\nas he recognized the sure signs that Odysseus had given him.\nHe embraced his dear son; but then noble much-enduring\nOdysseus caught and held him close as he fainted. But when\nhe came round again, and the spirit revived in his breast,\nhe responded once more, and spoke, saying: “Zeus, Father,\nyou gods indeed still exist on high Olympos, if it’s true\nthat the suitors have paid the price for their wanton violence!\nBut now I’m terribly scared at heart that very soon all\nthe men of Ithake will come here against us, and send\nurgent messages out to the Kephallenian cities.”\nResourceful Odysseus now responded to him, saying:\n“Never fear, don’t let these matters disturb your mind!\nAnd now let’s go to your house near the orchard, for I sent\nTelemachos on ahead, with the cowherd and swineherd,\nto quickly prepare a meal there.”\nSo the two of them spoke,\nand now made their way to Laertes’ fine house; and when\nthey reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, there they found\nTelemachos and the cowherd and the swineherd\ncarving plentiful meat up and mixing the bright wine.\nNow great-hearted Laertes was bathed there in his house\nby the Sikel servant. She rubbed him down with oil,\nand dressed him in a fine mantle; and Athene stood close,\nand filled out the limbs of the shepherd of the people\nand made him of greater stature and sturdier to behold.\nOut of the bath he came, and his dear son was astonished\nto see him look so like the immortal gods; and he spoke,\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “My father,\nit must be that one of the gods who are forever\nhas improved your looks, made you taller and more handsome!”\nThen sagacious Laertes responded to him, saying:\n“How I wish, by Zeus the Father, by Athene and Apollo,\nthat—as strong as I was when, as lord of the Kephallenians,\nI took Nerikos’ well-built citadel, on the mainland cape—\nin our domain yesterday, my armor about my shoulders,\nstanding beside you I’d helped to beat back those men,\nthe suitors! Then indeed I’d have unstrung the knees of many\nthere in your halls: the sight would have gladdened your heart.”\nSuch was the conversation between them, When the others\nhad finished their work, and the meal was made and ready,\nthey sat down in order on the benches and chairs. As they\nwere reaching their hands to the food, there now came in\nthe elderly Dolios, and with him the old man’s sons,\nall tired from their field work: their mother, old Sikel servant,\nhad gone out and called them in, she who’d brought them up,\nand took good care of Laertes, now great age was on him.\nThey, when they saw Odysseus, and realized who he was,\nstood still, in dumbstruck amazement. But Odysseus\nin conciliatory language now addressed them, saying:\n“Old man, sit you down to dinner, and you others, give over\nyour wonder—we wanted to start on the food, but we’ve\nbeen waiting a while, expecting you any moment.”\nSo he spoke; but Dolios made straight for him, with both\narms outstretched, caught and kissed Odysseus’ hand at the wrist,\nthen addressed him with winged words, saying: “Dear master,\nyou’re back! We missed you so much, we never thought\nwe’d see you again! The gods themselves brought you here!\nGood health to you, a warm welcome, may the gods bless you!\nOh, and tell me this truly, I want to be quite certain:\nDoes prudent Penelope already know for sure\nthat you’re back home, or shall we send her a messenger?”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“She already knows, old man: what need for you to do this?”\nSo he spoke. Dolios sat down again on his polished chair.\nIn the same way, his sons now gathered round famous Odysseus\nmade him welcoming speeches and clasped his hands in theirs,\nand then sat down in order beside their father, Dolios.\nWhile they busied themselves with dinner, there in the hall,\nRumor the messenger sped through the city’s every quarter,\nreporting the hideous death and fate of the suitors. Those\nwho heard it now hurriedly gathered from all directions,\nsobbing and wailing, there in front of Odysseus’ domain.\nOut from it each of them fetched their own dead for burial,\nand all those from other cities they now sent homeward,\nin the charge of seamen aboard swift ships; they themselves\nwent, grieving at heart, in a body to the place of assembly.\nThen, when they were all assembled and met together,\nEupeithes stood up and addressed them, incurable sorrow\na great weight on his heart on account of his own son,\nAntinoos, the first man that noble Odysseus had slain.\nShedding tears for him, he now addressed the assembly, saying:\n“A foul act it was, my friends, that this man committed\nagainst the Achaians! Many fine men he took in his ships,\nand the hollow ships he lost, and the men all perished;\nand others, the best of the Kephallenians, he slaughtered\non his return. So come, before he runs away to Pylos\nor sacred Elis, where the Epeians hold sway,\nlet’s get going, or hereafter we shall be disgraced forever:\nthis matter will be a reproach for men yet unborn to hear of\nunless we’re revenged on the killers of our sons and brothers!\nFor me there would certainly be no pleasure in clinging\nto life—I’d rather die now, join the departed shades!\nSo lets get going, before they cross the sea and escape us.”\nSo he spoke, shedding tears. Pity seized on all the Achaians.\nThen they were joined by Medon and the godlike minstrel\nfrom Odysseus’ domain, for sleep had now let them go.\nThey stood there among them: amazement gripped every man.\nThen Medon, thoughtful and sensible, addressed them, saying:\n“Hear me out now, men of Ithake! Odysseus did not\nperform these deeds without the immortal gods’ support!\nI myself saw a deathless god, who stood beside him,\nin all ways resembling Mentor, yet as an immortal\ngod he appeared there, in front of Odysseus, now\nencouraging him; now again, alarming the suitors\nhe’d storm through the hall, and they fell thick and fast.”\nSo he spoke, and pale fear now seized upon them all.\nThen among them there spoke the aged hero Halitherses,\nson of Mastor: he alone saw both before and after.\nHe with friendly intent now addressed the assembly, saying:\n“Give a hearing, you men of Ithake, to what I shall tell you!\nIt’s your own fault, my friends, that all these actions happened!\nYou wouldn’t listen to me or to Mentor, the people’s shepherd,\nand make your sons give over their mindless stupidity!\nIn their criminal folly they perpetrated a monstrous wrong,\nsquandering the possessions and insulting the bedfellow\nof a most noble man, saying he would never return.\nLet it be this way, then, and do as I tell you: we should not\nstrike back—he that does might bring trouble upon himself.”\nSo he spoke. More than half of them now sprang to their feet\nin a great uproar—the rest stayed together where they were,—\nfor this speech aroused their displeasure, they were convinced\nby Eupeithes, so that now they rushed off for their armor,\nand when they’d clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze,\nthey assembled then in a body in front of the spacious town,\nwith Eupeithes in his folly leading them: he imagined\nhe was going to avenge his son’s murder. He was not destined\nto come back himself, but rather to meet his fate there.\nAthene now spoke to Zeus, the son of Kronos, saying:\n“Son of Kronos, our Father, supreme above all rulers,\nwill you answer my questions? What’s your mind now hiding?\nWill you promote further warfare and the vile din of battle,\nor rather make friendship between the opposing sides?”\nThen Zeus the cloud-gatherer responded to her, saying:\n“My child, why ask me questions about these matters?\nWas it not you yourself who thought up this whole plan,\nfor Odysseus to come home and be revenged on these men?\nSo, do as you please—but I’ll tell you what’s fitting. Now\nthat noble Odysseus has worked his vengeance on the suitors,\nthey must swear a solemn oath: let him be king for life,\nwhile as to the killing of their sons and brothers, let us\nenforce a forgetting of it. Let them, as previously,\nbe friends with each other; let wealth and peace abound.”\nSo saying, he roused Athene, who was eager already, and she\nwent on her way, darting down from Olympos’ heights.\nWhen his group had assuaged their desire for mind-honeying food,\nmuch-enduring noble Odysseus quickly spoke to them, saying:\n“Someone has to go out and see how near they’re getting.”\nSo he spoke. One of Dolios’ sons now went out, as he ordered,\nstood at the threshold and saw them, all close at hand,\nand at once addressed Odysseus with winged words, saying:\n“It’s them, they’re close! We need to arm ourselves at once!”\nSo he spoke; they stood up and donned their armor. Odysseus\nand his men were four, with the six sons of Dolios, while\nLaertes, and Dolios too, both armed themselves as well,\ngrey-haired though they were, now forced to be warriors.\nThen, when they’d clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze,\nthey opened the doors and went out. Odysseus led them.\nAthene, daughter of Zeus, now joined their company,\nlikening herself to Mentor in both voice and appearance.\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus rejoiced at he sight of her,\nand at once he addressed his dear son Telemachos, saying:\n“Telemachos, you’ll now learn for yourself—having come\nwhere battle picks out the truly best men fighting—\nnot in any way to disgrace your fathers’ ancestors, who\nlong ago excelled the world over in manly strength and valor.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“You’ll see me, if you so wish, dear father—such is my spirit—\nin no way, as you say, disgracing your ancestry.”\nSo he spoke. Laertes was glad, and made this declaration:\n“What a great day for me, you kind gods! I’ve joy past measure!\nHere are my son and my grandson contending over valor!”\nGrey-eyed Athene now came up and addressed him, saying:\n“Ah, son of Arkeisios, of all my friends the dearest,\npray first to the grey-eyed maiden and to Zeus her father,\nthen at once whirl up your far-shadowing spear and throw it!”\nSo spoke Pallas Athene, and breathed great strength into him.\nHe made his prayer to Pallas Athene, and at once\nwhirled up his far-shadowing spear, and threw it, and struck\nEupeithes through the bronze cheek piece of his helmet,\nwhich did not hold up the spear: the bronze passed through,\nand he fell with a thud, and his war gear clattered on him.\nThen on their front rank fell Odysseus and his illustrious son,\nstriking at them with swords and twin-edged spears.\nAnd now they’d have killed them all, cut them off from home,\nhad not Athene, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus,\nshouted aloud, and stopped dead all the combatants, saying:\n“Cease this disastrous warfare, you men of Ithake,\nso you may part the sooner, and without bloodshed.”\nSo spoke Athene, and pale fear now seized upon them.\nIn their abject terror the arms now flew from their hands\nand dropped to the ground as the goddess uttered these words,\nand they turned toward the city, longing to save their lives.\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus now gave a fearsome shout,\nand gathered himself and swooped like some high-flying eagle;\nbut then Kronos’ son flung down a smoldering bolt, which landed\nright in front of the grey-eyed child of the mighty Father. At this\nshe, grey-eyed Athene, addressed Odysseus, saying:\n“Scion of Zeus, Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\nhold back now, abandon the strife of leveling battle,\nor Kronos’ son, far-seeing Zeus, may get angry with you.”\nSo spoke Athene: he obeyed, and was happy. A sworn\ntreaty for time to come was now made between both sides\nby Pallas Athene, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus,\nlikening herself to Mentor, in both voice and appearance.\n",

    "We can see that the frequency of lines and words is pretty much aligned throughout the books of the Odyssey, however, they skew to the right because of Book 4, which is longer and shows higher density. This pattern is less visible regarding sentences, meaning that Book 4 has a different style. This is to be expected because most of the Book's content: the encounter of Thelemacus and Pisistratus with Menelaus and Helen, because the language follows the protocol of a \"state\" visit and observes the ceremonial protocol of xenia, it is more formulaic and the sentences are longer than average narration. The regular measure of line (and to an extent words), is contrasted by the fluid measure of sentence length——which depends on stylistic features not on morphology and prosody (which is regular). "

         "\nThe man, Muse—tell me about that resourceful man, who wandered\nfar and wide, when he’d sacked Troy’s sacred citadel:\nmany men’s townships he saw, and learned their ways of thinking,\nmany the griefs he suffered at heart on the open sea,\nbattling for his own life and his comrades’ homecoming. Yet\nno way could he save his comrades, much though he longed to—\nit was through their own blind recklessness that they perished,\nthe fools, for they slaughtered the cattle of Helios the sun god\nand ate them: for that he took from them their day of returning.\nTell us this tale, goddess, child of Zeus; start anywhere in it!\nNow the rest, all those who’d escaped from sheer destruction,\nwere home by now, survivors of both warfare and the sea;\nHim alone, though longing for his homecoming and his wife,\nthe queenly nymph Kalypso, bright among goddesses,\nheld back in her hollow cavern, desiring him for her husband.\nBut when the year arrived, with its circling seasons, in which\nthe gods had ordained he should make his homeward journey\nto Ithake, not even then would he be free of trials,\neven among his own people. All the gods felt pity for him\nexcept for Poseidon, who still nursed unabated wrath\nagainst godlike Odysseus until he reached his native land.\nBut now Poseidon was visiting the remote Aithiopians—\nwho live in two sundered groups, both at mankind’s frontiers,\nthe one at Hyperion’s setting, the other where he rises—\nto receive from them a full sacrifice of bulls and rams,\nand was sitting there at the feast, enjoying himself: the other\ngods were all assembled in the halls of Olympian Zeus.\nDiscussion was started among them by the Father of men and gods,\nwho’d been brooding in his heart over handsome Aigisthos,\nslain by far-famed Orestes, the son of Agamemnon:\nwith him in mind he now spoke among the immortals, saying:\n“My oh my, the way mortals will fasten blame on the gods!\nFrom us, they say, evils come, yet they themselves\nthrough their own blind recklessness have ills beyond\ntheir fated lot, as lately Aigisthos—beyond his fated lot—\nkilled Atreus’ son at his homecoming, married his wife,\nthough he knew this meant sheer destruction, since we’d told him\nbefore the event, sending Hermes, the sharp-eyed Argos-slayer,\nhe should neither slay the man nor marry his bedfellow,\nsince vengeance for Atreus’ son would come from Orestes\nonce he’d reached manhood, and longed for his own country.\nSo Hermes said; but he failed, for all his good intentions,\nto dissuade Aigisthos, who now has paid the full penalty.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Our father, son of Kronos, highest above all rulers,\nthat man indeed was destroyed by well-merited disaster—\nso may all others perish who commit such crimes!—\nbut my heart is distressed on account of clever Odysseus,\nthat ill-fated man, who, far from his dear ones, has long\nsuffered griefs on a sea-ringed island, where the sea’s navel is:\na tree-rich island, and a goddess has her home there,\nthe daughter of crafty-minded Atlas, who knows the depths\nof every sea, who in person shoulders those lofty\npillars that keep earth and firmament apart from each other.\nHis daughter it is who detains that luckless, sorrowful man,\nforever beguiling him with soft and wheedling words\nto forget his island, Ithake. Yet Odysseus, in his yearning\nto perceive were it only the smoke rising up into the sky\nfrom his homeland, longs now for death. But your own heart\ncares nothing for him, Olympian! Did not Odysseus\nby the Argives’ ships honor you with the sacrifices he made\nin the broad land of Troy? Why, Zeus, do you hate him so?”\nCloud-gatherer Zeus responded to her, saying: “My child,\nwhat’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth?\nNow how could I ever forget the godlike Odysseus,\nwho for mind surpasses all mortals, who’s sacrificed most\nto the deathless gods who possess the wide firmament? No,\nit’s Poseidon, the Earth-Shaker, whose fury with him is relentless,\nunceasing, because of the Kyklops, whose eye he blinded—\nthe godlike Polyphemos, whose strength is the mightiest\namong all the Kyklopes: the nymph Thoosa bore him,\ndaughter of Phorkys who rules the unharvested sea,\nfor there in the hollow sea caves she lay with Poseidon.\nThat’s why Earth-Shaker Poseidon is wroth with Odysseus:\nnot killing him, but forever frustrating his homeward journey.\nSo come, let all of us here give some thought to his return,\nhow to get him home safely: Poseidon will have to abandon\nhis rage, he won’t be able, with all the immortals united\nagainst him, to strive alone, lacking the gods’ goodwill.”\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Our father, son of Kronos, highest above all rulers,\nif indeed it is now agreeable to the blessed gods\nthat quick-witted Odysseus should return to his own home,\nlet us then dispatch Hermes, the guide, the slayer of Argos,\nto the isle of Ogygia, so that as soon as may be\nhe can inform the fair-tressed nymph of our firm decision\non steadfast-minded Odysseus: that he’s to return home.\nI meanwhile will go to Ithake, approach his son,\nput more strength in his heart, give him the courage\nto summon the long-haired Achaians to assembly, and make\na strong case to the suitors, who without cease slaughter\nhis flocks of sheep and his shambling, crumple-horned cattle;\nand then I’ll send him to Sparta and sandy Pylos, to seek\nnews of his father’s homecoming—he may learn something—\nand win a good reputation among men at large.”\nSo she spoke,\nand bound on her elegant sandals under her feet,\nimmortal, golden, that bore her both over the sea\nand across the boundless earth, as swift as the wind’s blast;\nand she took her brave spear, so massive, thick and strong,\nits tip of sharp bronze, with which she routs the ranks of men,\nheroes against whom she, a strong sire’s daughter, is wroth,\nand took off, down from the heights of Olympos, landing\non Ithake, right before Odysseus’ outer entrance,\nhis courtyard’s threshold, still grasping the bronze spear,\nin the guise of a stranger, the Taphian leader Mentes.\nThere she found the bold suitors. They at the time\nwere amusing themselves with board games out of doors,\nseated on hides of oxen they themselves had slaughtered,\nwhile heralds and henchmen were busy on their behalf,\nsome mixing wine and water for them in bowls,\nwhile others were swabbing the tables with porous sponges\nand setting them out, or carving meat in lavish helpings.\nBy far the first to see her was godlike Telemachos,\nwho was sitting among the suitors, sorely vexed at heart,\nin his mind’s eye seeing his noble father, how he might\nreturn, make a scattering of the suitors through his domain,\nand himself gain honor, be king of his own possessions.\nThinking thus, there among the suitors, he noticed Athene,\nand went at once to the forecourt, embarrassed at heart\nthat a guest had to wait outside. He stood beside her,\nclasped her right hand, took charge of the bronze spear,\nand addressed her with winged words, saying: “Greetings, stranger!\nAs a guest you’re welcome among us, and afterwards, when\nyou’ve shared our meal, then explain to us what it is you need.”\nThat said, he led the way, and Pallas Athene followed.\nWhen they entered the lofty house, Telemachos carried\nher spear across and stood it beside a tall pillar, in\na polished spear rack, where many more spears were standing,\nthat belonged to steadfast Odysseus. Athene herself\nhe led and had sit down in a backed chair, spreading\na cloth on it first: a finely wrought chair, with footstool,\nand beside it an inlaid seat for himself, away from the others,\nthe suitors, lest his guest, irritated by their uproar,\nshould be put off his food, among such arrogant men—\nand besides, he wanted to ask him about his absent father.\nThen a handmaid brought water for them in an exquisite\ngolden pitcher, poured it into a silver basin, so they\ncould rinse their hands, then set a polished table beside them,\nand a grave housekeeper brought them bread, and with it\nappetizers galore, giving freely of what was to hand,\nwhile a carver made up and sent them platefuls of meat\nof every kind, and set by them golden goblets, while\na herald went to and fro to furnish them with wine.\nThen in came the arrogant suitors, and all immediately\nsettled themselves in rows on the seats and benches,\nand heralds now poured water over their hands, while maids\nbrought them bread by the basketful, and youths\nfilled the bowls to the brim with drink for them, and they\nreached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nthe suitors’ minds now turned to other pleasures,\nto singing and dancing, a feast’s proper complement,\nand a herald brought out for Phemios his well-tuned lyre—\nhe sang for the suitors only because he was forced to—\nand he struck a chord, introducing his own fine song.\nBut Telemachos now spoke to grey-eyed Athene, leaning\nhis head close to hers, so that no one else could hear him:\n“Dear stranger, would you be shocked by what I tell you?\nAll these men care about is music and singing, easy enough\nfor them—they’re freeloading off another man’s livelihood,\na man whose white bones may be rotting in the rain\naway on the mainland, or rolled by the sea’s breakers.\nIf they were to see him, if he ever returned to Ithake,\nthey’d all be praying that they could run away faster, not\nas now, that they were richer in gold and expensive clothes!\nBut no, he must have suffered a wretched fate, nor is there\nany comfort for us, not even should someone, somewhere,\nclaim he’ll come back: his day of returning’s perished.\nBut now tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\nWho are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\nOn what kind of ship did you come here? How did sailors\nbring you to Ithake? What place do they say they’re from?\nFor I don’t imagine you made your way here on foot!\nAnd tell me this truly too, that I may be certain of it:\nIs this your first visit here, or are you one of my father’s\nguest-friends? Many the men who used to visit our home,\njust as he too traveled widely among mankind.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“So, I’ll answer the questions you asked me fully and truthfully.\nI declare I am Mentes, wise Anchialos’ son,\nand that I rule the Taphians, master rowers; and now,\nas you see, I’ve put in here by ship, with my companions,\nsailing the wine-dark deep to meet men of foreign speech,\non my way to Temese for copper, with a cargo of gleaming iron.\nMy ship’s out there, by the countryside, far from the city,\nin the harbor of Rheithron, down below wooded Neion.\nGuest-friends of each other Odysseus and I claim we are\nfrom way back—you can go ask that elderly hero\nLaertes, who, they say, no longer comes to the city,\nbut far away in the backwoods has a hard existence\nwith one old woman servant, who sees to his victuals and drink\nwhen exhaustion steals over and weakens his limbs as he\nshuffles along the high slope of his patch of vineyard.\nSo now I’ve come, for indeed word had it that your father\nwas back home; but the gods must be thwarting his return,\nsince not yet has he died in this world, the noble Odysseus,\nbut still lives, perhaps held prisoner, out on the vast deep\nin some sea-girt island, kept there by violent men,\nwild savages, who, most likely, are holding him under duress.\nBut I shall now make a prediction for you, just as the immortals\nput it into my mind—and I think it will come to pass,\nthough I am no seer, have no clear knowledge of bird-signs!\nNot much longer will he be away from his own beloved\ncountry, no, not even if iron bonds restrain him—he’ll\nfind a way to return, this man of many resources!\nBut now tell me this, and declare it to me truly,\nif indeed, big as you are, you’re Odysseus’ own son—because\nyour head and fine eyes bear an amazing resemblance\nto his: many the hours we spent with one another\nbefore he embarked for Troy, like so many others,\nthe finest of the Achaians, in the hollow ships, and set forth.\nBut since then I’ve not seen Odysseus, nor he me.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“So, stranger, I’ll give you a full and truthful answer.\nMy mother says I’m his child, but for my own part\nI cannot tell: never yet did any man know his begetting!\nIndeed, I could wish I’d been the son of some fortunate\ngentleman, taken by age while among his own possessions!\nBut truth is, it was the most ill-fated of mortals who,\nso they say, begot me—since you’re asking about this matter.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“No nameless lineage, surely, did the gods decree for you\nhereafter, since such as you are you were born to Penelope!\nBut now tell me this, and declare it to me truly:\nWhat party, what gathering’s this? What’s your concern with it?\nA feast, is it? Or a wedding? No communal dinner, surely?\nThe riotous, arrogant manner in which, as it seems to me,\nthey are carrying on in your house! A man might well take offense,\nwalking in on this shameful behavior—any decent man, that is.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Since, stranger, you ask this, and question me on these matters,\nour household once looked to be rich and respectable,\nso long as that certain man was here among his people;\nbut now the gods have willed otherwise, have planned misfortune,\nhave vanished him utterly, as they’ve done to no other man\never—I wouldn’t be grieving so over his death\nhad he fallen alongside his comrades upon Trojan soil\nor expired in his friends’ arms after winding up the war!\nThen all the Achaians would have made him a burial mound,\nand great glory would have been his, and his son’s, hereafter.\nBut now, ingloriously, the storm winds have swept him away.\nHe’s gone, out of sight, out of knowledge, leaving me pain and sorrow\n—and it’s not on his sole account that I’m lamenting now,\nsince the gods have inflicted other harsh troubles on me.\nAll those highborn leaders who lord it over the islands—\nDoulichion and Same and forested Zakynthos,\nbesides those who rule as princes over rocky Ithake—\nare all paying court to my mother, and devouring our property.\nYet she neither refuses this hateful marriage, nor can she make\nan end of the business, while they with feasting keep on\neating away our substance: very soon they’ll destroy me too.”\nOutraged by his statement, Athene responded, saying:\n“It’s true, you’re in urgent need of the vanished Odysseus,\nto come and lay hands on these shameless suitors!\nHow I wish he’d appear now, here at your outer gate,\narmed with helmet and shield and a brace of spears,\nthe way he was the first time I set eyes upon him,\nin our house, drinking wine and enjoying himself, on his way\nback from Ephyre, where he’d gone to see Ilos, Mermeros’ son.\nOdysseus had voyaged there aboard his speedy vessel\nin search of a lethal poison that he wanted to get\nto smear the bronze tips of his arrows. But Ilos refused\nto give it him, fearing the wrath of the gods that are forever;\nyet my father did, for he loved the man most dearly.\nIf only Odysseus might come, thus arrayed, among the suitors!\nThey’d all find a quick death then, and a bitter marriage.\nBut of course all this rests on the knees of the gods—\nwhether or not he’ll return and exact full retribution\nin his own halls. But I urge you yourself to consider\nhow you might drive out these suitors from your household,\nso pay attention now, mark carefully what I tell you.\nTomorrow call an assembly of the Achaian heroes:\nSpeak your mind to them all, let the gods be your witnesses!\nTell the suitors all to disperse, to go back home;\nAnd if your mother’s heart is urging her toward marriage,\nshe should return to her powerful father’s domain,\nwhere they’ll set up the wedding and arrange the bride-gifts,\nlots of them, all that’s fitting to go with a much-loved daughter.\nAnd for you yourself wise advice, if you’ll take it: man a ship,\nthe best you have, with twenty rowers, and go\nto seek news of your father, who’s been so long absent,\njust in case some person can tell you, or you pick up a rumor\nfrom Zeus, the most common way that mortals gather tidings.\nGo first to Pylos, interrogate noble Nestor,\nand from there to Sparta, to fair-haired Menelaos,\nfor he was the last of all the bronze-corseleted Achaians\nto get home. If you hear that your father’s alive, and on his\nway back, then, though beleaguered, hold on for another year;\nbut if you get word that he’s dead, no longer living,\nthen make your way back to your own dear country,\nraise him a burial mound, perform funeral rites at it—\nlavish ones, as is fitting—and find your mother a husband.\nThen, when all this business is over and done with,\nis the time to consider, in your mind and spirit,\nhow you might slaughter these suitors in your halls,\nwhether by guile or openly. It does not become you\nto persist in childish ways: you’re no longer a child.\nOr have you not heard what glory noble Orestes won\namong all mankind when he slew his father’s murderer,\ncrafty Aigisthos, for killing his famous father?\nYou too, my friend—for I see how handsome and tall you are—\nbe valiant, that men yet unborn may speak well of you!\nBut now I shall go back down to my swift ship,\nwhere my comrades must be waiting impatiently for me.\nSo think on these things, and pay heed to what I’ve told you.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Stranger, the words that you said were spoken considerately,\nas a father would speak to his son: I will never forget them.\nBut please do stay longer, though eager to be on your way,\nso that when you’ve had a bath and refreshed your spirit\nyou can go to your ship with a present, happy at heart—\nan expensive and beautiful gift, to be an heirloom for you\nfrom me, such as guest-friends exchange with one another.”\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Delay me no longer—I need to resume my journey:\nand whatever gift your heart incites you to give me,\ngive it me when I return here, to take back home. And choose\nsomething really precious: it’ll bring you its worth in exchange.”\nThat said, the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, departed,\nflying up through the skylight. Into his heart she set\ncourage and strength, and put him in mind of his father\neven more than before. Reflecting on what had happened\nhis mind was in awe: this must be a god, he thought.\nAt once he approached the suitors, a godlike mortal.\nFor them the far-famed minstrel was singing, and they\nsat listening in silence. His song recounted the Achaians’\nwretched homecoming from Troy, laid on them by Athene.\nFrom upstairs the marvelous tale was heard and pondered\nby Ikarios’ daughter, the prudent Penelope, who now\nwent down from her high bright upper chamber: not\nalone, for two of her handmaids followed in attendance.\nWhen she, bright among women, came where the suitors were,\nshe stood by the central post of the snugly timbered roof,\nholding up her shining veil in front of her face,\nand flanked on either side by a devoted handmaid,\nand then, in tears, addressed the godlike minstrel:\n“Phemios, much else you know to keep mortals spellbound—\ndeeds of men and of gods, made famous by minstrels:\ngive them one such song as you sit here, let them in silence\nstill drink their wine, but quit this lay you’re singing,\nso unhappy, it always agonizes the heart in my breast,\nsince on me beyond all others has come unforgettable\ngrief, for that much-loved being I picture with such longing—\nmy husband, of wide renown through Hellas and mid-Argos.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Mother, why do you begrudge so excellent a minstrel\nthe right to please in whatever way he chooses?\nIt’s not minstrels who are at fault, but Zeus, who deals out\nto bread-eating mortals whatever he likes for each.\nDon’t blame this bard for singing the Danaans’ grim fate:\nmen always show most enthusiasm for the newest lay\nthat’s performed with a view to enchant their listening ears!\nSo harden your mind and heart, be resigned to listen:\nIt was not Odysseus alone who lost his day of returning\nfrom Troy—many others perished, just as he did.\nSo go back to your room, get down to your regular tasks,\nat the loom, with the distaff; see to it that your handmaids\ndo their proper work too! But speechmaking is men’s business,\nand mine above all, since mine is the power in this household.”\nTaken aback, Penelope now withdrew to her chamber,\nand stored in her heart her son’s smart observations.\nUpstairs she went, her handmaids with her, and then\nwept for Odysseus, her own dear husband, until\ngrey-eyed Athene spread sweet sleep over her eyelids.\nBut the suitors created an uproar throughout the shadowy hall,\neach praying that he might be the one to bed and lie with her,\nand among them sagacious Telemachos was the first to speak:\n“You, my mother’s suitors, domineering and arrogant,\nfor now let us feast and enjoy ourselves, but please,\nno shouting! It’s a rare pleasure to be able to hear\na minstrel like this one, with a voice like that of the gods!\nBut tomorrow at dawn let’s go and be seated in assembly,\nall of us, where I’ll make you a forthright public request:\nGet out of my home! Go find other feasts for yourselves,\nconsume your own goods, move around from house to house!\nBut if this is what you regard as better, more profitable,\nto devour one man’s livelihood without offering compensation,\nthen gobble on! I’ll petition the gods who are forever,\nand maybe Zeus will grant me an occasion of reprisal,\nso that you, while still feasting for free in my halls, all perish!”\nSo he spoke; and all of them bit their lips hard, astonished\nat the way Telemachos had spoken out so boldly.\nAntinoos, son of Eupeithes, now addressed him, saying:\n“Telemachos, it must be the gods themselves who’ve taught you\nthis high-flown delivery, this audacious way of speaking!\nYou, king of sea-girt Ithake? May the son of Kronos never\ngrant you the throne, though it’s yours by ancestral right!”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Antinoos, what I now say may perhaps offend you.\nThis too I’d be glad to accept, were Zeus the giver:\ndo you think it the worst fate that could befall a man?\nTo be king’s no disaster: right from the start your domain\nIs enriched, and you yourself are held in greater honor.\nStill, there are many other princes of the Achaians,\nboth young and old, who dwell here in sea-girt Ithake:\nany one of them might get this, since noble Odysseus\nis dead. But I shall be lord over our own household,\nand the servants that noble Odysseus got as booty for me.”\nThen Eurymachos, son of Polybos, responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, all these matters rest on the knees of the gods—\nlike, which of the Achaians will be king in sea-girt Ithake!\nSo keep your possessions, lord it over your own household,\nand may the man never come here who’d deprive you by force\nof your possessions, as long as Ithake’s inhabited! Yet\nI’d like, my good friend, to ask you about that stranger—\nWhere did he come from? What country does he claim as his?\nWhere are his relatives, his family acres, to be found?\nDid he come here with news about your father’s return,\nor was it just to take care of some business of his own?\nThe way he took off and vanished, not even waiting\nto meet us—he didn’t look, though, like some common fellow.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Eurymachos, by now all hope for my father’s return\nhas perished. No longer do I trust rumors from any source,\nor give any heed to prophecies, such as my mother\nmight pick up from a seer that she’d invited home.\nAs for this stranger, he’s from Taphos, a friend\nof my father, he says, named Mentes, wise Anchialos’ son,\nand is lord of the Taphians, those master rowers.”\nSo spoke\nTelemachos; but in his heart he knew the immortal goddess.\nThe suitors now turned to dancing and the pleasures of song,\npursuing their revels until it was evening: only darkness\ninterrupted their merrymaking, only then\ndid each of them slope off homeward to take his rest.\nBut Telemachos made his way to the handsome courtyard,\nin a sheltering corner of which his chamber had been built,\nand sought his bed there, pondering much in his mind,\nescorted by his old nurse, who bore the lighted torches—\nfaithful Eurykleia, daughter of Ops, Peisenor’s son.\nLong ago she’d been bought by Laertes, at a good price,\nwhen she was still a young girl: twenty oxen, no less.\nHe respected her in his home no less than his loyal wife,\nbut never made love to her, for fear of his wife’s anger.\nSo now it was she who carried the lighted torches: of all\nthe servants she loved him most, had nursed him as a child.\nHe opened the door of his well-carpentered chamber,\nsat down on the bed and took off his soft tunic,\nthen placed it in the hands of this wise old woman, who\nnow folded and smoothed the tunic, hung it up\non a peg at the side of the corded bedstead, and went\nout of the chamber, pulled the door shut behind her\nwith its silver hook, and drew the bolt home by its thong.\nSo the whole night through, wrapped in a woolen blanket,\nhe brooded over the journey Athene had planned for him.\n",

         "\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nOdysseus’ dear son got up from the bed he’d slept in,\nput on his clothes, slung a sharp sword from one shoulder,\ntied on a pair of fine sandals under his sleek feet,\nand sallied forth from his chamber, in appearance like a god.\nAt once he issued orders to the clear-voiced heralds\nto call to assembly the long-haired Achaians. They made\nthe proclamation he ordered, and quickly the people gathered.\nWhen they were met together in a single body\nTelemachos now joined them, a bronze spear in one hand,\nnot alone, but accompanied by a pair of hunting dogs,\nand wondrous the grace that Athene now shed on him,\nso that the whole crowd watched him as he approached:\nhe sat in his father’s seat, and the elders made way for him.\nThe hero Aigyptios was the first among them to speak,\na man bent with age, of much varied experience.\nBesides, his dear son had accompanied godlike Odysseus\nto Ilion, rich in fine foals, aboard the hollow ships—\nthe spearman Antiphos: but the savage Kyklops had killed him\nin his hollow cave, the last of the crew to be eaten.\nHe had three other sons. One, Eurynomos, joined the suitors;\nthe remaining two looked after the family farmlands. And yet,\ngrieving and sorrowful, he couldn’t forget the lost one.\nIt was in tears for him that he now addressed the assembly:\n“Pay attention, men of Ithake, to what I shall now tell you!\nNot once have we met in assembly, there’s been no session\nsince noble Odysseus set sail in the hollow ships!\nWho, then, has summoned us now? What urgent need\nhas come upon one of our men, whether younger or older?\nHas he had some news about an impending attack\nthat he can explain to us, having heard it earlier?\nOr will he announce for debate some other public business?\nA fine man I think him, and blessed: may Zeus grant\na good fulfillment of whatever his heart desires.”\nSo he spoke, and Odysseus’ dear son rejoiced at the omen,\nnor remained seated longer, in his urgency to speak,\nbut stood up in mid-assembly, while the scepter was placed\nin his hands by the herald Peisenor, a man astute in counsel;\nand then he spoke, first addressing the old man:\n“Old sir, the man’s not far, as you’ll soon learn yourself:\nIt was I who summoned the people: this grief affects me most.\nI’ve had no news of any impending attack\nthat I can explain to you, having heard of it earlier;\nnor shall I announce for debate any other public business,\nbut rather my own needs, because of the double evil\nthat’s befallen my house: I’ve lost my noble father, who once\nwas king among you here, as gentle as any father;\nand now there’s a far worse plague, that will very soon\ndestroy my house altogether, consume my whole livelihood!\nMy mother, against her will, is being pestered by suitors,\nthe sons of those very men who are the noblest here!\nThey shudder at the idea of going rather to the house\nof her father, Ikarios, have him fix his daughter’s bride-gifts\nand betroth her to whom he will, to the man that he prefers;\ninstead, day in day out, they crowd into our house,\nslaughter our oxen and sheep, our fattest goats,\nhold an endless party, swill down our sparkling wine\nwithout restraint. Much is lost already, there’s no man\nsuch as Odysseus was, to save our house from ruin—\nwe ourselves lack the strength to defend it: in the event\nwe’d be shown up as wretched weaklings, unversed in prowess.\nYet indeed I’d defend myself, if the strength was in me,\nfor deeds not to be borne have been done, there’s nothing decent\nin the way my estate’s been destroyed! You should feel ashamed,\nembarrassed before the men in your neighborhood,\nthose who live near here! And beware of the gods’ wrath,\nlest outraged by evil actions they turn against you!\nBy Olympian Zeus I beseech you, and by Themis,\nwho both dissolves and convenes our mortal assemblies,\nforbear, my friends, leave me alone to pine away in bitter\nsorrow—unless it could be that my father, noble Odysseus,\nat some point in anger mistreated the well-greaved Achaians,\nand now you, in angry requital, are mistreating me by urging\nthese suitors on? For me it would be better by far\nwere you yourselves to consume my property and my cattle,\nbecause, if you did the eating, there might some day\nbe recompense—we’d hawk the story round town,\ndemanding back our possessions, till all were restored.\nBut this way you burden my heart with incurable agony.”\nSo he spoke in his anger, then threw down the scepter,\nand burst into tears. Now pity took hold of all the people.\nAll others kept silent; no one could bring himself\nto offer an angry rebuttal to Telemachos’ words:\nonly Antinoos replied to him, saying: “Telemachos,\nlofty orator, angry, outspoken—what is this charge\nyou’re trying to shame us with, put the blame on us?\nIt’s not the Achaian suitors who are guilty in your regard\nbut rather your own dear mother, so expert at deceit!\nFor it’s three years now, and will soon be four, she’s spent\ntoying with the passions in the Achaians’ hearts,\noffering hope to all, making promises to each one,\nand sending them messages, but herself planning otherwise.\nAnd here’s one other deception that she contrived:\nin her halls she set up a great loom and started weaving—\nvery broad was the web, fine of thread—and said to us then:\n‘You young men, my suitors now noble Odysseus is dead,\nbe patient, though eager to wed me, until I finish\nthis web: I should not want my woven work to be wasted—\na shroud for the hero Laertes, against that day\nwhen the grim fate of pitiless death shall overtake him:\nthen the local Achaian women won’t be able to blame me\nfor a man who’d won so much being left with no winding-sheet.’\n“So she spoke; and our proud hearts assented to what she said.\nFrom then on, day after day, she’d be weaving at the great loom,\nbut at night she’d have torches set up, and undo her work.\nThus for three years she beguiled and persuaded the Achaians;\nbut when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round,\nthen it was that one of her women, well aware of what she did,\ntold us, and so we caught her undoing her elegant web,\nand against her will she was forced to finish it. Thus\nthis is the suitors’ response to you, to the end that you\nand all the Achaians may have clear knowledge of it:\nsend your mother away, tell her to make a marriage\nwith whoever her father selects and whom she fancies!\nBut if she goes on tormenting the Achaians’ sons much longer,\nexploiting with forethought those talents Athene gave her—\nexpertise in fine handiwork, outstanding intelligence and\nsagacity, such as we’ve never yet heard ascribed\nto women of old, those fair-tressed Achaian ladies\nTyro, Alkmene, and garlanded Mykene,\nnot one of whom for shrewd planning could rival Penelope—\nthen at least in this matter she made a wrong decision,\nand they’ll go on devouring your livelihood and your stock\nso long as she holds to this purpose that the gods\nhave now put into her heart. She may be winning great fame\nfor herself, but for you regret over your lost plenty.\nAs for us, we’ll not disperse to our homes or anywhere else\nuntil she decides to wed whichever Achaian she picks.”\nSagacious Telemachos replied as follows: “Antinoos,\nI can’t just drive from this house—against her will—\nher who bore and reared me, while my father, alive or dead,\nis in some distant country! And to pay a great sum to Ikarios,\nas I must, if I throw out my mother, would be unfair on me.\nThus I’d get a bad deal from her father, besides which heaven\nwould add to my woes, since my mother on leaving our home\nwould invoke the foul Furies, and I’d be an object of public\ncontempt—so this is a word I shall never utter. And you all,\nif even your hearts are touched by guilt in this matter,\nget out of my home! Go find other feasts for yourselves,\nconsume your own goods, move around from house to house!\nBut if this is what you regard as better, more profitable,\nto devour one man’s livelihood without offering compensation,\nthen gobble on! I’ll petition the gods who are forever,\nand maybe Zeus will grant me an occasion of reprisal,\nso that you, while still feasting for free in my halls, all perish!”\nSo Telemachos spoke, and for him far-seeing Zeus\nsent two eagles flying down from a lofty mountain peak.\nFor a while they glided, riding upon the wind stream,\nside by side, close together, wings wide outspread; but when\nthey arrived at the midpoint of the many-voiced assembly,\nthen they circled over it, with a whirr of beating wings,\ntore each other’s cheeks and necks on both sides with their talons,\nlooking down, with death in their glance, on the heads of the crowd,\nthen sped off to the right, above their homes and city.\nAll were amazed by what they’d witnessed of these birds,\nhad much heart-searching as to what they might portend,\nand were now addressed by the aged hero Halitherses,\nMastor’s son, who excelled all men of his generation\nin his knowledge of bird-signs and at interpreting omens.\nHe, with friendly intent, now spoke before the assembly:\n“Listen well, you men of Ithake, to what I have to tell you!\nAnd the suitors above all should heed the message I bring,\nfor great troubles are rolling toward them, since Odysseus will not\nbe much longer away from his friends: already, I believe,\nhe may well be near, and devising slaughter and death\nfor them all! And for others in plenty he’ll mean trouble,\nwho dwell in sunny Ithake! But we should, well beforehand,\nthink of a way to stop them—or have them desist\nof themselves, since that’s a far better way for them.\nI’m no novice at prophesying, I have sure knowledge,\nand I declare that it’s all now coming true for that man\nexactly as I foretold when the Argives first sailed\nfor Ilion, and he, resourceful Odysseus, among them.\nHaving suffered much, with all his comrades lost,\nrecognized by nobody, after twenty years, I said,\nhe’d return home—and now all this is being fulfilled.”\nEurymachos, Polybos’ son, responded to him, saying:\n“Old man, go home, and prophesy to your children,\nlest they suffer some kind of misfortune in the future!\nFor this I’m a far more reliable prophet than you are.\nThere are birds in plenty that fly to and fro in the daytime,\nyet not all of them carry omens. As for Odysseus, he’s met\na distant death, and you should have perished with him—\nthen you wouldn’t be unloading all these predictions,\nor lending encouragement to Telemachos’ burst of temper,\nin the hope that he’ll reward you with a gift to your family!\nLet me speak plainly—and what I say will come to pass!\nIf you, given all the knowledge that age confers, beguile\na younger man with your words, encourage his resentment,\nfirst, this will make more trouble for the man himself.\n[He won’t get anything done alone, without assistance;]\nand on you, old sir, we’ll impose a penalty that your heart\nwill be in torment at paying, and bitter your agony!\nMy own advice to Telemachos, before you all, is this:\nLet him tell his mother to return to her father’s domain,\nwhere they’ll set up the wedding and arrange the bridal-gifts,\nlots of them, all that’s fitting to go with a much-loved daughter.\nFailing that, I don’t suppose that the sons of the Achaians\nwill abandon their burdensome wooing, since we fear no man—\ncertainly not Telemachos, for all his lengthy rant—\nnor shall we heed any predictions that you, old sir, may make:\nthey won’t come true, and you’ll be hated all the more!\nWhat’s more, his goods will continue to be devoured, without\ncompensation, so long as she continues to stall\nthe Achaians over her marriage! Here we are, kept waiting\nday after day, in rivalry for her virtue, never going\nafter other suitable women, such as each of us might marry.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Eurymachos, and the rest of you, all you noble suitors,\nover this I’ll entreat you no longer, nor discuss it further,\nsince by now the gods are aware of it, as are all the Achaians.\nSo give me a swift ship, along with twenty companions\nas crew on my journey, to both go there and come back.\nFor I’m off to Sparta and sandy Pylos, to enquire for\nnews about the return of my long-absent father.\nMaybe some mortal can tell me, or I can pick up a rumor\nfrom Zeus, the most common way that mortals gather tidings.\nIf I hear that my father’s alive, and on his way back,\nthen, though beleaguered, I’ll hold on for another year;\nbut if I get word that he’s dead, no longer living,\nthen I’ll make my way back to my own dear country,\nraise him a burial mound, perform funeral rites at it—\nlavish ones, as is fitting—and find my mother a husband.”\nThat said, he sat down, and there now stood up among them\nMentor, who’d been a comrade of peerless Odysseus.\nWhen Odysseus set out with his ships, he left him in charge\nof his household, under Laertes, to safeguard everything.\nHe, with friendly intent, now spoke before the assembly:\n“Listen well, you men of Ithake, to what I have to tell you!\nFrom now on let no kindness or gentleness be displayed\nby a sceptered king, let his heart not cherish what’s righteous—\nlet him rather be ever harsh, pursue injustice, since\nthere’s nobody now who remembers godlike Odysseus\nof the people whose lord he was, and kindly as a father!\nIt’s not these arrogant suitors I so much resent,\nfor their violent acts and their nasty-minded misconduct—\nthey risk their own lives by forcibly wolfing down\nOdysseus’ goods, and saying he’ll never return—\nno, it’s you, all the rest of the people, that I find fault with,\nfor sitting there silent, not speaking out roundly to stop\nthese suitors, though they are few, while you are many.”\nAgainst him Leokritos, son of Euenor, now spoke out:\n“Mentor, you mischief-maker, you’re crazy! What’s all this\ntalk about putting us down? It’d be a tough business\neven for more men than these to clamp down on our feasting!\nAnd what if Odysseus himself, the Ithakan, did return,\nto find these haughty suitors banqueting in his palace,\nand resolved in his heart to throw them all out? His wife\nwould get no joy of his homecoming, however deeply\nshe’d missed him: he’d suffer a shameful death on the spot\nif he fought outnumbered. Your threats lack reality!\nAnd you, good people, disperse now, each to his own affairs;\nand as for this fellow here, Mentor and Halitherses\nwill speed his departure—they’re old friends of his father’s!\nBut myself, I think he’ll just sit around listening to rumors\nright here in Ithake: he’ll never accomplish this journey!”\nWith that, he abruptly dismissed the assembly. They all\ndispersed at once, each man to his own house, except\nthe suitors, who went off to the house of godlike Odysseus,\nand Telemachos, who withdrew, alone, to the seashore,\nwashed his hands in the grey salt water, then prayed to Athene:\n“Hear me, you god who came yesterday to our home,\nand told me to travel by ship across the misty deep\nto seek news of my long-absent father’s return!\nNow all my plans are being held up by the Achaians,\nand, above all, by these viciously arrogant suitors!”\nSo he spoke in prayer, and Athene then approached him,\nassuming Mentor’s likeness in both voice and appearance,\nand addressed him as follows, uttering winged words:\n“Telemachos, you’ll turn out neither craven nor witless\nif indeed you’ve been imbued with your father’s rare strength—\nsuch a man he was, so masterful in both deeds and words!\nIn that case your journey won’t be useless or unfulfilled;\nbut if you’re not his son, his and Penelope’s, then\nI have no hope you’ll accomplish what you’re planning.\nFew are the sons who prove the equal of their fathers:\nmost are worth less, hardly any prove themselves better.\nBut since it would seem that you are neither craven nor witless,\nand that Odysseus’ resourcefulness hasn’t passed you over,\nthere is a fair chance that you will bring this business off!\nSo don’t worry about these suitors’ attitudes and notions—\nThey’re witless creatures, neither sensible nor right-thinking,\nand wholly unaware of the fact that death and black fate\nare very near, that on the same day they’ll all perish!\nBut for you that journey you’re planning is not far distant,\nso true a companion I am to your father’s family—\nI’ll fit you out a swift ship, accompany you myself.\nNow go back to the house, keep company with the suitors,\nmake ready provisions, pack them all in containers:\nthe wine in jars, and the barley meal, men’s marrow,\nin stout leather bags. Meanwhile, I’ll go through the town\nand find you a volunteer crew. As for ships, there are plenty\nhere in sea-girt Ithake, both old and new: of these\nI myself will select you the one that best suits your purpose,\nand we’ll soon fit her out, launch her into the open sea.”\nSo spoke Zeus’ daughter Athene. Telemachos did not\nlinger, after he’d heard the voice of the goddess,\nbut made his way back to the house, much troubled at heart,\nand found the proud suitors already there in his halls,\nbusy flaying goats and singeing fat hogs in the courtyard.\nAntinoos, laughing, came over, confronted Telemachos,\ntook his hand, and had this to say to him, speaking plainly:\n“Telemachos, lofty talker, angry, outspoken—no longer\nnurse in your heart any evil thoughts or actions,\nbut, please, eat and drink with us, as you did before!\nAll these things the Achaians will surely provide for you—\na vessel and hand-picked oarsmen, to give you a speedy\nvoyage to sacred Pylos, to seek news of your father.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Antinoos, there’s no way I could feast with you arrogant lot\nundistracted, much less enjoy myself in comfort!\nIs it not enough, you suitors, that in the past you devoured\nso much of my choice possessions, when I was still a child!\nBut now that I’m grown, and can figure the truth from what\nothers tell me, and passion is surging up within me,\nI’ll try directing the evil death-spirits against you, either\nby going to Pylos, or here in this district! But go I will,\nnor shall the journey I speak of be made in vain,\nthough I’m a passenger, lacking a ship and oarsmen\nof my own: this, I presume, was how you wanted it.”\nThat said, he withdrew his hand from the hand of Antinoos,\nlightly. Meanwhile the suitors, busy preparing dinner\nabout the house, made mock of him to each other,\nand this is how one of these arrogant youths would talk:\n“Oh, for sure, Telemachos must be planning our murder!\nHe’ll bring over helpers either from sandy Pylos\nor maybe from Sparta, he wants it so desperately—\nor he’s thinking of going to Ephyre, that rich plowland,\nto pick up some deadly poisons, bring them back here,\ndrizzle them into the wine bowl, and destroy us all!”\nAgain, another of these arrogant youths would announce:\n“Who knows? Maybe he himself, going off in his hollow ship,\nfar from his friends, will die wandering, like Odysseus!\nThat way he’d cause us even more trouble—we’d have\nto share out all his possessions, turn over the house\nto his mother to keep, and whoever it was she married.”\nSo they spoke. Telemachos now went down to his father’s storeroom,\nbroad and high-ceilinged, where gold and bronze lay piled,\nwith clothes in chests, an abundance of sweet-smelling oil,\nand jars of wine, well aged and sweet on the palate,\nholding within them an unmixed heavenly drink,\nset close together along the wall, for the day when Odysseus,\nafter laboring through much hardship, might come back home.\nThe close-carpentered double doors remained shut and locked,\nand both day and night a housekeeper kept watch there,\nguarding everything, both prudent and vigilant:\nEurykleia, daughter of Ops, Peisenor’s son. Her now\nTelemachos called to the storeroom, and addressed her, saying:\n“Good old nurse, please draw me off wine in two-handled jars—\nsweet wine, the best there is after what you’re keeping back\nfor him, the ill-fated one, just in case from heaven knows where\nZeus’ scion Odysseus returns, escaping death and the fates!\nFill me twelve jars, and fit them all with stoppers,\nand measure out barley into well-stitched leather bags—\nthere should be twenty measures of well-ground barley meal.\nHave all this taken care of. No one else is to know about it.\nI’ll pick up the load this evening, when my mother\ngoes to her upper chamber and retires for the night.\nFor I’m making a journey to Sparta and to sandy Pylos\nto seek any news I may learn about my dear father’s return.”\nSo he spoke, and his dear nurse Eurykleia shrieked aloud,\nand, lamenting, then addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Ah, how, dear child, did this thought ever enter your mind?\nWhere in this whole wide earth do you plan to go to, you,\nan only child and much loved? But Odysseus, scion of Zeus,\nhas already died, far from home, in some foreign country,\nand the moment you’re gone these men will make trouble for you,\ndestroy you by guile, and share out all your goods!\nStay here and look after what’s yours: you have no need\nto wander and suffer misfortunes on the unharvested sea.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Never fear, old nurse: this plan does not lack divine support!\nNow, promise you won’t say a word of it to my mother\nbefore eleven or twelve days have passed, or else until\nshe herself misses me and hears that I’ve set out—\nI don’t want her to spoil her fine complexion with weeping.”\nSo he spoke: the old woman swore a great oath, by the gods,\nthat she wouldn’t tell. When she’d sworn, and completed the oath,\nshe at once drew off the wine in two-handled jars,\nand measured the barley meal into well-stitched leather bags,\nwhile Telemachos went back to the hall and joined the suitors.\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another thought:\nin Telemachos’ likeness she went all around the city,\napproaching each man in turn with an identical message,\nthat they should assemble that evening alongside the swift ship.\nThat done, she then asked Noemon, illustrious son\nof Phronios, for a swift ship. He readily promised it her.\nSo the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow,\nand she drew the swift ship down to the sea, and left it\nwith all the gear that well-benched vessels carry,\nmoored at the harbor entrance. Beside it a doughty\ncompany gathered: the goddess put strength in each man there.\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another thought:\nshe made her way to the home of godlike Odysseus,\nand there shed sweet drowsiness over all the suitors\nas they drank, befuddled their wits, made them drop their cups.\nUp they got, to go home to bed: no longer did they\nsit on there, now sleep weighed heavy on their eyelids.\nThat done, to Telemachos grey-eyed Athene now spoke,\ncalled him out from his well-established domain,\nassuming the likeness of Mentor, in both form and voice:\n“Telemachos, already your well-greaved comrades are seated\nat their oars, ready and waiting for the start of your voyage!\nCome then, let’s go, no point in delaying your departure.”\nThat said, Pallas Athene now briskly led the way,\nand Telemachos followed behind, in the goddess’ footsteps.\nWhen they came down to the sea and the vessel, they found\ntheir long-haired comrades there, awaiting them on the shore,\nand Telemachos, princely in power, now addressed them, saying:\n“Come, friends, let us fetch the provisions: they’re all ready,\nback in the hall. My mother knows nothing of this,\nnor do her maidservants, except for the one I told.”\nSo saying, he led the way, and they accompanied him.\nThey carried back all the provisions, stowed them away\nin the well-benched ship, as Odysseus’ fine son commanded.\nThen Telemachos went aboard, preceded by Athene,\nwho sat herself down in the stern, and Telemachos came\nand sat down beside her. Men cast off the stern warps\nand scrambled aboard, and took their seats on the benches.\nNow grey-eyed Athene sent them a following wind,\na fresh west wind, loud-sounding over the wine-dark deep.\nTelemachos urged on his crew, gave them the order\nto haul on the sheets, and they obeyed his command.\nThey raised the fir-wood mast, set it upright in its hollow\nmast-block, firmly belayed the sheets to the forestays,\nthen hauled up the white sail with cords of plaited oxhide.\nThe wind bellied the mid-sail, and cleft by the cutwater\na dark surging wave sang aloud as the ship drove forward,\nshearing her path through the deep, accomplishing her journey.\nWhen they’d belayed the tackle in the swift black ship\nthey set out mixing bowls brimming with wine, and poured\nlibations to the immortal gods that are forever,\nand foremost of all to the grey-eyed daughter of Zeus.\nSo all night and into the dawn the vessel cut her course.\n",

         "\nDeserting the deep’s enchanting surface, the sun rose up\ninto the brazen sky to bring light both to immortals\nand to mortal beings upon the grain-rich plowland,\nand they came to Pylos, the well-built citadel of Neleus.\nHere, on the shore of the sea, sacrifices were being made\nof all-black bulls to the dark-haired Earth-Shaker. Nine\ncompanies there were, and five hundred men were seated\nin each, and each brought nine bulls. It was when they’d sampled\nthe innards and were burning thigh pieces for the gods\nthat the travelers arrived. They at once hauled up and brailed\nthe trim ship’s sail, moored her, and came ashore themselves.\nWith Athene leading the way, Telemachos disembarked,\nand the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, now first addressed him, saying:\n“Telemachos, you’ve no longer the least need for modesty—\nthe whole point of your voyage is to get news of your father:\nwhere he may have been buried, what kind of fate he met.\nBut for now, go straight up to Nestor, tamer of horses,\nand let’s find out what advice lies hidden in his breast!\nEntreat him yourself, have him tell you the true story—\na lie he won’t utter: he’s a most sagacious person.”\nSagacious Telemachos answered her in these words:\n“What, Mentor, must be my approach? How am I to greet him?\nI’ve no experience yet in subtle discourse; a young\nman feels embarrassed when interrogating his elders.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, there are some things you’ll figure out for yourself,\nand for others you’ll have divine guidance—I don’t think\nyou were born and raised without the gods’ good favor.”\nSo Pallas Athene spoke, and proceeded to lead the way\nbriskly, Telemachos following in the goddess’ footsteps,\nand they came to the Pylian men’s assembly and companies.\nThere Nestor sat with his sons, and around them their comrades\nwere preparing the feast, roasting some meat, had the rest on spits.\nBut when they spotted the strangers, they all came flocking\nto meet them, shook their hands, made them sit down.\nPeisistratos, Nestor’s son, was the first to reach them,\ntook them both by the hand, seated them at the feast\non soft sheepskins, there on the sandy seashore,\nnext to his father and Thrasymedes his brother,\ngave them helpings of innards, poured out wine\nin a golden cup, and addressed with welcoming words\nPallas Athene, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis:\n“Make your prayer now, stranger, to the lord Poseidon,\nfor his is the feast you have chanced upon, coming here.\nAnd when you have fittingly prayed and poured libations,\nthen give this man also the cup of honey-sweet wine\nto pour a libation, since he, too, I take it, prays\nto the immortals: all humans stand in need of the gods.\nStill, he is younger, and about the same age as I am:\nthat’s why to you first I now give this golden cup.”\nSo saying, he placed in her hand the cup of sweet wine,\nand Athene rejoiced at this man’s nice sense of decorum,\nin giving the golden cup to her first of all; and at once\nshe offered this heartfelt prayer to the lord Poseidon:\n“Hear me, Poseidon, Earth-Mover! Do not begrudge us\nfulfillment of all that our prayers are now requesting!\nOn Nestor, first and foremost, and his sons, bestow renown,\nand next, to the rest, to all Pylians, grant a pleasing\nrequital for this most splendid and generous sacrifice!\nGrant, too, that we may go home again, Telemachos and I,\nhaving achieved what we came here for in our swift black ship.”\nSo she prayed—and herself was bringing it all to pass.\nNow she gave to Telemachos the fine two-handled cup,\nand in like manner Odysseus’ dear son then prayed.\nWhen the outer meat was roasted, and off the spits, they next\ndivided the helpings, and shared in the sumptuous feast.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nthe first to speak was Nestor, the Gerenian horseman:\n“Now is a better time to interrogate these strangers,\nenquire who they are, now they’ve had their fill of food.\nSo, strangers, who are you? From where was it you sailed here\nover the watery ways? On business? Or are you reckless rovers,\ncruising the sea like pirates, who, at risk of their own lives,\ngo around making trouble for men from other lands?”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, greatly\nencouraged: Athene herself now put fresh confidence\ninto his heart, to enquire about his long-absent father,\n[and win a good reputation among men at large]:\n“Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaians,\nyou want to know where we come from? Then I shall tell you.\nWe’re here from that part of Ithake under Mount Neion,\nand the business I’ll speak of isn’t public, but personal.\nI’ve come to pursue any rumors about my father—\nthe noble, steadfast Odysseus, who once, they say,\nfighting alongside you, brought down the Trojans’ city.\nOf all the others who fought against the Trojans, we’ve since\nlearned how and where it was that each met his grim end;\nbut with him Kronos’ son has ensured that even his death’s\nunknown—no one can say for certain the place where he perished,\nwhether dispatched by enemies on the mainland\nor out on the deep, amid Amphitrite’s breakers.\nThat’s why I’m here at your knees now—you might be willing\nto tell me about his grim death, if you maybe saw it\nyourself, or heard an account of it from some other\nwanderer: to unmatched sorrow his mother bore him!\nAnd don’t, from concern or pity, speak false comfort to me,\nbut tell me exactly whatever you may have witnessed!\nI beseech you, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, made you\nany promise, by word or action, and delivered on it\nin the land of the Trojans, where you Achaians met grief,\nremember it now, and tell me the unerring truth of it.”\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, since you’ve recalled all the grief that we endured\nin that land—we, the dauntless sons of the Achaians!—\nwhether on board our ships, on the hazy deep, in pursuit\nof booty, wherever Achilles might choose to lead us,\nor our drawn-out struggle around King Priam’s great city—\nah, it was there that all our very best were slain!\nThere lies the warrior Aias, there lies Achilles, there\nPatroklos, a man who could match the gods in counsel;\nand there my own dear son, so strong and so virtuous—\nAntilochos, in the first rank as both runner and fighter.\nMany more ills we endured in addition to these: their sum\nwhat transient mortal could ever narrate in full?\nNot even were you to stay for five—no, six!—whole years\nwould you hear of all the woes the noble Achaians bore there—\nand before then, surfeited, you’d have gone back home for sure!\nNine years we were busy cobbling up trouble for them\nwith ruses of every sort: Kronos’ son took a weary age\nto finish the job! There no one tried to compete with noble\nOdysseus in scheming, since he far outstripped them all\nwith ruses of every sort—he, your father, if it’s really true\nthat you are his offspring! When I look at you I wonder,\nfor your way of speaking is like his, one would never think\nthat so young a man could speak in so proper a manner!\nThe whole time noble Odysseus and I were out there, neither\nin council nor in assembly did we oppose each other,\nbut, being of one mind, with good plans and shrewd judgment\nwe’d counsel the Argives on their best course of action.\nBut after we’d sacked the towering citadel of Priam\nand had sailed away, and a god had scattered the Achaians,\nthen indeed it was that Zeus planned a grim homecoming\nfor the Argives, since not all of them were either right-thinking\nor civilized: thus many met a bad end through the deadly\nwrath of the grey-eyed daughter of a mighty sire. It was she\nwho stirred up strife between the two sons of Atreus.\nThe two of them called an assembly of all the Achaians,\nthoughtlessly, not in due order, very close to sunset,\nand the Achaians’ sons arrived well loaded with wine\nto hear their speeches, and learn why they’d been summoned.\nNow Menelaos was urging the whole body of the Achaians\nto embark on the voyage home, over the sea’s broad back;\nbut this didn’t please Agamemnon at all: what he wanted\nwas to keep the army in place, and make lavish sacrifices\nto appease the dread wrath of Athene—fool that he was,\nnot knowing that she wouldn’t pay him the least attention,\nsince the mind of the gods eternal is not changed in a moment.\nSo the pair of them stood there, exchanging angry words,\nwhile the well-greaved Achaians sprang to their feet with a deafening\nclamor, and both these schemes collected their supporters.\nWe spent that night nursing harsh thoughts against\none another, while Zeus was devising a grief of evils. At dawn\nsome of us hauled our vessel down to the bright salt sea,\nand put aboard our possessions and our deep-sashed women;\nbut half of the force held back, remained in place there\nwith Atreus’ son Agamemnon, his people’s shepherd.\nSo half of us now embarked, and rowed out: swiftly our ships\nmoved on, for a god smoothed the monster-infested deep.\nWhen we reached Tenedos we sacrificed to the gods,\nlonging for home; but Zeus, not thinking yet of return—\nthe wretch!—rather stirred up bad strife for the second time!\nSome now brought their curved vessels around, sailed back\nwith lordly Odysseus—so clever, so subtle-minded—\nonce again showing favor to Atreus’ son Agamemnon;\nbut I, with the full squadron of ships that followed me,\nkept retreating—I realized the god was planning trouble!—\nas did Tydeus’ son too, Ares’ favorite, urging on his men,\nwhile, late in the day, there followed us fair-haired Menelaos,\nwho caught up with us at Lesbos, debating the long voyage—\nshould we set our course seaward, north of rocky Chios,\nby the island of Psyra, with Chios on our port side,\nor sail landward of Chios, past Mimas’ windswept headland?\nSo we asked the god to show us a sign, and he did,\nbidding us cut our way through the deep-sea route to Euboia,\nand thus the soonest get ourselves clear of misfortune.\nA good tailwind got up now and blew: our vessels ran\nswiftly across the sea’s fish-rich paths and reached\nGeraistos at night: to Poseidon we sacrificed many\nbulls’ thighs, grateful that we’d traversed the open water.\nIt was on the fourth day that the comrades of Diomedes\nthe horse breaker anchored their trim ships at Argos;\nbut I held on course for Pylos, nor did that good tailwind\ndrop once, from the time the god first set it on to blow.\nThus I came back, dear child, without news, nor do I know\nanything of the rest, which Achaians survived, which perished.\nBut such reports as have reached me while ensconced here at home\nI shall pass on, as is proper, and not conceal them from you.\nThe Myrmidons, those fierce spearmen, they say made it back,\nled by great-hearted Achilles’ illustrious son; back too\ncame Philoktetes, the distinguished offspring of Poias,\nwhile Idomeneus brought safely home to Krete all those\ncomrades surviving the conflict: the sea took none of them.\nAbout Atreus’ son you yourselves, though distant, will have heard:\nhow he returned, how Aigisthos devised a grim end for him.\nYet Aigisthos indeed was to pay a most terrible reckoning:\nso it’s good that when any man dies a son should survive,\nsince here was a son took revenge on his father’s killer—\nthe crafty Aigisthos, who’d murdered his famous father.\nYou too, my friend—for I see how handsome and tall you are—\nbe valiant, that men yet unborn may speak well of you!”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Nestor, Neleus’ son, great glory of the Achaians,\nthat man indeed got full vengeance, and the Achaians\nshall spread his fame far and wide, for men unborn to hear!\nIf only the gods would endow me with the strength\nto punish these suitors for their grievous transgression—\ntheir wanton insults, their malicious acts against me!\nBut no such good fortune have the gods ever assigned\nto me or my father: now I just have to endure.”\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, since by mentioning it you’ve reminded me of this,\nnumerous suitors, they say, for your mother’s hand, are there\nin your halls against your will, and making trouble for you.\nSo tell me, are you letting yourself be bullied, or do\nthe folk of the district, swayed by some god’s word, despise you?\nWho knows, one day he may come back, may be revenged,\neither alone, or with all the Achaians. If only grey-eyed\nAthene might choose now to love you as much as once,\nlong ago, she was concerned for renowned Odysseus\nin the land of the Trojans, where we Achaians suffered\nmuch hardship: for never I saw such open love from the gods\nas Pallas Athene showed him, standing openly at his side!\nIf she would love you as much, and care for you in her heart,\nthen some of these men would quite forget about marriage.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying\n“Old sir, I don’t think your words will ever find fulfillment:\nWhat you say is too much, I’m dumbfounded, what I hope for\ncould never happen, not even were the gods to will it so!”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, what’s this word has escaped your teeth’s barrier?\nA determined god could save a man easily, even from afar!\nI’d rather endure endless setbacks on the journey back\nbefore I got home, and saw the day of my returning,\nrather than make it there only to perish, as Agamemnon\nwas killed by Aigisthos’ treachery, and that of his own wife.\nYet death, that’s common to all, not the gods themselves\ncan ward off even from a man they love, whenever\nthe dire fate of pitiless death has once got hold of him.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“Mentor, despite our grief, let’s talk no more of these matters:\nFor him a return’s not reality now: long, long before this\nfor him the immortals will have contrived death and black fate.\nBut now I want to ask Nestor about a different matter,\nsince his knowledge of justice and wisdom is unsurpassed—\nthree times, they say, he’s ruled a generation of men,\nand to me he has the appearance of an immortal!\nSo, Nestor, son of Neleus, tell me this in all honesty:\nhow did Atreus’ son die, wide-ruling Agamemnon?\nAnd where was Menelaos? What death for the king did sly\nAigisthos contrive, since it was a far better man he killed?\nWas he, Menelaos, not there in Achaian Argos, but roaming\nabroad, so that Aigisthos could nerve himself for murder?”\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, responded to him, saying:\n“Very well then, my child: I shall tell you the whole truth.\nYou yourself are clear how all this would have turned out\nhad Atreus’ son, fair-haired Menelaos, discovered,\non his return from Troy, Aigisthos alive in his halls!\nNot even on his corpse then would the earth have been piled,\nbut the dogs and the birds of prey would have devoured him\nas he lay on the plain, far outside the city, nor would any\nAchaian women have mourned him, so vile the deed he wrought.\nWhile we were bivouacked out there, campaigning long and hard,\nhe, at his ease in a corner of horse-grazing Argos,\nwas making seductive proposals to Agamemnon’s wife.\nNow she indeed to begin with rejected the shameful act,\ndid the noble Klytaimnestra, since hers was a virtuous heart;\nand with her she had a minstrel, whom Atreus’ son had ordered,\nbefore leaving for Troy, to be her strict bodyguard.\nBut when divine destiny ensnared her for destruction,\nthen it was that Aigisthos marooned the minstrel, left him\non a desert island, a tasty morsel for birds of prey.\nHer then he took back—both willing—to his own home.\nMany thigh pieces he burned on the gods’ hallowed altars,\nand hung up numerous offerings, both woven and golden,\nafter bringing off the vile action he never hoped to achieve.\n“We were sailing together on our way back from Troy,\nAtreus’ son and myself, close friends with one another;\nbut when we reached sacred Sounion, the headland of Athens,\nthere it was that Phoibos Apollo slew Menelaos’ steersman,\nassailing him with his painless shafts while in his hands\nhe still held the steering oar of the speeding vessel—\nPhrontis, the son of Onetor, who excelled all tribes of mankind\nat steering a ship when gale-force winds were blowing.\nSo Menelaos put in there, though impatient to be sailing,\nto bury his comrade, perform the proper rites over him.\nBut when he too in his voyage over the wine-dark deep\nin his hollow ships arrived off the sheer heights of Malea,\nrunning swiftly, then far-seeing Zeus devised a way to make\nhis voyage disastrous: poured blasts of shrill winds on him,\nswelled the waves to vast size, till they resembled mountains.\nThen he split the flotilla in two, directed some ships to Krete,\nto where the Kydonians dwelt around Iardanos’ streams.\nThere’s a certain steep headland, juts sheer out into the sea,\nat the frontier of Gortyn, in the mist-shrouded deep,\nwhere southwest gales drive great waves against the headland’s\nleft side, toward Phaistos, and low rocks hold back the waves’\nviolence. Here some ships came, their crewmen barely\nescaping disaster: the ships themselves were smashed\nto pieces upon the reef. But the five other dark-prowed vessels\nwere carried away by wind and wave to Egypt.\nSo Menelaos spent time there amassing goods and gold,\ngoing to and fro in his ships among men of alien speech.\nMeanwhile Aigisthos back home enacted his grim plot:\nhe killed Atreus’ son, had the people as his subjects.\nSeven years he reigned as king over golden Mykenai\nbut in the eighth evil came for him—the noble Orestes,\nback home from Athens, who slew his father’s slayer,\nthe crafty Aigisthos, who’d murdered his famous father.\nAfter he’d killed him, he held a funeral feast for the Argives\nover his hateful mother and the cowardly Aigisthos,\nand that same day there arrived Menelaos of the great war cry,\nwith treasure galore, as much freight as his ships could carry.\n“So you too, friend, should not wander over-far from home,\nleaving your wealth behind you, as well as men in your house\nof such arrogance, lest they share and devour your goods,\nmaking your journey here a mere fool’s errand! But now\nthe man I insist on your visiting is Menelaos, for he\nhas lately returned from abroad, got himself back home\nfrom a people that no one would ever hope in his heart\nto return from, once great storms had driven him off course\ninto a sea so vast that migrant birds take an entire\nyear to travel back from it, so vast and fearsome it is!\nSo be off with you now, you, your ship, and your comrades—\nor go overland if you’d rather: here are chariot and horses,\nand here, too, are my sons, who’ll accompany you as guides\nto lordly Lakedaimon, home to fair-haired Menelaos.\nAppeal to him in person, to tell you the whole truth:\nHe won’t tell you lies, he’s far too sagacious.” So\nhe spoke, and the sun went down, and darkness came on.\nAmong them there then spoke the goddess, grey-eyed Athene:\n“Old sir, all this that you’ve told us was properly conveyed.\nBut come now, cut up the ox tongues, and mix the wine,\nso that after libations to Poseidon and the other immortals\nwe may turn our minds to sleep: that time has arrived.\nLight’s passed under darkness already, and it’s not fitting\nto sit late at a feast of the gods: best to be on one’s way.”\nSo spoke the daughter of Zeus, and they paid attention to her.\nHeralds now poured out water over their hands,\nwhile young men topped up the mixing bowls with wine\nand served it to them all, with drops first in each cup.\nThe tongues they threw in the fire, then stood, and poured\nlibations on them. This done, when they’d drunk as much\nas they felt like, then both Athene and godlike Telemachos\nwere eager to be on their way to the hollow ship;\nbut Nestor spoke persuasively, anxious to keep them there:\n“Zeus forbid, and all the other immortal gods,\nthat you should go back from my house to your hollow ship\nas though from some indigent wretch with no spare bedclothes,\nno coverlets in his home, no abundance of blankets\non which both he and his guests could sleep in comfort!\nHere in my house are coverlets and the finest blankets,\nand never shall the dear son of that fine man Odysseus\nbed down on a ship’s afterdeck as long as I’m alive,\nand sons survive after me, are left here in my halls\nto look after whatever guest-friend may come visiting.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“This was well said, old friend! And it’s right that Telemachos\nshould listen to you, since that is by far the better way.\nSo he’ll stay with you tonight, sleep on a bed in your house;\nbut I shall take myself off to our black ship,\ncheer our companions, tell them all the news.\nFor I think I’m the only older person among them:\nthe rest are younger men, who came with him as friends,\nall about the same age as great-hearted Telemachos.\nIt’s there I shall lie tonight, by the hollow black ship;\nthen tomorrow morning I’ll be off to the great-hearted\nKaukonians, where there’s a debt owed to me, neither recent\nnor small. But you send this young man, your visiting guest,\non his way in a chariot, along with your son, and give him\nhorses as well, your lightest runners, your best for strength.”\nSo saying, the grey-eyed goddess Athene went on her way\nin the likeness of a sea eagle: all who saw it were astounded,\nincluding old Nestor, who marveled at what his eyes beheld,\nand he clasped Telemachos’ hand, and said to him: “Friend,\nI hardly think you’ll turn out a mean fellow or a coward\nif indeed when you’re so young the gods act as your escorts!\nFor this was none other of those whose homes are on Olympos\nthan Zeus’ own true-born daughter, maiden most glorious, who\nlikewise honored your noble father among the Argives!\nBe gracious to me, my queen, grant me high renown\nfor myself, for my sons, and for my revered bedfellow,\nand to you in return I’ll sacrifice a yearling heifer, broad-browed,\nstill unbroken, that no man has yet led under the yoke:\nthat’s the one I shall sacrifice, and gild her horns with gold.”\nSo he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him.\nNow Nestor, Gerenian horseman, led them, with his sons\nand his daughters’ husbands, to his splendid domain,\nand when they reached the renowned domain of the king,\nthey sat down there in order on the chairs and benches.\nWhen all of them were settled, the old man mixed them a bowl\nof delicious wine, which was in its eleventh year\nwhen the housekeeper broke its seal and opened the jar.\nThis wine the old man mixed, with many prayers, as he poured\nlibations to Athene, daughter of Zeus of the aegis.\nWhen they’d poured libations, and drunk all they’d a mind to,\nthey went to lie down and sleep, each one in his own dwelling.\nBut Nestor, Gerenian horseman, kept Telemachos, the dear son\nof godlike Odysseus, to sleep there, settling him down\non a corded bedstead out in the echoing portico,\nand with him Peisistratos, of the good ash spear, a leader\nof men, a still unmarried son of his in the halls,\nwhile he himself took his repose in the high house’s inmost room,\nand beside him his lady wife now shared their bed and marriage.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, rose from his bed, went out,\nand sat himself down on one of the polished stone blocks\nthat stood outside his high entrance doors, bright white\nwith a gleam as of oil. This was the place where in time past\nNeleus would sit, a counselor as prestigious as any god;\nbut he’d long since succumbed to fate, gone down to Hades,\nand now Gerenian Nestor, the Achaians’ guardian, sat there,\nscepter in hand, and around him a crowd of his sons gathered,\ncoming out from their bedrooms: Echephron, Stratios,\nPerseus, Aretos, and—a match for a god—Thrasymedes;\nthen, sixth after these, the hero Peisistratos followed,\nbeside whom they brought in and seated godlike Telemachos.\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, was the first to speak among them:\n“Quickly now, my dear children, help realize my desire—\nthat very first of all deities I may propitiate Athene,\nwho came, clearly manifest, to our rich feast for the god!\nSo let one man go to the plain for a heifer, making sure\nthat it comes here right away, with its cowherd driving it;\nand another to the black ship of great-hearted Telemachos,\nto fetch all his comrades, leaving there two men only;\nand another again to send here the goldsmith Laerkes,\nto overlay the horns of the heifer with gold. You others\nare all to stay here, and issue instructions to my servants\nthat they should make ready a feast in my far-famed halls,\nand bring in more chairs and firewood and clear bright water.”\nSo he spoke, and they all bustled busily. The heifer arrived\nfrom the plain, and, from their swift trim vessel, great-hearted\nTelemachos’ comrades showed up. The smith came too\nbringing his bronze tools, the essentials of his trade:\nanvil and hammer and finely fashioned tongs\nwith which he worked the gold. Athene likewise came\nto be there at the sacrifice. Then Nestor, old chariot driver,\ngave the smith gold: he prepared it, overlaid the heifer’s horns,\nthat the goddess might rejoice at the sight of her offering.\nBy its horns Stratios and noble Echephron led in the heifer,\nand Aretos, bringing out water in a flower-decked basin,\ncame from the inner chamber, in his other hand a basket\nof barley-grain; Thrasymedes, that doughty fighter, stood by,\na sharp axe in his hand with which to fell the heifer,\nwhile Perseus readied the blood bowl. Nestor, old chariot driver,\nbegan with the lustral water and sprinkling of barley, offered\nlong prayers to Athene, threw the victim’s cut hairs in the fire.\nWhen they’d prayed, and scattered the barley grains, then at once\nNestor’s son, high-spirited Thrasymedes, stepped\nforward and struck. His axe sheared through the neck’s tendons,\nundid the strength of the heifer. The women keened:\nthe daughters, the sons’ wives, Nestor’s revered\nbedfellow Eurydike, the eldest of Klymenos’ daughters.\nThe men now raised the victim from the wide-wayed earth\nand held it; Peisistratos, leader of men, cut its throat.\nWhen the black blood had flowed from it, and life had left its bones,\nat once they dismembered it, chopped out the thigh pieces\nall in due order, then covered them with a layer of fat\nfolded double, laid raw bits of meat upon them. Then\nthe old man roasted them over split billets, drizzled with bright\nwine, and young men beside him held their five-pronged forks.\nWhen the thighs were properly barbecued, and they’d had a taste\nof the innards, they cut up the rest and roasted it on spits\nuntil it was done through, held the pointed spits in their hands.\nTelemachos meanwhile was bathed by beautiful Polykaste,\nthe youngest daughter of Nestor, Neleus’ son; and after\nshe’d bathed him, and massaged him generously with oil,\nand dressed him in a fine mantle and tunic, he came forth\nfrom the bathtub in appearance like the immortals, and went\nand seated himself by Nestor, the shepherd of his people.\nWhen the outer flesh was well roasted they drew it off the spits,\nand sat down and feasted; good fellows waited on them,\npouring the wine out for them into golden goblets.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nNestor, Gerenian horseman, was the first to speak among them:\n“Come, my sons, harness up our fine-maned horses to\nthe chariot for Telemachos, so he can start his journey.”\nSo he spoke, and they hearkened promptly, and obeyed him:\nat once to the chariot they harnessed the swift horses,\nand the housekeeper put in the chariot bread and wine\nand cooked meat, such as princes, Zeus’ nurslings, feed upon.\nThen Telemachos climbed aboard the elegant chariot,\nAnd Nestor’s son Peisistratos, leader of men,\nmounted beside him, took the reins in his hands, and used\nthe whip to start the pair: they, nothing loath, sped off\nonto the plain, abandoning Pylos’ steep citadel,\nand all day shook the yoke that spanned their shoulders.\nThen the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow,\nand they came to Pherai, to the dwelling of Diokles\nthe son of Ortilochos, whom Alpheios sired as his offspring,\nand spent the night there; he treated them as guest-friends.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthey yoked the horses, boarded the inlaid chariot,\ndrove out from the courtyard and echoing portico, used\nthe whip to start the pair: they, nothing loath, sped off,\nand came to the wheat-bearing plain. From there they pursued\ntheir journey at speed, so well did their swift horses bear them.\nThen the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow.\n",

         "\nNow they came to deep-hollowed Lakedaimon with its ravines\nand drove till they reached the domain of far-famed Menelaos.\nHim they found holding a wedding feast with his many kinsmen\nfor a son and an elegant daughter, there in his own dwelling:\nher he was sending out to Achilles’ son, the rank-breaker,\nfor in Troy’s country he first had pledged his word that he’d\ngive her to him, and now the gods were fulfilling the match.\nWith horses and chariots she was soon to travel\nto the Myrmidons’ famed city, where her spouse was king;\nwhile he was bringing from Sparta Alektor’s daughter,\nto wed his favorite son, the doughty Megapenthes,\nborn of a slave girl: to Helen the gods granted no more\nissue after her first child, the lovely Hermione,\nwho had all the beauty of golden Aphrodite. So they\nwere feasting there in the spacious high-roofed hall—\nthe neighbors and kinsmen of far-famed Menelaos,\nat ease, while among them a godlike minstrel was singing\nand playing the lyre, while two tumblers circled\nabout in the thick of them, leading off the dance.\nThe two out at the gateway, themselves and their horses—\nthe hero Telemachos and Nestor’s splendid son—\npulled up short, were seen by the lord Eteoneus as he\ncame out: he, the deft squire of far-famed Menelaos.\nBack through the hall he went to tell the people’s shepherd,\napproached him, and standing close uttered these winged words:\n“Menelaos, Zeus’ nursling, there are two strangers here—\ntwo men who look very much like the offspring of great Zeus!\nTell me, shall we unharness their speedy horses,\nor send them on somewhere else for their entertainment?”\nMuch annoyed, fair-haired Menelaos made him this answer:\n‘You used not to be a fool, Eteoneus, Boethoos’ son,\nhitherto: but now you’re babbling nonsense like a child!\nWe two ate well and often as the guests of other men,\ngenerous hosts, on our way home, hoping only that Zeus\nmight rid us of sorrows hereafter. So go, unyoke the horses\nof these our guests, bring the guests themselves to the feast!”\nSo he spoke. Eteoneus ran through the hall, calling out\nto his busy fellow attendants to follow along with him.\nThey unharnessed the sweating horses from the yoke pole\nand tethered them by their reins at the mangers for horses,\nscattering fodder for them, emmer mixed with white barley.\nThen they left the chariot resting against the white entrance walls\nand led their guests into the godlike domain. What they saw\namazed them, passing through the abode of this king who was\nZeus’ nursling: a brightness like that of the sun or moon\nlit up the high-roofed dwelling of far-famed Menelaos.\nAnd when they’d feasted their eyes on this spectacle, they stepped\ninto polished bathtubs and were bathed. Then, after\nmaidservants had washed them, massaged them with oil,\nand clothed them in tunics and woolen mantles, they\nsat down on high chairs next to Atreus’ son Menelaos.\nA handmaid fetched and poured them water from a pitcher—\nexquisite, golden—over a silver basin, for them\nto wash their hands, and placed a polished table nearby,\nwhile the dignified housekeeper brought bread, set it before them,\nwith various side dishes, giving freely of her provisions,\nand the carver loaded and brought to them platters of meat\nof every kind, and put golden goblets before them.\nThen fair-haired Menelaos welcomed them in these words:\n“Fall to, and enjoy yourselves! Afterwards, when you’ve eaten\nyour dinner, then we’ll question you as to who you may be\namong men, for in you two the ancestry’s not obscure—\nyour mortal bloodline’s that of those sceptered princes,\nZeus’ own nurslings: no commoner could have sired such sons.”\nWith that he picked up and set before them the fat beef chine,\nwell roasted, that he himself had received as an honor. Then they\nreached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nthen it was that Telemachos spoke to the son of Nestor,\nhead leaning close to him, so that others might not hear:\n“Just look, son of Nestor, friend dear to my heart, at all\nthe bright shine of bronze throughout these echoing halls,\nthe gleam of gold and amber, of silver and ivory!\nThe court of Olympian Zeus must be like this inside,\nthere’s such limitless wealth here: I’m awed by the sight of it!”\nAs he spoke, fair-haired Menelaos picked up what he said,\nand addressed them both as follows, in winged words:\n“Dear children, with Zeus no mortal might ever contend,\nfor eternal are his residences and his possessions;\nbut of men I might have a rival, or again I might not,\nin possessions! True, after I’d suffered much, wandered far,\nI came back home in the eighth year, bringing my wealth\nin my ships, having visited Cyprus, Phoenicia, Egypt,\nthe Aithiopes, the Sidonians, and the Eremboi,\nand Libya, where the lambkins grow horns almost from birth,\nand the ewes give birth three times within a single year,\nso that neither master nor shepherd ever goes without\ncheese or mutton or sweet milk, but their flocks\nare ready for milking the whole year through. But while\nI was busy amassing a sizable livelihood as I roamed\nfrom country to country, another man killed my brother—\nsecretly, caught him off guard, through the guile of his damned wife!\nSo it gives me no pleasure to be lord of these possessions.\nBesides, you’ll have heard all this from your fathers, whoever\nthey are, since I suffered greatly, losing a well-established\nhousehold, that contained many rare possessions! If only\nI could live in this house of mine with no more than a third\npart of those goods, and that all the men were alive still\nwho died in broad Troy, far away from horse-grazing Argos!\nYet though I so often weep and lament for them all\nas I sit here in my home—at times I indulge my heart\nby mourning, but then again I’ll stop, for all too soon\none reaches one’s surfeit of sorrow—nevertheless,\ndespite my grief, I don’t mourn so much for them all\nas for that one, who makes me abhor both sleep and food\nwhen I recall him: no other Achaian suffered such hardship\nor achieved as much as Odysseus, though for himself\nwhat was destined was trouble, and for me unforgettable\nendless grief over him: he’s been gone so long, we can’t tell\nif he’s living or dead! They must be mourning him now—\nold Laertes, prudent Penelope, and Telemachos, still\na newborn child in the house at the time he left”—in whom,\nso speaking, he stirred the urge to mourn his father. Tears\ndropped from Telemachos’ eyelids as he heard his father’s name,\nand with both hands he held his purple mantle up\nin front of his eyes. Menelaos took note of what he did,\nand turned over in his mind and in his heart the thought:\nshould he let the boy mention his father first himself,\nor rather question him first, examine him on each matter?\nWhile he was debating thus, in his mind and heart,\nHelen came in, from her fragrant high-roofed boudoir,\nlike Artemis of the golden distaff, and with her Adreste,\nwho brought out for her a finely made recliner,\nwhile Alkippe fetched her a rug of the softest wool,\nand Phylo a silver basket given her as a present\nby Alkandre, the wife of Polybos, who dwelt in Egyptian\nThebe, where the richest goods adorn all private homes:\nhe made Menelaos a present of two silver bathtubs,\na pair of tripods, and ten talents of gold. In addition\nhis wife presented Helen with magnificent gifts:\na golden distaff she gave her, and a work basket on wheels,\nfashioned of silver, its rims all finished off with gold.\nIt was this that her handmaid Phylo brought in and placed\nbeside her, full of yarn already spun, and across it\nwas laid the distaff, loaded with darkly violet wool.\nHelen sat down in the recliner, a footstool under her feet,\nand at once let fly at her husband a row of questions:\n“Menelaos, nursling of Zeus, do we know who these men\nare, or say they are, who’ve come to our house? Shall I\nkeep quiet or say what I think? Oh, I simply must tell you!\nNot once did I ever see such a striking resemblance,\nin either a man or a woman—it truly astounds me!\nThis boy could be the son of great-hearted Odysseus,\nTelemachos, left as a newborn child in the house\nby him, when because of me, the bitch, you Achaians\nwent out against Troy, hearts set on ruthless warfare.”\nThen fair-haired Menelaos responded to her, saying:\n“I too see the likeness now, wife, exactly as you perceive it:\nsuch as this boy’s were Odysseus’ feet and hands,\nand the way he’d glance, and his head, and the hair above it!\nAnd when, just now, I was reminiscing about Odysseus,\nrecounting all the sorrows and hardships that he endured\non my behalf, the boy shed bitter tears from under\nhis eyelids, held up that purple mantle before his eyes.”\nTo him Peisistratos, Nestor’s son, now responded, saying:\n“Atreus’ son Menelaos, Zeus’ nursling, leader of troops,\nthis youth is indeed his son, exactly as you tell it!\nBut he’s also modest, and personally embarrassed\nby the thought of being too outspoken in what he says\nbefore you, whose voice delights us both like a god’s.\nAs for me, the Gerenian horseman Nestor sent me\nto be Telemachos’ escort, since he was eager to see you,\nand hoped you’d give him some encouraging word or action;\nfor many troubles a son encounters at home when his father’s\nlong absent, when he’s got no other supporters, as now\nit is with Telemachos: his father’s away, nor are there\nany others among his people who’d stave off trouble from him.”\nThen fair-haired Menelaos responded to him, saying:\n“Wonder of wonders! There’s come to my house the son\nof a man who’s my dear friend, who faced much hardship\non my account: when he came home, I figured I’d welcome him\nmore than all other Argives—if we two ever got back over\nthe sea in our swift ships, thanks to far-seeing Olympian Zeus!\nI’d have made some Argive town his, built a house there for him,\nfetched from Ithake his son, his possessions, all his people—\nexpelling the population of one of those cities located\nround about, those that acknowledge me as their ruler.\nBoth living here, we’d have seen a lot of each other: nothing\nwould have kept us apart, away from friendship’s pleasures,\nuntil the black cloud of death in the end enfolded us!\nBut the god himself, I suppose, resented such a prospect,\nand denied a safe homecoming to that unlucky man alone.”\nSo he spoke, and stirred in them all an urge to lamentation:\nArgive Helen, daughter of Zeus, shed tears now,\nand Telemachos wept, as did Atreus’ son Menelaos,\nnor could the son of Nestor keep his eyes tearless, as he\nrecalled in his heart the peerless Antilochos,\nslain by the bright Dawn’s glorious son. So now,\nthinking of him, he uttered winged words, saying:\n“Son of Atreus, old Nestor would always refer to you as\nthe most sagacious of men, when your name came up\nin his halls, when questions arose between us: so now,\nif it’s possible, do me a favor! I’m not the sort of man\nto hold sad discussions at dinner: next morning’s soon enough\nfor that kind of thing. Of course, I’m not against\ngrieving for any mortal who’s died and met his fate:\nthis is the only due we pay to wretched mortals,\nto crop our hair, and let the tears course down our cheeks!\nFor a brother of mine, too, is dead, one far from the meanest\nof Argives—you may well have known him, though I myself\nnever met nor saw him: still, they say that Antilochos\nexcelled all others both as a runner and as a fighter.”\nThen fair-haired Menelaos responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, what you’ve said is all that any sagacious man\ncould say or do, even one who was older than you are!\nSuch a father is yours, as your careful speech makes clear.\nEasily known is the offspring of that man for whom\nKronos’ son spins good fortune in his marriage and his children,\nas now he has granted Nestor, through all his days,\nto reach old age at home in prosperity, with his sons\nproving themselves both sharp-witted and expert spearmen.\nSo we’ll leave off the weeping that recently took place,\nand let’s turn our minds back to dinner—let them pour water\nover our hands! Time enough tomorrow morning\nfor me and Telemachos to have a full discussion.”\nSo he spoke, and Asphalion poured water on their hands—\nAsphalion, busy squire of renowned Menelaos. They now\nreached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nThen Helen, daughter of Zeus, had another idea: at once\ninto the wine they were drinking she added a drug\nthat banishes grief and anger, brings oblivion of all ills:\nwhoever swallowed it when mixed into the bowl\nwould not, for the rest of that day, wet his cheeks with tears,\neven though his mother and father should lie there dead,\nor a brother or dear son should be killed in his presence,\ncut down by the sword, and his own eyes witnessed it—\nso powerful were the drugs that this daughter of Zeus possessed,\nbenign ones, a present from Thon’s wife Polydamna,\na native of Egypt; for there the grain-giving earth bears most\ndrugs—many healing in mixture, and many malignant:\neach man there’s a physician, more knowledgeable than all\nmankind elsewhere, for indeed they are of Paieon’s race.\nSo when she’d added the drug and had the wine poured out,\nat once she spoke again, and responded to them, saying:\n“Atreus’ son Menelaos, Zeus’ nursling, and you other sons\nof excellent sires! Now to one man, now to another\nthe god, Zeus, gives good or ill, for he can do anything; so\nfeast on, sitting here in our halls at your ease, and enjoy\nlistening to tales: I’ll tell one that fits this occasion well!\nI can’t rehearse or enumerate all the many trials\nof steadfast-minded Odysseus, but there is this one exploit,\nperformed and endured by the mighty warrior in\nthe Trojans’ land, where you Achaians endured troubles!\nHe scourged his own person with harsh unseemly blows,\nflung rags about his shoulders to look like a menial,\nand slipped into the enemy’s wide-wayed city,\nconcealing himself in the likeness of another, a beggar,\nquite different from the real man at the Achaians’ ships.\nThus disguised he entered the Trojans’ city, unrecognized\nby them all: I alone perceived who he really was,\nand questioned him; he in his cunning dodged my enquiries.\nBut after I’d bathed him and rubbed him down with oil,\nand put good clothes on him, and swore a mighty oath\nnot to reveal him as Odysseus among the Trojans\nuntil he was safely back to the swift ships and the huts,\nthen at last he told me all the plans of the Achaians;\nand—after he’d killed many Trojans with the keen-edged bronze—\ngot back to the Argives, brought them much information.\nThe other Trojan women wailed in grief, but my own\nspirit rejoiced, since already my heart was set to return\nback home, and I groaned for the blindness that Aphrodite\nhad inflicted in leading me there, away from my dear country,\nabandoning my own child, my bedchamber, my husband—\nwho was lacking in nothing, either brains or looks.”\nThen fair-haired Menelaos responded to her, saying:\n“All this indeed, my wife, you have stated correctly.\nLong since have I come to know the minds and counsel\nof many heroic men, and have traveled widely,\nbut never yet have I met and studied such a person\nas steadfast Odysseus was at heart; nor have I known\nso striking a deed as that great man devised and achieved\nin the carpentered Horse, where we—all the very best\nof the Argives—sat, bringing death and destiny\nto the Trojans. You came then—maybe impelled\nby a god determined to grant the Trojans some glory—\nand godlike Deiphobos along with you. Three times\nyou circled the hollow ambush, tapping its surface,\ncalling out to all the Danaan leaders by name,\nimitating the voice of each of the Argives’ wives.\nNow I and the son of Tydeus, with noble Odysseus,\nwere sitting inside, and could hear the way you were calling.\nDiomedes and I were both eager to jump from our seats\nand emerge, or at least to answer you from inside;\nbut Odysseus, despite our longing, held us back in place.\nThen all the Achaians’ sons kept silent except for\nAntiklos, who was still determined to answer you,\nhad not Odysseus kept his mouth firmly shut\nwith his great powerful hands, and saved all us Achaians\nby holding firm until Pallas Athene led you from us.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Atreus’ son Menelaos, Zeus’ nursling, leader of troops,\nso much the worse, for this didn’t ward off grim destruction\nfrom him, nor would have done, had his heart within been of iron!\nSo come now, dispatch us to bed, so that we without delay\nmay settle down and enjoy the pleasures of sweet sleep.”\nSo he spoke, and Argive Helen gave orders to her handmaids\nto set bedsteads under the colonnade, and lay upon them\nfine purple wool throws, and over these to spread blankets,\ntopped off with fleecy mantles that would serve as coverlets.\nOut from the hall went the handmaids, each holding a torch,\nand made up the beds. A herald escorted the guests.\nThey then lay down to sleep there, in the dwelling’s forecourt,\nthe hero Telemachos and Nestor’s splendid son;\nbut Atreus’ son slept in a back room of the high house,\nand by him lay long-robed Helen, resplendent among women.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nMenelaos of the great war cry rose from the bed he’d slept in,\nput on his clothes, slung a sharp sword from one shoulder,\ntied on a pair of sandals under his sleek feet,\nsallied forth from his chamber, in appearance like a god,\nsat down beside Telemachos, and addressed him as follows:\n‘What need was it brought you here, heroic Telemachos,\nto sunny Lakedaimon, over the broad back of the sea?\nSomething public, or personal? Tell me the truth of this.”\nSagacious Telemachos answered him: “Atreus’ son,\nMenelaos, Zeus’ nursling, leader of troops, I came\nin the hope you might be able to tell me news of my father.\nMy estate is being eaten up and my rich farms ruined,\nmy house is crowded with foes who continue to slaughter\nmy flocks of sheep and my crumple-horned shambling cattle—\nthese arrogant, overweening suitors of my mother!\nThat’s why I’m here at your knees now—you might be willing\nto tell me about his grim death, if you maybe saw it\nyourself, or heard an account of it from some other\nwanderer: to unmatched misery his mother bore him!\nAnd don’t, from concern or pity, speak false comfort to me,\nbut tell me exactly whatever you may have witnessed!\nI beseech you, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, made you\nany promise, by word or action, and delivered on it\nin the land of the Trojans, where you Achaians met grief,\nremember it now, and tell me the unerring truth of it.”\nDeeply troubled, fair-haired Menelaos now addressed him:\n“I tell you, it was indeed in the bed of a brave warrior\nthat these fellows, cowards themselves, hoped they might lie!\nAs when in a thicket, the lair of a powerful lion,\na doe has laid to sleep her newborn suckling fawns,\nand goes off, traversing foothills and grassy glens\nin search of pasture, and the lion returns to his den\nand on both her fawns unleashes a ghastly fate—just so\nwill Odysseus unleash a ghastly fate on these men!\nHow I wish—by Zeus the Father and Athene and Apollo!—\nthat he, as strong as he was that time in well-built Lesbos\nwhen he stood up and wrestled a bout with Philomeleides,\nand threw him down forcefully, and all the Achaians cheered,\nmight come—he, Odysseus—in such strength among these suitors!\nThen they’d all get a swift end and a bitter marriage!\nAs regards the business you’re enquiring about, I shan’t\nveer off onto other subjects, nor will I mislead you—\nof all that I heard from the forthright Old Man of the Sea\nnot one word will I keep back or conceal from you!\n“Though I longed to return here, the gods still held me back\nin Egypt, since I’d not offered them adequate sacrifices—\ngods always want mortals to bear their behests in mind!\nWell, there exists an island set in the surging sea,\noffshore from Egypt: Pharos, they call it, as far out\nas a hollow ship can cover in one whole day\nwith a tailwind strong and constant blowing behind it;\nthere’s a harbor there with good anchorage, where men\ntake on water before sailing out in their trim ships.\nThere for twenty days the gods stayed me, nor ever did\nthose maritime tailwinds show up that escort ships\nsafely across the sea’s broad back; so all my stores\nwould have been eaten up, and my crew’s strength with them,\nhad not one of the gods shown compassion and rescued me—\nthe daughter of mighty Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea,\nEidothee: it was her heart I’d stirred in particular when\nshe encountered me straying alone, far away from my comrades,\nwho’d gone out round the island, engaged in fishing\nwith bent hooks, since starvation was crimping their bellies.\nShe it was who approached now, and addressed me, saying:\n‘Are you just childish, stranger, excessively dim-witted,\nor deliberately acting the fool, out of pleasure in suffering?\nThe way you’re stuck on this island, unable to discover\nany way out, and your men near to despairing!’\n“So she spoke; and I then responded to her, saying:\n‘Let me tell you—whichever goddess it is that you are—\nthat no way am I stuck here by choice: it must be that\nI’ve trespassed against the immortals who hold wide heaven!\nSo tell me—for you gods have knowledge of everything—\nwhich immortal is keeping me here, holding up my journey,\nand how I’m to get back home, across the fish-rich sea.’\n“So I spoke, and at once she, bright among goddesses, said:\n‘Well, stranger, I’ll give you a full and accurate answer.\nThere’s a certain Old Man of the Sea—he often comes here—\nimmortal and truthful—Proteus of Egypt, who knows\nthe depths of every sea, a servant of Poseidon:\nthey say he’s my father, that he begot me. Now if\nyou could somehow lie in wait and get hold of him, then\nhe could tell you about your return, the details of your journey,\nall your long voyage homeward across the fish-rich sea.\nWhat’s more, Zeus’ nursling, if you wanted, he could relate\nwhat’s been done in your halls, for both good and evil,\nwhile you were away on your long and arduous journey.’\n“So she spoke, and I then made answer to her, saying:\n‘Show me yourself now how to ambush this old immortal—\nhe might see me beforehand, be alerted, avoid me:\nit’s hard for a mere mortal to overpower a god.’\n“So I spoke, and at once she, bright among goddesses, said:\n‘Well, stranger, I’ll give you a full and accurate answer.\nAt the time that the sun has risen to span mid-heaven\nthis truthful Old Man of the Sea emerges from the waves\nwith the breath of the west wind, concealed by a dark ripple.\nWhen he’s out, he lies down to sleep in the hollow caves,\nand around him the seals, the sweet sea daughter’s brood,\ncome up out of the grey sea water, fall asleep together,\nexhaling a pungent reek of the sea’s far-reaching depths.\nI’ll take you there tomorrow as dawn is breaking\nand settle you down in a row—you must carefully choose\nthree of your comrades, the best in your strong-benched ships—\nand tell you about all the tricks of the old man. First,\nhe’ll count the number of seals, go over them all;\nbut when he’s totted them up and reviewed them, then\nhe’ll bed down in the midst of them, like a shepherd among his flock.\nNow as soon as you see him settled, then will be the time\nto muster up every last drop of your strength and vigor,\nand hold him firm, though he’ll struggle mightily to escape.\nHe’ll test you by turning into every creature that comes forth\nand moves on the earth, into water, into devouring fire;\nyet keep him pinned down, hold on to him all the harder!\nBut when at last he questions you in his own person,\nin that shape he had when you watched him settling down,\nthen, hero, cease your violence, set the old man free,\nask him which of the gods it is that’s angry with you\nand your homecoming, how you’re to traverse the fish-rich sea.’\n“That said, she dived down into the surging deep,\nand I returned to my ships, drawn up on the beach,\nmy heart brooding darkly on many things as I went.\nThen, after we’d gone on down to our ship and the sea,\nand made ready our meal, and ambrosial night came on,\nwe lay down to sleep there, beside the breaking surf.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthen indeed along the strand of the broad-wayed sea\nI went, praying much to the gods, and taking with me\nthe three comrades I most trusted for every venture.\n“She meanwhile had plunged down into the sea’s broad gulf\nand fetched up from the deep the skins of four seals, all\nrecently flayed: she’d thought up a trick against her father.\nShe dug out hollow forms in the sandy beach, and sat there,\nwaiting. So we came right up to her, and she made us\nlie down in a row, threw a skin over each of us. Now\nour ambush would have been torture, for most horribly\ndid the vile stench of these brine-bred seals revolt us—\nwho’d choose to bed down beside a beast from the sea?—\nhad she herself not rescued us, devised a great remedy:\nshe brought and positioned ambrosia under each man’s nose,\nthat breathed sweet fragrance, destroying the sea beast’s stink.\nSo all that morning we waited, with enduring patience,\ntill the seals came crowding up from the water and then\nsettled themselves in lines along the seashore. At noon\nthe old man emerged from the sea, to find his well-nourished\nseals: he inspected them all and checked their number,\ncounting us first among the beasts, never once suspecting\nthe trick we’d played. Then he too lay down to rest.\nSo we with a shout sprang on him, locked him in our arms;\nBut the old man hadn’t forgotten his own elusive arts,\nfar from it: first he became a bearded lion,\nthen a serpent, then a leopard, then a gigantic boar;\nthen he turned into flowing water, and a tall leafy tree;\nbut with resolute heart we kept him firmly pinned down,\nand when the cunning old trickster was at last exhausted\nthen he finally spoke and questioned me, saying: ‘Which\nof the gods, son of Atreus, was it advised you how to ambush\nand catch me against my will? What is it that you want?’\n“So he spoke, and I then made answer to him, saying:\n‘You yourself know, old man—why try to trick me with\nthis question?—how long I’ve been stuck here on this island,\nunable to find a way out, my inner spirit fading: so you\ntell me—since gods are all-knowing—which immortal\nis it who fetters me here, who’s kept me from my journey—\nand how I’m to get back home across the fish-rich sea.’\n“So I spoke: he at once made answer to me, saying:\n‘You should have made rich sacrifices to Zeus and the other gods\nbefore embarking, to ensure your speedy return\nto your own country, voyaging over the wine-dark deep!\nFor it isn’t your fate to set eyes on your friends, or make it\nback to your well-set home and your ancestral country\nbefore you’ve once more been to the waters of Egypt’s\nheaven-fed river and offered ample sacrifices\nto the immortal gods who hold wide heaven: only\nthen, at last, will they grant you the journey that you desire.’\n“So he spoke; but the heart within me was shattered\nby his sending me back again to traverse the misty deep\nto Egypt, a lengthy and most wearisome journey.\nYet even so I still responded to him, saying:\n‘All this I shall do, old man, exactly as you bid me.\nBut come now, tell me this, give me a true report:\nDid all the Achaians get home with their ships, unharmed,\nall those Nestor and I left when we set out from Troy?\nOr did any die by some unkind fate on shipboard,\nor in their friends’ arms, after winding up the war?’\n“So I spoke: he at once made answer to me, saying:\n‘Son of Atreus, why ask me this? It’s not your business\nto know or search out my mind—nor do I think\nyou’ll long be tearless when you hear the full account!\nFor many of them perished, and many were left there,\nthough only two leaders of the bronze-corseleted Achaians\ndied when returning home, or in the war—you were there then!—\nand one may still be alive, held back out there on the deep.\nAias was done for, along with his long-oared vessels:\nfirst Poseidon drove him onto the massive rocks\nof Gyrai, yet rescued him, brought him safe from the sea;\nand he’d have escaped his fate, though hated by Athene,\nhad he not, infatuate, uttered a reckless boast, asserted\nthat it was in spite of the gods he’d escaped the sea’s\ngreat gulf, so that Poseidon, hearing his noisy bragging,\nat once took hold of the trident in his mighty fists\nand struck the rock face of Gyrai, split a part off.\nThe rock held firm, but the fragment where Aias was perched\nwhen he made his reckless boast crashed into the sea,\nbore him down with it into the boundless surging main,\nso he swallowed his fill of salt water, and thus perished.\n‘But your brother somehow escaped, eluded the death spirits\nwith his hollow ships: it was the lady Here who saved him.\nThen, when he was nearing Malea’s sheer promontory,\na strong gale took hold of him, carried him headlong\nover the fish-rich waters, groaning disconsolately,\nto the coast of that land where in time past Thyestes\nhad his abode, but now his son Aigisthos dwelt there.\nYet from this point too an unharmed return was shown him:\nThe gods changed the gale to a tailwind, and they got home.\nNow he, Agamemnon, rejoicing, set foot on his native soil,\nlaid hold of the earth and kissed it, a flood of warm tears\nstreamed down his face, so glad he was to see his homeland.\n‘But a watch at his lookout saw him, a man brought in\nand set there by crafty Aigisthos, who promised him a reward,\ntwo talents of gold: he’d been keeping watch for a year now\nin case he slipped past unseen, fierce valor not forgotten.\nNow the watchman went to the palace, informed the people’s\nshepherd: Aigisthos at once thought up a crafty scheme:\nhe chose twenty men, the best fighters in the region,\nand placed them in ambush, but across the hall laid on\na feast, then took horses and chariots to welcome Agamemnon,\nthe people’s shepherd, mind set on treacherous action,\nand brought him back, unaware of his coming fate, and after\nfeasting him killed him, the way you’d butcher an ox at its crib.\nNot one of all Atreus’ son’s comrades remained alive there,\nnot one of Aigisthos’ men: they all died in the halls.’\n“So he spoke, and the spirit within me was shattered.\nAnd I wept as I sat on the sand there, my heart no longer\nwanted to live, to behold the sunlight. But after\nI’d had my fill of weeping and groveling, then\nthe forthright Old Man of the Sea addressed me, saying:\n‘No longer, son of Atreus, waste time like this in ceaseless\nweeping: no good will come of it! Rather do all you can\nto get back soon to your country: there’s always a chance\nof finding that man alive still—if Orestes hasn’t arrived first\nand killed him, and you only get there in time for the funeral.’\n“So he spoke, and the heart and proud spirit once again\nwere cheered in my breast, despite the grief I felt,\nand I spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n‘These men I know of. But tell me, who’s the third man,\nthe one who may be alive still, held back out there on the main—\nor is he dead? Though it grieve me, I want to hear the truth.’\n“So I spoke: he at once made answer to me, saying:\n‘That is the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithake:\nhim I saw on an island, shedding copious tears,\nin the home of the nymph Kalypso, who by constraint\ndetains him there, so he can’t get back to his own country,\nfor he has no ships with oars, nor any comrades\nto further his voyage over the broad back of the sea.\nBut it isn’t your destiny, Menelaos, Zeus’ nursling,\nto die and meet your fate in horse-grazing Argos: rather\nit’s to the Elysian plain and the furthest ends of the earth\nthat the immortals will bring you, where fair-haired Rhadamanthys\ndwells, and where the living is easiest for mankind:\nno snow’s there, no strong storms, nor ever any rain,\nbut a constant light western breeze coming up off the ocean\nto provide mankind with cooling relief; for as they see it,\nsince you have Helen as wife, you’re a son-in-law of Zeus.’\n“That said, he plunged down into the surging deep;\nand I returned to the ships with my godlike comrades,\nmy heart brooding darkly on many things as I went.\nThen after we’d gone on down to our ship and the sea,\nand made ready our meal, and ambrosial night came on,\nwe lay down to sleep there, beside the breaking surf.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nour ships first of all we hauled into the bright salt sea,\nand set up the masts and sails in these well-trimmed vessels.\nThen the men went aboard, and sat down on the benches,\nand ranged in close order struck the grey sea with their oars.\nSo back to Egypt, land of the heaven-fed river, I brought\nand moored my vessels, and offered most lavish sacrifices;\nand when I’d appeased the wrath of the gods that are forever\nI raised Agamemnon a grave mound, that his fame might be\nundying. That done, I set sail for home. The immortals\ngave me a tailwind, conveyed me to my own dear land.\nSo come now, stay on with me longer here in my halls,\nfor eleven or twelve more days, and after that\nI’ll arrange you a proper send-off, with some splendid gifts—\nthree horses, a well-polished chariot. In addition\nI’ll give you a beautiful cup: then, when you pour libations\nto the deathless gods, you’ll remember me all your days.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Son of Atreus, please don’t invite me to stay here longer!\nTruth is, I’d be only too happy to sit on for a full year\nin your abode here, home and parents all forgotten,\nso rare is the pleasure I get from listening to your stories\nand the way you tell them! But already my comrades are fretting\nto leave sacred Pylos, you’re keeping me here so long!\nAs for the present you give me, make that a keepsake:\nhorses I’ll not take back to Ithake, but rather leave them\nhere for your pleasure, since you are lord of a spacious\nplain with an abundance of clover and galingale,\nof wheat and millet and ample-grained white barley.\nBut Ithake has no broad courses, nor any meadows; it gives\npasture to goats—more attractive than that for horses!\nNone of the islands has meadows or space for chariots:\neach of them slopes down seaward, Ithake most of all.”\nSo he spoke. Menelaos of the great war cry smiled,\ncaressed him with one hand, and addressed him, saying:\n“The way you talk, dear child, reveals your good breeding!\nI’ll change these presents, then, since I can: of all the gifts\nlaid away in my house as personal treasures I shall\ngive you the one that’s most beautiful and most costly:\na finely wrought mixing bowl, made all of silver throughout,\nrims finished off with a golden inlay, the work\nof Hephaistos, a present from the hero Phaidimos,\nthe Sidonians’ king, at the time that his house gave me shelter\nwhen I’d got that far homeward. This I’d like you to have.”\nSuch were the words they exchanged between one another,\nwhile the banqueters were arriving at the godlike king’s domain:\nthey drove up sheep, they brought beneficent wine,\ntheir fine-veiled wives came with them, carrying bread.\nThus they busied themselves about the feast in the halls.\nMeanwhile the suitors gathered in front of Odysseus’ abode\nwere amusing themselves, in their usual arrogant fashion,\nby throwing the discus and javelin out on a leveled terrace\nwhere Antinoos and godlike Eurymachos were sitting—\nthe suitors’ leaders, by far the best-born among them.\nThey were approached now by Phronios’ son Noemon,\nwho addressed Antinoos, had this question for him:\n“Antinoos, do we or don’t we know for certain when\nTelemachos will get back here from sandy Pylos? He went\ntaking a ship of mine, and now I have need of it\nto go over to widespread Elis, where I’ve a dozen\nbrood mares, now suckling young mules, unbroken, hard\nworkers: I want to drive one off, break it in.”\nSo he spoke. They were quietly astonished, had no idea\nthat Telemachos had gone to Neleian Pylos, believed him\nsomewhere out in the fields, with his flocks or at the swineherd’s.\nAntinoos, Eupeithes’ son, now responded to him, saying:\n“When exactly did he leave? And who were those young men\nthat went with him? Select Ithakans, or just his own\nfield hands and household servants? This too he could have done.\nAnd give me a true answer, I need to be quite certain:\nWas it by force, against your will, that he took your black ship,\nor did you give it him freely because he asked you for it?”\nNoemon, the son of Phronios, responded to him, saying:\n“I gave it him freely myself. What would anyone do\nwhen a man of his sort, with the troubles he has at heart,\nmade the request? To not give it him would be hard.\nAs for the youths, those gone with him are Ithake’s best\nafter ourselves: I noticed their leader embarking and he\nwas Mentor—or else some god who looked just like him.\nIt’s an odd thing: I saw godlike Mentor here yesterday\nat dawn, but in fact he’d left then in the ship to Pylos.”\nThis said, he took himself off to his father’s house,\nleaving the proud hearts of both highly disconcerted. They\nat once made the suitors quit their games and sit down,\nand among them Antinoos, Eupeithes’ son, now spoke,\nbitterly troubled, his black heart brimming over\nwith rage, while his eyes had the semblance of blazing fire.\n“An outrageous act, I swear, most high-handedly brought off,\nthis trip by Telemachos! And we thought he’d never make it!\nDespite all of us here, the brat’s gone, just like that—\ngot a ship, launched it, enrolled the best men we have!\nPretty soon he’ll be trouble for us: so may Zeus\ndestroy his power before he ever comes to full manhood!\nCome then, give me a fast ship and twenty comrades,\nso I can set an ambush, watch for him as he steers\nthrough the narrows between Ithake and sheer beetling Same,\nand give him a miserable voyage in his quest for his father!”\nSo he spoke: they all assented, backed his proposal,\ngot up at once, and went off to the house of Odysseus.\nNor was Penelope left for long without knowledge\nof the schemes that the suitors hatched in secret discussion,\nfor Medon the herald told her, who, outside the courtyard,\nheard the whole plot that they, inside, were weaving,\nand went in through the hall to inform Penelope of it.\nAs he set foot across the threshold Penelope addressed him:\n“Herald, for what have the lordly suitors now dispatched you?\nTo tell the household servants of godlike Odysseus\nto stop their appointed tasks, and cook up a feast for them?\nWould that this, with no prospect of future wooing or meetings\nelsewhere, were to be the last and latest dinner\nof all you who throng here, gobbling up so much livelihood,\nthe possessions of clever Telemachos! Did you not listen\nlong ago, when you were children, to your fathers’ talk\nof what manner of man Odysseus was among your begetters,\nwronging by deed or word no person in the land,\nunlike the custom of most of these godlike monarchs,\nwho hate one man and favor another as they please?\nBut he never ever treated anyone badly, whereas\nyour cast of mind and unseemly actions are all too clearly\nvisible, nor nowadays do past favors reap gratitude.”\nMedon, astute in counsel, then responded to her, saying:\n“My queen, would that this were the worst of all your troubles!\nBut there’s something else, more serious and threatening,\nthat the suitors are planning—Zeus forfend that it come to pass!\nThey intend to cut down Telemachos with the sharp bronze\non his way home—he sailed away, seeking news\nof his father, to sacred Pylos and lordly Lakedaimon.”\nSo he spoke. On the spot her knees and heart gave way,\nand for long she remained speechless. Both her eyes\nbrimmed over with tears, and her vigorous voice was stilled.\nBut at last she framed words again, and addressed him, saying:\n“Herald, why is my child gone? There was no need for him\nto go aboard swift-moving vessels that serve mankind\nas the sea’s horses, crossing wide stretches of the deep!\nIs not even his name to survive among mankind?”\nMedon, astute in counsel, responded to her, saying:\n“I do not know if some god incited him, or it was his own\nspirit stirred him to go to Pylos, to find out about\nhis father’s homecoming, or what fate he’d met.”\nWith that\nhe went on his way, out through Odysseus’ house; but she\nwas sunk in heart-crushing anguish, had no more strength\nto get herself to a chair, of the many in the room, but sank\ndown there, on her richly worked bedchamber’s threshold,\nsobbing piteously, and around her wailed her handmaids,\nall of them, young and old, that were there in the house.\nAfter much crying, Penelope now addressed them, saying:\n“Listen, my friends: on me the Olympian’s laid more grief\nthan any woman brought up with me has suffered! Years ago\nI lost my good husband: a lion’s heart he possessed,\nand stood out among the Danaans for every kind of virtue:\na fine man—wide is his fame through Hellas and mid-Argos!\nAnd now the gales have swept my beloved son away\nwithout trace from our home: I had no word of his going.\nYou cruel wretches, not one of you thought to arouse me\nfrom sleep, though you knew very well what was going on\nat the time that he went aboard that hollow black vessel!\nIf I’d only found out that he was planning this journey\nhe’d either have had to stay here, though longing to be gone,\nor else he’d have left me a corpse, here in my own halls!\nAs it is, will someone go quickly and summon old Dolios,\nmy servant, a gift from my father when first I came here,\nwho tends my orchard of fruit trees. He is to go at once,\nsit down beside Laertes, tell him all that’s happened—\nin the hope that Laertes will come up with some scheme,\npresent himself, lamenting, before these folk who are minded\nto do away with his stock, and that of godlike Odysseus.”\nEurykleia then, cherished nurse, responded to her, saying:\n“Dear girl, whether you finish me with the pitiless bronze\nor let me stay in the house here, I shan’t conceal the truth.\nI indeed knew all this, and gave him all he asked for—\nbread and sweet wine. But he made me swear a great oath\nnot to tell you for twelve days at least—or till you yourself\nmissed him, and heard that he’d gone—so that you would not\nfall to weeping, and spoil your lovely complexion. So now\ngo bathe yourself, and change into laundered clothes,\nand go upstairs to your room, you and your serving women,\nand pray to Athene, daughter of Zeus of the aegis: for she\nmight save him hereafter, even from death. But do not\nfurther burden that burdened old man—I can’t believe\nthat the line of Arkeisios’ son is wholly detested by\nthe blessed gods: there will surely still be an heir to possess\nhis high-roofed abode, his rich and distant fields.”\nSo speaking she lulled her grief, dried the tears from her eyes.\nPenelope went and bathed, changed into clean clothes,\nwent upstairs to her room, she and her serving women,\nput barley grain in a basket, then made her prayer to Athene:\n“Hear me, unwearying one, child of Zeus of the aegis!\nIf ever for you in his halls resourceful Odysseus made\nburnt sacrifice of fat thigh pieces of sheep or oxen,\nremember those offerings now, and save my dear son—\nfend off these suitors, so haughtily arrogant, from him!’\nSo saying, she keened aloud. The goddess heard her prayer.\nThe suitors meanwhile raised uproar throughout the shadowy halls,\nand this is the kind of remark that some arrogant youth would make:\n“There’s the much-courted queen deciding which of us she’ll wed—\nnot knowing that her son’s murder’s already been arranged!”\nSo would one speak; but they didn’t know what was arranged,\nor how, and Antinoos now addressed them, saying:\n“You idiots, avoid this kind of overconfident chatter\nentirely, lest someone report it to those inside!\nSo now let’s get going in silence, and put into action\nthe scheme that we all agreed to.”\nSo he spoke,\nand picked out the twenty best men: then they together\nset off to their swift ship on the strand by the seashore.\nFirst of all they hauled the black vessel down to deep water,\nthen they set up in it both mast and sail, and fitted\nthe oars to their leather thole-straps, all in due order,\nand hoisted and set the white sail. Meanwhile their proud\nattendants carried their gear aboard. They moored the vessel\nin deep enough water, then disembarked themselves,\nate their dinner, and waited for the approach of evening.\nBut she, the prudent Penelope, lay in her upper chamber\nwithout any nourishment, tasting neither food nor drink,\nwondering whether her blameless son would escape\ndeath or be done away with by the arrogant suitors;\nand just as a lion, when cornered by men, will deliberate\nin fear, as they close their deceptive circle around him,\nso was she worrying until sweet slumber overcame her,\nand she sank back and slept, and all her joints relaxed.\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another idea:\nshe made a phantom, in form resembling a woman—\nIphthime, the daughter of great-hearted Ikarios, whom\nEumelos married, he whose home was in Pherai—\nand sent it off to the home of godlike Odysseus, there\nto tell Penelope, who still was weeping and wailing,\nthat she should give over her grief, her tearful lamentation.\nInto her room it wafted, round the strap of the door bolt,\nand stood there above her head, and addressed her, saying:\n“Are you asleep, Penelope, heart still heavy with grief?\nThe gods, the easy livers, won’t have it that you should be\nweeping and grieving: return home is yet destined for your son,\nsince in the gods’ eyes he’s no kind of transgressor.”\nThen prudent Penelope made it this answer, as she\nslumbered on sweetly, ensconced at the gates of dreams:\n“Why have you come here, sister? Never until now\nwould you visit: the home you live in lies far away.\nAnd now you tell me to quit the grieving, the countless\nagonies that beset me in mind and soul! Years ago\nI lost my good husband: a lion’s heart he possessed,\nand stood out among the Danaans for every kind of virtue:\na fine man—wide is his fame through Hellas and mid-Argos!\nAnd now my beloved son, too, has left in a hollow ship—\na mere child, with no knowledge of hardship or public debate.\nFor him it is that I grieve, even more than for the other:\nI tremble for him, I’m afraid of what he might suffer\nin the land of those he’s gone to, or out on the deep sea.\nfor many ill-wishers are plotting against him, eager\nto kill him before he gets back to his own country.”\nIn answer to her the dark phantom now declared:\n“Take heart, don’t let your mind be overweighed by panic:\na guide goes with him such as other men have prayed\nto have at their side, since hers is indeed the power—\nPallas Athene! She feels compassion for you in your sorrow.\nand it’s she who has sent me here to bring you this message.”\nThen prudent Penelope made this reply to her, saying:\n“If you’re indeed a god, and have heard this word from the goddess,\nthen come tell me the truth about that man of sorrows—\ncan it be that he’s still alive, a witness to the sunlight,\nor is he already dead, and in Hades’ realm?”\nThe dark\nphantom then answered her in these words, saying: “No,\nabout him I shall tell you nothing plainly as to\nwhether he lives or is dead. A bad thing, windy chatter.”\nSo saying, it slipped out by way of the door bolt into\nthe draught of the winds. But she, Ikarios’ daughter,\nstarted up from her sleep, her heart greatly comforted\nthat so clear a dream had reached her in the dark of the night.\nNow the suitors embarked and sailed the watery routes,\nplotting sheer murder for Telemachos in their hearts.\nThere’s a rocky islet, Asteris, out in the midst of the deep,\nhalfway between Ithake and rugged Same, not large\nbut double-harbored, safe mooring for ships; and there\nthe Achaians set up an ambush, and waited for him.\n",

         "\nAs Dawn arose from her bed beside illustrious Tithonos,\nto bring light to the immortals and to mortal mankind,\nthe gods were taking their seats in assembly, and among them\nZeus the high-thunderer, whose power is the greatest.\nAthene was speaking, reminding them of Odysseus’ many woes,\nmuch concerned by his being in the nymph’s home: “Zeus,\nFather, and you other blessed gods who live forever,\nfrom now on let no kindness or gentleness be displayed\nby a sceptered king, let his heart not cherish righteousness—\nlet him rather be ever harsh, pursue injustice, since\nthere’s nobody now who remembers godlike Odysseus\nof the people whose lord he was, and kindly as a father!\nYet now he’s stuck on an island, suffering sore affliction\nin the nymph Kalypso’s abode: she is keeping him there\nunder duress. He cannot return to his own country,\nfor he hasn’t to hand any oared ships or companions\nto carry him on his way across the broad back of the sea;\nand now they’re determined to kill, on his journey homeward,\nhis beloved son, who’d gone, seeking news of his father,\nto sacred Pylos and to splendid Lakedaimon.”\nThen in answer cloud-gathering Zeus addressed her, saying:\n“My child, what’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth?\nDid not you yourself think up the scheme whereby\nOdysseus at his homecoming might be revenged on these men?\nAs for Telemachos, guide him skillfully—you can do this—\nso that he gets back unscathed to his native country\nand the suitors go home frustrated in their intentions.”\nThat said, he addressed himself to Hermes, his dear son:\n“Hermes, since in general matters you act as our messenger,\ngo inform the fair-haired nymph of my firm decision\nregarding the return of steadfast-minded Odysseus:\nhe’s to travel without the conveyance of gods or mortals,\non a tightly lashed raft, and enduring much hardship,\nmaking landfall, twenty days on, at rich-soiled Scheria,\ncountry of the Phaiakians, who are close kin to the gods.\nThey will honor him like a god, most heartily, and send him\naboard a ship of theirs to his own native country,\nwith generous gifts of bronze and gold and clothing,\nmore than Odysseus could ever have got for himself from Troy\nhad he, unscathed, brought home his fair share of the spoils.\nThis is how he’s fated to rejoin his own people, come back\nto his high-roofed abode and his own dear native land.”\nThe guide, the slayer of Argos, did not ignore his words.\nAt once beneath his feet he tied on the fine sandals,\nambrosial, golden, that carried him over the deep\nand the boundless earth, as swift as a gale’s blast;\nand he took the wand with which he entrances the eyes\nof those he so wills, while others he’ll wake from their sleep.\nHolding this, the strong Argos-slayer was airborne, flew\nfrom the high sky over Pieria, swooped down on the sea,\nthen skimmed over the waves like a shearwater that flies\nalong the fearsome gulfs of the unharvested deep\nhunting for fish, and wets its whirring wings in the brine—\njust so did Hermes traverse that expanse of waves\nuntil he finally reached the far-distant island.\nThen he abandoned the violet deep for dry land,\nmade his way to the great cave where the fair-tressed nymph\nhad her abode, and found her at home. A great fire\nwas ablaze on the hearth: the fragrance of split cedar\nand citron wood burning spread far over the island,\nwhile she, within there, singing in a sweet voice,\nwent to and fro at the loom, wove with a golden shuttle.\nAround the cave there flourished woodland in abundance—\nalder, black poplar, and fragrant cypress—in which\nspread-winged birds had fashioned their nesting places:\nsmall horned owls, falcons, and those chattering seabirds,\ncormorants, that busy themselves far out in deep water.\nEncircling the hollow cavern there trailed a luxuriant\ngarden vine, with plentiful ripe grape clusters\nand four springs in a row, all gushing forth clear water,\nclose to each other, yet facing in different directions,\nand beyond them soft meadows of blossoming violets\nand celery: whoever might come there—an immortal, even—\nwould admire the sight, and rejoice in his heart, as now\nthe guide, the slayer of Argos, stared in admiration. But when\nin his heart he’d admired and marveled at everything, then\nhe made his way straight into the spacious cave; nor did she,\nKalypso, bright goddess, fail to know him when they met,\nfor gods, being immortal, are not strangers to each other,\neven though one may dwell in a home that’s far away.\nBut great-hearted Odysseus he did not find within there,\nfor he, as usual, was seated out on the seashore, weeping,\nrending his heart with tears and groans and sadness,\ngazing out through his tears at the unharvested sea.\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, now questioned Hermes,\nafter settling him down on a brightly gleaming chair:\n“Why, golden-staffed Hermes, honored and welcome, are you\nnow visiting me? In the past you’ve seldom come here.\nSay what you want: my heart tells me to do it\nif do it I can, and it’s something that can be done.\nBut come with me now, let me offer you entertainment.”\nSo saying, the goddess placed before him a table on which\nshe’d set out ambrosia, and mixed the red nectar for him.\nSo he ate and drank, did the guide, the slayer of Argos;\nthen, when he’d eaten and stayed his appetite with food,\nin response to her question he addressed her as follows:\n“Why am I here, you ask me, as goddess to god: I’ll give you\na full and truthful account, since that is your desire.\nZeus it was told me to come here: I didn’t want to.\nWho would willingly traverse so much salt water,\nan expanse past telling, with no city of mortals near it,\nmen who honor the gods with lavish sacrifices?\nBut no way can another god negate or circumvent\nwhat Zeus the aegis bearer has set his mind to!\nHe says there’s a man here with you, one more ill-starred\nthan all other warriors who round about Priam’s city\nbattled on for nine years; then in the tenth they sacked it\nand set off back home, but returning offended Athene,\nwho sent against them a foul storm and surging waves.\nThen all the rest of his noble companions perished,\nbut him the wind and waves bore off and carried hither,\nand him Zeus now bids you with all speed send on his way,\nsince he’s not fated to die here, far from his dear ones,\nbut it’s still his lot to see his friends and come home\nto his high-roofed house and his own dear native land.”\nSo he spoke; and Kalypso, bright among goddesses, shivered,\nand responded to him with winged words, saying: “Hard-hearted\nare you gods indeed, and jealous beyond all others,\nwho resent any goddesses sleeping with mortal men\nopenly, if they choose one such as their bedfellow!\nSo it was when rose-fingered Dawn took up with Orion—\nyou easy-living gods resented it, till at last\nin Ortygie chaste Artemis, she of the golden throne,\nwith her painless arrows assailed and killed him; so it was\nwhen fine-tressed Demeter went with Iasion, gave in\nto her passion, lay down and mingled with him\nin thrice-plowed fallow soil; not long was it before\nZeus learned of it and with his bright bolt hit and slew him.\nSo now too, gods, you resent my having a mortal companion.\nHim I saved when he was riding astride the keel,\nalone, after Zeus with his bright bolt had struck\nand shattered his swift ship out on the wine-dark sea:\nThen all the rest of his noble companions perished,\nbut him the wind and waves bore off and carried hither.\nTo him I gave friendly welcome and comfort, telling him\nI would make him immortal and ageless all his days. But since\nthere’s no way for another god to negate or circumvent\nwhat Zeus the aegis bearer has set his mind to,\nlet him go, if that’s what he has decided and so commands,\nacross the unharvested sea! But no way shall I dispatch him,\nfor I have here no oared ships, nor the crews for them,\nto send him on his way across the broad back of the sea.\nStill, I’ll be glad to advise him, I’ll hold back nothing,\nto help him get back unharmed to his own country.”\nThen the guide, the slayer of Argos, responded to her, saying:\n“So dispatch him now, and beware of the wrath of Zeus,\nlest he nurse resentment and rage against you later.”\nSo saying, the mighty slayer of Argos now departed,\nand she, the queenly nymph, went to great-hearted\nOdysseus, after hearing the message Zeus had sent her.\nHim she found on the seashore, sitting; nor were his eyes\never wiped dry of tears; sweet life was draining from him\nas he yearned to be home, since the nymph no longer pleased him.\nNights indeed he would sleep beside her perforce\nin the hollow caverns, the reluctant by the eager,\nbut all day he’d stay seated there on the stony beach,\nrending his heart with tears and sighs and sorrows,\nand wept as he gazed out over the unharvested deep. Now she,\nbright among goddesses, stood close and addressed him, saying:\n“Ill-fated man, I beg you, weep here no longer, don’t let\nyour life go to waste: I’m now ready to send you on your way!\nCome, hew long timbers with the bronze, and shape them\ninto a broad-beamed raft, fasten deck planks upon its\ntopside, to carry you over the misty deep; and I\nwill stow in it bread and water and bright red wine,\nheart-strengthening stuff, to fend off hunger from you;\nand I’ll clothe you well, and send you a good tailwind,\nto let you get back unharmed to your own country—\nthat’s if the gods wish it, they who hold the broad heavens,\nand are stronger than I am both to plan and accomplish.”\nSo she spoke, and noble much-enduring Odysseus shivered,\nand then responded to her with winged words, saying:\n“You’re planning some other thing, goddess, not my dispatch!\nOn a raft you’re bidding me cross the sea’s great gulf,\na fearful and perilous venture! Not even the best vessels,\ntrim and swift, always make it, even when given a tailwind\nby Zeus! I’ll not board any raft without your declared goodwill,\nunless you, goddess, agree to swear a mighty oath that this\nisn’t some bad new trick that you’re devising against me.”\nSo he spoke; but Kalypso bright among goddesses, smiled,\nand stroked him with her hand, and addressed him, saying:\n“What a rogue you are, and by no means feeble-minded,\nthat it occurred to you to address me in those terms!\nVery well: let earth bear witness, and the wide heaven above,\nand the cascade of Styx, the greatest and most dread\nof all oaths observed and taken among the blessed gods,\nthat this is no bad new trick that I’m plotting against you;\nno, my plans and considerations are such as I’d devise\nfor my own personal use, should such a need come on me.\nMy intentions are good, and the heart within my breast\nis not made of iron, but compassionate.”\nWith those words\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, went on ahead,\nat a brisk pace, and he followed in the goddess’ footsteps.\nThey came to the hollow cavern, goddess and man together,\nand there he settled himself on the same chair from which\nHermes had risen, while the nymph set all kinds of food\nbefore him to eat and drink, such stuff as mortals feed on,\nand she herself sat down facing godlike Odysseus,\nand her handmaids brought out for her ambrosia and nectar.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, was the first to speak:\n“Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, most resourceful Odysseus,\nare you really so set on making your way back home\nto your own land at once? Yet I wish you well regardless!\nIf you only knew in your heart the full measure of trouble\nit’s your fate to incur before you reach your homeland,\nyou’d rather stay here with me, and keep this house,\nand be immortal, despite your longing to see\nyour wife, whom you pine for always, day in, day out!\nI may indeed rightly claim not to be her inferior\nin either figure or stature, since no way is it seemly\nfor mortal women to rival a goddess in form or beauty.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n“Don’t resent this, my lady goddess: I myself know well\nthat prudent Penelope is in every way less striking\nin appearance than you, whether for stature or beauty,\nsince she’s a mortal woman, whereas you’re immortal, ageless!\nYet even so what I want and yearn for all my days\nIs to make it back home, to see the day of my returning!\nThough some god may wreck me again on the wine-dark deep,\nI will endure: the heart in my breast can bear much trouble!\nBefore now I’ve suffered much, have labored greatly\namid waves and in warfare: to all that let this be added.”\nSo he spoke: the sun went down, and darkness came on.\nThey repaired to the inmost recess of the hollow cavern\nand made love with pleasure, clasping each other close.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nOdysseus promptly put on a tunic and cloak, while she,\nthe nymph, also dressed herself in a long white robe,\nfine-textured and beautiful, with an exquisite golden sash\nabout her waist, and placed a veil on her head. She then\nbegan to plan the dispatch of great-hearted Odysseus. First\nshe brought him a large axe, well fitted to his grasp,\nof bronze, sharp, double-bladed, with its splendid\nhandle of olive wood firmly attached. She also\ngave him a finely made adze. Then she led the way\nto the far end of the island, where there stood tall trees—\nalder and poplar, and fir that reached sky-high,\ndried out and seasoned, that would ride for him buoyantly.\nBut when she had shown him where the tall trees grew,\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, went back home, while he\nset himself to fell timber. The work progressed apace:\ntwenty trees he felled, and trimmed them with the bronze,\nthen skillfully smoothed them, made them true to the line.\nNow Kalypso, bright among goddesses, brought him augers:\nhe bored through all the timbers, fitted them to each other,\nforced home and matched the joints, made them secure\nwith tree nails. Just as wide as the curve of the hull\nthat a skillful shipwright marks off for a broad-beamed freighter\nwas the width that Odysseus gave his raft. He fitted\ndeck beams in, matched them firm to the close-set ribs,\nworking away, and finished with lengthy gunwales.\nNext he set up a mast and attached a yardarm to it,\nand fashioned a steering oar with which to set his course.\nThen he fenced the raft overall with osier wattles,\nagainst the waves, and added a bed of brushwood dunnage.\nKalypso meanwhile, bright among goddesses, brought him\ncloth to fashion a sail from: this too he did with skill,\nand added tackle—braces and sheets and halyards—\nand used levers to shift the raft down to the bright salt deep.\nIt was now the fourth day, and all his work was finished.\nOn the fifth, bright Kalypso saw him off from the island\nwhen she’d bathed him and dressed him in fresh-scented garments.\nOn the raft the goddess put one skin of dark wine,\nand another, a large one, of water, along with provisions\nin a leather bag—cooked meat in plenty to boost his strength—\nand raised a good following wind, warm and propitious.\nHappily then to the breeze did noble Odysseus spread\nhis sail as he sat at the steering oar and skillfully\nmarked off his course; nor did sleep fall upon his eyelids\nas he steadily watched the Pleiades and late-setting Bootes\nand the Bear, which men also know as the Wagon, that circles\nin the place where it is, and keeps one eye on Orion,\nand alone never dips below the baths of Ocean.\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, had instructed him\nto keep this star on his left hand as he traversed the deep.\nFor seventeen days he sailed on over the sea, and on\nthe eighteenth there showed up the shadowy mountains\nof the Phaiakians’ land, where it came closest to him,\nresembling a shield laid out on the misty sea.\nBut the mighty Earth-Shaker, coming back from the Aithiopians,\nsaw him far off, from the Solymoi’s mountains, visible\nsailing over the deep, and waxed wrathful at the sight,\nand shook his head, and thus communed with himself:\n“Damn it, the gods have certainly changed their minds\nas regards Odysseus while I was away with the Aithiopians!\nNow he’s near the Phaiakians’ land, where it’s his destiny\nto escape the great crisis of suffering that’s come on him.\nEven so, I think I’ll yet give him his fill of trouble!”\nSo saying he gathered the clouds, and roiled up the deep,\nwielding his trident; he urged on to gale force every last\nwind in existence, he used the clouds to blot out\nboth land and sea: nightfall dropped down from heaven,\nthe east, south, and fierce west winds now drove together,\nwhile the skyborne north wind rolled a huge wave before it,\nand Odysseus’ knees and heart gave way, and deeply\nshaken he now addressed his own great-hearted spirit:\n“Ah, wretch that I am, what’s my ultimate fate to be?\nAll that the goddess told me, I fear, is true—\nshe said that out on the deep, before I reached my homeland\nI’d get my fill of trouble, and now it’s all happening!\nLook at the clouds with which Zeus is obscuring the wide\nheavens, the way he’s roiled up the sea, how the blasts\nof all the winds drive at me! Now my sheer destruction’s\nfor certain! Thrice and four times blessed those Danaans\nwho perished in Troy’s broad land, bringing aid to Atreus’ sons:\nHow I wish I too had died then, had met my fate that day\nwhen a mass of Trojans pelted me with their bronze-tipped spears,\nbattling around the dead son of Peleus! Then\nI’d have had proper burial, and from the Achaians renown:\nwhereas now I’m doomed to suffer a most piteous death.”\nAs he spoke, a huge wave bore down on him from above,\nwith fearful force, and spun his raft clean around:\nfar from the raft he fell, the steering oar was torn\nfrom his grasp, the mast cracked in two, hit squarely\nby a gale-force gust from the winds in wild confusion,\nso that sail and yardarm fell far off into the deep.\nHim the sea long kept submerged, nor was he able\nto come up at once from the great wave’s onrush: the clothes\nthat bright Kalypso had given him weighed him down.\nHe finally reached the surface, spat out the briny\nsea water that streamed off his head; yet not even so,\nfor all his exhaustion, did he lose sight of his raft,\nbut pursued it amid the waves, somehow caught hold of it,\nand clambered aboard and clung there, evading death’s end,\nwhile the great seas bore it onward, this way and that.\nAs when in autumn the north wind blows thistledown\nover the plain, and the tufts cling close together,\nso hither and thither the winds now carried the raft\nover the sea: now south wind would toss it to north\nto sweep onward, now east would yield it to west’s pursuit.\nBut Kadmos’ daughter caught sight of him, neat-ankled Ino,\nwhite goddess, who once was a mortal, and so spoke,\nbut now in the sea’s depths had found honor from the gods.\nShe pitied Odysseus, so sea-tossed, so racked with troubles,\nmade her way up like a shearwater from the depths, then perched\non the strongly corded raft, and addressed him, saying:\n“Poor man, why, pray, does Poseidon the Earth-Shaker\nhate you so much that he afflicts you with all these troubles?\nYet despite his fury he shan’t completely destroy you!\nNow: do as I tell you: you seem not lacking in common sense.\nStrip off those clothes, leave your raft for the winds to play with,\nand yourself use your arms as a swimmer, strive to make it\nto the Phaiakians’ land, where your escape is destined!\nAnd come, take this veil, bind it firmly about your body:\nIt’s immortal, so have no fear that you’ll come to harm, or perish!\nBut when your hands grasp the mainland, then untie it\nand fling it far out into the wine-dark deep,\nwell away from the land, and yourself turn your back on it.”\nSo saying, the goddess handed over the veil,\nand herself plunged back down into the surging deep\nlike a shearwater: the dark wave hid her. Then noble\nmuch-enduring Odysseus reflected, and, deeply shaken,\nnow addressed his own great-hearted spirit, saying:\n“Alas, I fear some immortal is once more weaving a snare\nagainst me, and that’s why she told me to leave the raft!\nI’ll not obey her yet: with my own eyes I saw, far distant,\nthat land where she said I’d find my destined safety.\nThis is what I shall do, and to me it seems my best course:\nSo long as the timbers hold firm, their joints unbroken,\nI shall stay put, and endure the troubles that I’m facing;\nBut when the waves have shattered the raft to pieces\nthen I’ll swim for it, since there’s no better plan.”\nWhile thus\nhe pondered the matter in mind and heart, Poseidon,\nthe Earth-Shaker, now conjured up a gigantic wave—\nfearsome and grim, overarching—and launched it at him.\nAs when a gusting wind whisks up a heap of dried-out\nhusks, and scatters some here, some there, just so\nthe wave strewed the raft’s long timbers; and now Odysseus\nsat astride one beam, like someone riding a horse,\nstripped off the garments that bright Kalypso gave him,\nquickly tied round his body the veil, and flung himself\nheadfirst into the sea, both arms outstretched, prepared\nto swim for his life. The mighty Earth-Shaker saw him,\nand shook his head, and thus communed with his heart:\n“So, after all your troubles, go drifting over the deep\nuntil you meet with those men who are Zeus’ nurslings!\nYet even so I don’t think you’ll underrate your hardships.”\nSo saying, he whipped up his beautifully maned horses\nand went on to Aigai, where he has his famed abode.\nBut Zeus’ daughter Athene had a different notion:\nthe other winds she now stopped short in their tracks,\nmade them all die down and be lulled to sleep, but the swift\nnorth wind she aroused, parting the waves before it,\nto let Zeus’ scion Odysseus get through to the oar-loving\nPhaiakians, after escaping death and death’s harbingers.\nTwo nights and two days now over the heaving swell\nhe pressed on: many times his heart saw destruction ahead.\nBut when fair-haired Dawn brought the third morning on,\nthen the wind dropped, and there followed a windless calm,\nand he sighted land close ahead of him, as he took\na quick glance forward, lifted up by a swelling wave.\nAs most welcome appear to his children renewed signs of life\nin a father who’s laid on a sickbed, suffering agonies,\nlong wasting away, attacked by some hateful spirit,\nbut then, oh joy, the gods free him from his illness—\nso welcome seemed to Odysseus the land and its forest,\nand he swam on, longing to set foot on solid earth.\nBut when as close to land as a man’s shout carries,\nhearing the crash of the breakers against the reefs—\nfor the huge wave thundered as it smashed into dry land,\nroaring terribly: all around was misted in salt sea spray,\nand there were no harbors to dock ships, no roadsteads either,\nnothing but jutting headlands, and reefs and rocks—\nthen the knees and heart of Odysseus gave way together,\nand deeply shaken he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:\n“Oh no, now Zeus has granted me an unlooked-for\nglimpse of dry land, and I’ve plowed my way through this gulf,\nno way of escape can I see from the grey brine, for offshore\nare sharp rocks, and all around them the waves surge up\nroaring, the cliff-face towers sheer above them; the seawater\nruns deep close in to land, so there’s no way to stand firm\non both feet and escape destruction: I fear as I’m coming ashore\nsome huge wave may scoop me up and dash me against\na sharp rough rock, putting paid to all my efforts.\nBut if I swim further along, to see if I maybe can find\nbays where the waves strike aslant, or safe harbors from the sea,\nI’m afraid that the storm winds may snatch me up once more,\nand bear me back, groaning heavily, over the fish-rich deep,\nor a marine divinity may send some huge monster against me\nout of the sea, one of many that famed Amphitrite breeds—\nfor I know how deeply the famed Earth-Shaker hates me.”\nWhile he brooded upon these matters in mind and spirit\na great wave flung him forward against the rocky shoreline.\nThere would his bones have been crushed and his skin ripped off\nhad not grey-eyed Athene, the goddess, put a thought in his mind:\nwith both hands, plunging forward, he seized the rock,\nand clung to it, gasping, while the great wave rushed by.\nThus this one he dodged, but its backwash caught and struck him\nand carried him off, flung him far out to sea.\nJust as an octopus, when dragged up out of its lair,\nwill have clusters of pebbles sticking fast to its suckers,\nso from his powerful hands against the rock were scraps\nof skin stripped off as the great wave went over him.\nBeyond his fate, then, surely would wretched Odysseus\nhave died, had not grey-eyed Athene sharpened his wits.\nComing up out of the surge as it discharged on the shore\nhe swam outside, eyeing the land, to see if he could find\nbays where the waves struck aslant, or safe harbors from the sea.\nBut when, as he swam, he came on the mouth of a flowing\nriver, this struck him as the best possible place,\nbeing free of stones, and well sheltered from the wind.\nHe recognized the live current, and made a silent prayer:\n“Hear me, lord, whoever you are, and to me most welcome:\nfrom the deep I come to you, fleeing Poseidon’s threats—\nSacrosanct, even to the immortal gods, is that man\nwho comes as a wanderer, as I come now to your\ncurrent, and to your knees, after many hardships:\nSo pity me, lord: your suppliant I hereby declare myself.”\nThus he spoke; at once the god stopped flowing, checked the waves,\ncreated a calm before him, brought him safe and sound\nto the river’s mouth. Both knees now lost their strength\nand his strong hands too: the salt deep had crushed his spirit,\nall his flesh was swollen, seawater oozed in streams\nout through his mouth and nostrils. Breathless, speechless\nhe lay, barely stirring: dire exhaustion had overcome him.\nWhen he got his breath back, and the heart revived in his breast,\nhe then unwound the goddess’ veil from his body\nand dropped it into the seaward-flowing river. A great\nwave now carried it back downstream, and Ino quickly\ngathered it into her hands. Odysseus turned from the river,\ncollapsed in the reeds, and kissed the grain-giving earth.\nDeeply shaken he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:\n“Ah, what must I suffer? What’s my ultimate fate to be?\nIf I keep watch here by the river all the irksome night\nI’m afraid the hard frost and the chilly dew between them,\nbecause of my weakness, may quell my gasping spirit—\nand the breeze off the river blows cold before the dawn.\nBut if I climb the slope to the shadowy forest\nand lie down among the dense thickets, then even if cold\nand exhaustion don’t touch me, and I enjoy sweet sleep,\nI fear I may end as the spoil and prey of wild beasts.”\nAs he reflected, it struck him this last was the best course.\nHe set off into the maquis and found what he wanted near\nthe water, beside a clearing. He crept in under two bushes,\nevergreen thorn and wild olive, that grew from the same spot.\nThrough these the damp winds’ violence could never blow,\nnor the rays of the bright sun penetrate, nor storms\nof rain pierce their defenses, so densely they grew,\ninterlaced the one with the other. In under these\nOdysseus crept, and with his hands briskly swept\na wide bed of leaves together. Dried fallen leaves were there\nin abundance, enough to give shelter to two or three men\nin the winter season, however severe the weather.\nSeeing this, much-enduring noble Odysseus rejoiced:\nhe lay down in the middle, heaped fallen leaves over him.\nAs a man hides a smoldering log under dark embers\nfar out in the countryside, a man who has no neighbors,\nto save a seed of fire, and not need to rekindle it,\nso Odysseus piled leaves over himself, and Athene\nshed sleep on his eyes, to free him as soon as might be\nfrom toilsome exhaustion, wrap his eyelids in darkness.\n",

         "\nSo Odysseus slept on there, godlike and much-enduring,\nworn out by exhaustion and hardship; and meanwhile Athene\nwent off to the district and city of the Phaiakians, who\nat one time made their home in spacious Hypereia,\nand were neighbors to the Kyklopes, rough arrogant men,\nwho kept raiding them, and were more powerful. Godlike\nNausithoos then uprooted them, led them to Scheria,\nremote from bread-eating mortals, settled them there.\nHe ran a wall round the city, constructed houses,\nmade shrines for the gods, shared out the arable acres.\nBut by now he’d succumbed to his fate, gone down to Hades,\nand Alkinoos was the ruler, who had wisdom from the gods.\nTo his dwelling now went the goddess, grey-eyed Athene,\nwith her plan for great-hearted Odysseus’ return home.\nShe entered the ornate bedroom in which there slept a girl\nmost like the immortals in form and appearance: Nausikaa,\ndaughter of great-hearted Alkinoos, with close by her\ntwo handmaids, made beautiful by the Graces, one on each\nside of the doorposts; and the bright doors were shut.\nLike a breath of wind she now swept in to the girl’s bedside,\nand stood above her head, and addressed her, assuming\nthe form of the daughter of Dymas, famous for his ships—\na girl Nausikaa’s age, and very dear to her heart.\nIn her likeness grey-eyed Athene spoke to her, saying:\n“Nausikaa, how could your mother have so careless a child?\nYour bright smart clothes are all lying about uncared-for,\nyet your marriage is near, when you’ll need fine clothes for yourself,\nand garments, too, to provide for those who’ll escort you.\nThis is the kind of thing that gets you well spoken of\namong men, and pleases your father and lady mother!\nSo let’s go and do the washing tomorrow at daybreak:\nI’ll come with you as helper, let you make yourself ready\nas soon as may be: you won’t be unmarried much longer!\nAlready suitors are courting you, the noblest Phaiakians\nin these parts—and you share their lineage! So come now,\nurge your far-famed father, first thing this morning,\nto have mules and a wagon ready, to carry for you\nthe sashes and robes and bright coverlets. And for yourself\nit’s much better to travel this way than to go by foot:\nthe washing troughs are a long way distant from the city.”\nThat said, the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, departed\nfor Olympos, where, they say, the gods have their abode\nforever immovable, never shaken by gales nor wet\nwith rain, nor does snow ever visit them; the sky\nstretches dazzling and cloudless, the upper air gleams white.\nThe blessed gods find enjoyment here all their days,\nand here the grey-eyed one went, after speaking with the girl.\nNow Dawn on her fine throne arrived, and woke up the latter,\nthe finely robed Nausikaa. She at once, amazed by her dream,\nwent off through the house to report it to her parents,\nher own dear father and mother. She found them in:\nher mother sitting there at the hearth with her handmaids,\nspinning sea-purple yarn on a distaff; her father she caught\non the point of leaving to join the distinguished elders\nin council, summoned there by the lords of Phaiakia.\nShe went up to her dear father, and addressed him thus:\n“Dear Papa, won’t you please have a wagon made ready for me—\nthe high one, with good wheels, so I can take the fine\nclothes that are lying here soiled to the river for washing?\nFor you too it’s proper, when you’re with the chief men\ndebating in council, to be wearing fresh-laundered clothes,\nand you’ve five sons living with you, here in your halls,\ntwo married, but three lively bachelors, who always\ninsist on having fresh-laundered clothes to put on\nfor going to the dance: all this now needs my attention.”\nSo she spoke, too embarrassed to mention lusty marriage\nto her father; but he understood all, and responded, saying:\n“I begrudge you neither the mules, child, nor anything else,\nso off you go: the servants will ready the wagon for you—\nthe high one, with good wheels, and fitted bodywork.”\nWith that he called to the servants, and they obeyed him.\nThey made ready the good-wheeled mule wagon outside,\nand brought the mules, and yoked and harnessed them,\nwhile the girl fetched out the bright garments from indoors,\nand stowed them away in the polished cart, and her mother\nadded a box full of satisfying things to eat—\nappetizers galore, and poured out a measure of wine\nin a goatskin bottle. Nausikaa boarded the wagon,\nand her mother gave her a golden flask full of soft oil, with which\nshe and her handmaids could massage themselves. She now\ntook hold of the whip and the brightly polished reins,\nand whipped up the mules to start them. They clattered off\nat a smart trot, not pausing, with girl and laundry aboard—\nnot alone, for her handmaids all came along with her.\nWhen they reached the sweet flow of the river, at the site\nof the regular wash troughs—always enough clean water\nfrom springs there or outflow to clean the dirtiest garments—\nthen they unhitched the mules, set them free from the wagon,\nand shooed them off along the bank of the eddying river\nto graze on honey-sweet clover, while they themselves\ntook armfuls of clothes from the wagon to the dark water\nand trod them out in the basins, fast-moving, competitive.\nThen after they’d washed them and got them clean again\nthey spread them in rows on the shoreline, where the surf\nbeating upon the strand had most clearly scoured the pebbles.\nThen they bathed, and rubbed themselves down with oil,\nand ate their lunch beside the banks of the river\nwhile waiting until the clothes dried off in the bright sunlight.\nWhen the handmaids and Nausikaa had eaten their fill\nthey then threw off their veils and turned to playing ball,\nand white-armed Nausikaa was their leader as they sang.\nJust as the archer Artemis roams across mountain ranges—\nlofty Taygetos, say, or Erymanthos—exulting\nin her pursuit of wild boar or of the swift-footed deer,\nand country nymphs, daughters of Zeus the aegis bearer,\njoin the sport with her, and Leto rejoices at the sight\nof Artemis, head and brow higher than all the others,\nand easily recognized, though each one is beautiful:\nso amid all her handmaids shone out this unwed maiden.\nBut when she was on the point of starting back homeward,\nwith the mules yoked up and the fine clothes folded, then\nthe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another idea:\nthat Odysseus should wake, and see the sweet-faced girl,\nand that she should escort him to the Phaiakians’ city.\nSo when the princess next tossed the ball to a handmaid\nshe missed the handmaid, and sent it into a deep eddy.\nThey all cried out at length, and noble Odysseus awoke,\nand sat up, wondering in his mind and heart: “Ah me,\namong what sort of mortals have I now made landfall?\nAre they wild and outrageous, men with no sense of justice,\nor hospitable to strangers, a god-fearing people? An outcry\nof women—young girls—just echoed round about me:\nthe nymphs, it could be, who haunt the sheer mountain peaks\nand the rivers’ springs and the grassy meadows! Or am I\nsomewhere near talking humans? Well, come on now,\nlet me take a look for myself, see what I can discover.”\nThat said, godlike Odysseus came out from under the bushes.\nStrong-handed, he broke off a leafy branch from the dense\nmaquis to cover his body, hide the male parts. He came forth\nlike some mountain-bred lion, confident in his strength,\nwho, beaten by wind and rain, still advances, both his eyes\nablaze, as in among cattle or sheep he hastens, or in\npursuit of wild deer: his ravenous belly drives him\nto go after the flocks even inside the close-walled farmstead.\nSo Odysseus was set to mingle, though naked, among these\nfair-tressed young girls: such need had come upon him.\nA terrifying sight they found him, all crusted with dried brine,\nand they scattered in panic around the jutting sand-spits.\nAlkinoos’ daughter alone stood firm, for Athene had put\ncourage into her heart, and purged the fear from her limbs.\nShe stood still, holding her ground. Odysseus debated—should he\nclasp the knees of this good-looking girl when making his plea,\nor should he stay put, just cajole her with honey-sweet phrases\nso she’d give him clothes, show him the way into town?\nAs he thus reflected, he decided that it would be better\nto stay put, just cajole her with honey-sweet phrases—\nthe girl might take offense if he grabbed her knees!\nSo he made an impromptu speech, both honey-sweet and crafty:\n“By your knees I entreat you, lady—some goddess are you,\nor mortal? If a goddess, one of those who hold broad heaven,\nthen to Artemis, great Zeus’ daughter, I find you most\nnearly akin in beauty and height and carriage; but if\nyou’re mortal, one of those who dwell here on earth, then thrice\nblessed indeed are your father and the lady your mother,\nthrice blessed your brothers! Greatly warmed with pleasure\nmust their hearts always be on your account, as they see\nso fine an offshoot taking her place among the dancers!\nBut blessed at heart, far above all others, is he\nwho’ll dower you with bride-gifts and lead you to his home!\nNever before have my eyes seen a mortal such as you are,\neither man or woman: I’m awed at the sight of you!\nOn Delos once, beside Apollo’s altar, I saw\nsomething like you: a young palm-shoot springing up—\nI put in there, along with a crowd of followers,\non the same journey fated to bring me such misfortune—\nand likewise at that sight I was long in awe,\nsince never before had such a tree sprung from earth!\nJust so, lady, I’m awed and amazed by you, and greatly\nfear now to touch your knees. Much hardship has assailed me:\nfor twenty days—until yesterday, when I got clear\nof the wine-dark sea—the waves and storm winds bore me\naway from the isle of Ogygia. Now some god’s landed me here,\nI guess, to suffer more trouble, for I don’t suppose\nit’ll stop now: the gods have plenty in store for me still.\nSo, lady, show me compassion: after all my suffering\nyou’re the first person I’ve met—not a single other one\ndo I know of all those who possess this city and this country.\nJust show me the way into town, give me some rag to wear—\nmaybe you had a wrapper for the clothes you brought here?—\nand may the gods grant you all that your heart desires,\nhusband, home, and like-mindedness—a precious gift,\nfor there’s nothing greater or better, ever, than when two\nlike-minded people are keeping house together,\na man and his wife: much frustration for their ill-wishers,\nmuch joy for their friends, but they two know it the best.”\nThen white-armed Nausikaa made him this answer: “Stranger,\nyou seem neither malicious nor witless: but it’s Zeus,\nthe Olympian in person, who bestows good fortune on men,\nthe good and the bad, to each as he wills; I suppose\nhe chose this lot for you, and you just have to bear it.\nBut now, since it’s our land and city that you’ve come to,\nyou’ll not go short of clothing nor of anything else\nthat befits a long-suffering suppliant on arrival.\nI’ll show you the way into town, name the inhabitants:\nit’s the Phaiakians who possess this land and city,\nand I am the daughter of great-hearted Alkinoos,\nin whom the Phaiakians’ power and might are vested.”\nThat said, she snapped out orders to her fair-tressed handmaids:\n“Come back here, girls! Scuttling off when you see a man?\nDo you really suppose he’s some kind of enemy?\nThere’s no mortal alive, nor could there ever be one,\nwho’d show up in this land of Phaiakian men\nwith hostile intent, so dear are we to the immortals!\nRemote is our dwelling, far off in the surging deep;\nnone further distant, other mortals don’t mix with us.\nNo, this is some ill-starred drifter who’s ended up here,\nand we must now take care of, since from Zeus are all\nstrangers and beggars: any gift, though small, is welcome.\nSo come, girls, provide this stranger with food and drink,\nand wash him off in the river, well sheltered from the wind.”\nSo she spoke. They stopped, and encouraged one another,\nand brought Odysseus to shelter, just as Nausikaa,\ndaughter of great-hearted Alkinoos, had told them to do,\nand put beside him a mantle and tunic to wear, and gave him\nthe golden flask containing soft liquid olive oil,\nand offered to wash him off in the flow of the river.\nThen godlike Odysseus addressed the handmaids, saying:\n“Handmaids, stand further off, leave me on my own\nto scrub off the brine from my shoulders, rub myself over\nwith oil—indeed it’s a long time since oil came near my skin.\nI’m not going to bathe in your presence: I feel embarrassed\nto be naked among all you fair-tressed young ladies.”\nSo he spoke. They went back, told Nausikaa what he’d said.\nNow godlike Odysseus scrubbed off with river water\nthe brine encrusting his back and his broad shoulders,\nand wiped the unharvested sea’s scurf from his head;\nthen when he’d washed all over, and rubbed himself with oil,\nand had put on the clothes that the unwed girl provided,\nthen Athene, offspring of Zeus, made him in appearance\ntaller and stronger, made the hair spring from his head\nin rich curls, like the flower of the hyacinth. As when a man\noverlays silver with gold, a skillful artisan who’s been\ntaught every craft by Hephaistos and Pallas Athene,\nand thus turns out the most elegant handiwork,\nsuch was the grace she shed upon his head and shoulders.\nThen he took himself off, sat down on the seashore\nagleam with beauty and grace: the girl stared, awestruck,\nand addressed her fair-tressed handmaids, saying: “Listen,\nmy white-armed handmaids: let me tell you something!\nNot without the gods’ will—all the gods who hold Olympos—\nhas this man come here to mingle with the godlike Phaiakians!\nBefore, he seemed to me to be mean and shabby,\nwhereas now he resembles the gods who possess broad heaven!\nIf only a man such as this could be chosen as my husband—\ncould be domiciled here—might even want to stay here!\nBut come, girls, provide the stranger with food and drink.”\nSo she spoke, and they readily heard and obeyed her,\nand set before Odysseus both food and drink. So now\nthe much-enduring godlike Odysseus both ate and drank,\nravenously, since he’d gone a long time without food.\nNow white-armed Nausikaa had one more thought. She folded\nthe clothes, and stowed them in the beautiful wagon,\nand yoked the hard-hoofed mules, and climbed aboard herself.\nThen she called out to Odysseus, addressed him directly:\n“Get up now, stranger, and I’ll guide you to town, direct you\nto my wise father’s house, where, I promise you, you’ll make\nthe acquaintance of all the best of the Phaiakians.\nBut be sure to do as I say—and you don’t strike me as witless.\nAs long as we’re out in the countryside, fields and farmland,\ncome briskly along with my girls behind the mules\nand wagon; I’ll lead the way. But when we’re about\nto enter the city—there’s a high wall round it, a fine\nharbor on either side of the city, with a narrow entrance,\nand trim vessels are moored all along the way, each one\nwith a slip of its own, private docking for everyone;\nthere too is the place of assembly, by Poseidon’s fine precinct,\nmarked out with great deep-bedded quarried stones,\nand it’s there that they busy themselves with the black ships’ tackle,\ntheir cables and sails, and there that they trim their oar blades;\nfor bows and quivers are not the Phaiakians’ concern,\nbut ships’ masts, oars, and the trim vessels themselves,\nin which with delight they traverse the sea’s grey waters.\nIt’s their rude comments I want to avoid, the chance that later\nsome man may blame me—there are unkind folk among us—\nand one of the nastier sort might say if he met us:\n‘Who’s this tall handsome stranger tagging after Nausikaa?\nWhere did she pick him up? Her husband-to-be, no doubt!\nSome stray off a ship she’ll be bringing in, I suppose,\nfrom a foreign crew—there aren’t any from hereabouts—\nunless some god’s come down from heaven in answer\nto her endless prayers, and she’ll keep him around for life!\nBetter, if she herself went off and found a husband\nelsewhere, since she despises these men here in the district,\nthough many top-class Phaiakians are courting her.’ So they’ll say,\nand such remarks would attach a scandal to my name.\nI too would disapprove if another girl behaved thus—\none that in defiance of her dear father and mother\nconsorted with men before reaching the day of public marriage.\nSo, stranger, quickly grasp what I’m telling you, to ensure\nprompt assistance from my father in getting you back home.\nYou’ll find a fine grove of Athene near the road, a grove\nof poplars; a spring gushes up in it, there’s a meadow round it.\nThat’s where my father’s estate is, his flourishing orchard—\nas far from town as the shout of a man will carry.\nSit down there and wait a while, long enough for us\nto get to the city, arrive at my father’s house. But when\nyou reckon we’ve made it home, then yourself go on\nto the city of the Phaiakians, and ask around\nwhere you can find the house of great-hearted Alkinoos.\nIt’s easily recognized—even a child could guide you,\nthe merest infant, since the other Phaiakians’ houses\naren’t built on a scale to match the abode of heroic\nAlkinoos! Then, when you reach that the house and courtyard,\ngo quickly through the main hall, until you come upon\nmy mother—you’ll find her sitting in firelight by the hearth,\nspinning sea-purple yarn on a distaff, a wonderful sight,\nleaning against a pillar, her maids seated behind her;\nand there is my father’s throne, set close by her side,\nwhere he sits and drinks his wine like an immortal.\nGo on past him, throw your arms round the knees\nof my mother, if you’re to get a quick and happy glimpse\nof your day of homecoming, no matter how far you’ve come:\nit’s if she looks on you with favor in her heart\nthat there’s hope for you of seeing your people, of getting\nback to your own strong house and your native country.”\nSo saying, she lashed out with her shining whip at the mules,\nand they quickly took off, away from the flowing river:\nthey trotted well, well did they ply their feet, and she drove\ntaking good care that Odysseus and her handmaids\ncould keep up on foot, used her whip very sparingly.\nAs the sun set they reached the famous grove, sacred\nto Athene. Here godlike Odysseus sat himself down,\nand at once made his prayer to great Zeus’ daughter: “Hear me,\nunwearying child of Zeus of the aegis! Listen now,\nas you failed to listen before when I was stricken,\nwhen the far-famed Earth-Shaker struck me! Grant that now\nwhen I come among the Phaiakians I’m befriended and pitied.”\nSo he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him,\nbut did not yet show herself to him, for she respected\nher father’s brother, who continued to rage against\ngodlike Odysseus until he got back to his own country.\n",

         "\nSo while Odysseus prayed there, godlike and much-enduring,\nthe strength of her two mules bore the girl back to town.\nWhen she arrived at her father’s renowned abode\nshe pulled up in the forecourt. Her brothers, men like immortals,\ncame out, crowded round her, unyoked the mules\nfrom the wagon, carried the laundry indoors, while she\nherself went to her room. There a fire was lit for her by\nan old crone from Apeire, her chambermaid, Eurymedousa.\nLong ago the trim ships had brought her back from Apeire,\nand they’d chosen her as a prize for Alkinoos, since he ruled\nover all the Phaiakians: the people obeyed him like a god.\nShe’d reared white-armed Nausikaa in his halls; now it was she\nwho lit her a fire and made ready her supper in her room.\nThen Odysseus got up to go to the city, and Athene,\nwishing him well, shed a thick mist round about him,\nso that no great-hearted Phaiakian whom he encountered\nshould address him in uncivil terms, ask who he might be;\nthen, when he was about to enter the pleasant city,\nthe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, met him, in the guise\nof a young virginal girl with a pitcher. She stopped before him,\nand godlike Odysseus questioned her, saying: “My child,\ncould you not guide me to the house of a man by name\nAlkinoos, who’s the ruler among the people here?\nI’m a long-suffering stranger, come from a remote\nand far-off country, so I possess no knowledge\nof the people who occupy this city and its land.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying:\n“Yes, stranger, father, I can show you the house you want,\nfor this man’s the neighbor of my own illustrious father!\nJust keep silent and follow where I lead the way—\nDon’t catch anyone’s eye, or ask them questions,\nfor the folk hereabouts have little patience with strangers,\nand are short on welcome for those from another country.\nThey rely on the swiftness of the racing vessels in which\nthey traverse the sea’s great gulf, a gift from the Earth-Shaker:\ntheir ships contrive all the speed of a wing or a thought.”\nHaving said this, Pallas Athene then led the way\nbriskly, and he followed in the goddess’ footsteps.\nNor did the Phaiakians, famed for their ships, observe him\ngoing through the city among them; fair-tressed Athene,\ndread goddess, did not allow it: she shed a marvelous\nmist over him, out of the kindness she bore him in her heart.\nOdysseus gazed in wonder at the trim ships and the harbors,\nthe heroes’ assembly places, the city walls long and high\nand fitted with palisades, a marvelous sight to behold.\nWhen they arrived at the king’s magnificent dwelling\nthe first to speak was the goddess, grey-eyed Athene:\n“Here is the house, stranger, father, that you asked me to show you!\nYou’ll find Zeus’ nurslings, the princes, right inside there\neating their dinner. Go in, and don’t let your heart\nshow alarm: a man whose every move speaks boldness\ndoes better, even supposing he comes from some other country.\nThe first person you’ll met in the great hall is its mistress:\nArete’s the name by which she’s known, and she comes\nof the very same stock that bred Alkinoos, the king.\nNausithoos first Poseidon, the Earth-Shaker,\nsired on Periboia, a woman of matchless beauty,\nthe youngest daughter of great-hearted Eurymedon,\nwho once ruled as king over the arrogant Giants,\nbut destroyed his reckless people and was destroyed himself.\nWith her Poseidon lay in love and begot a son,\ngreat-hearted Nausithoos, who ruled the Phaiakians,\nand Nausithoos sired Alkinoos and Rhexenor.\nApollo, the silver-bowed, struck Rhexenor down\nwhile a sonless bridegroom, who left one daughter only,\nArete: her Alkinoos took as his wife, and honored\nas no other woman upon this earth is honored\nof all those who run their households subject to men,\nso honored at heart is she, and ever has been,\nby her dear children and by Alkinoos himself,\nand by the people, who look upon her as a goddess\nand so greet her when she goes abroad through the city;\nfor she herself is in no way lacking in judgment\nand settles disputes with goodwill, even those between men.\nSo if she’s well disposed toward you, then there’s a chance\nthat you’ll get to see your own people, make it back home\nto your high-roofed house and your own native land.”\nSo saying, grey-eyed Athene now departed, over\nthe unharvested sea, took off from delightful Scheria\nand came to Marathon and wide-streeted Athens,\nand entered the close-set house of Erechtheus. But Odysseus\nwent to Alkinoos’ splendid abode. Much his heart pondered\nas he stood there, even before he reached its brazen threshold,\nfor there was a radiance as of the sun or the moon\nover the high-roofed home of great-hearted Alkinoos.\nBronze walls stretched this way and that to the inmost\nroom from the threshold, framed by a cobalt frieze;\ngolden doors safeguarded the close-built inner domain,\nwith silver doorposts set in a threshold of bronze,\nand silver the lintel above, and of gold the door-latch.\nOn either side of each door stood gold and silver dogs\ncreated with consummate skill by Hephaistos and set there\nto keep watch over the house of great-hearted Alkinoos:\nimmortal creatures and ageless all their days.\nInside, chairs were set on both sides along the wall\nfrom the threshold through to the inmost chamber, and on them\nwere laid soft, fine-woven covers, the work of women,\nand here it was that the Phaiakian leaders would sit,\ndrinking and eating: unfailing abundance was theirs.\nYouths made of gold there were too, standing on solid\npedestals, who held blazing torches in their hands\nto light up the night for those at dinner in the great hall.\nAnd there were fifty house slaves there in the hall, women,\nof whom some were grinding yellow grain in a mill\nand others weaving on looms or twirling the distaff\nas they sat there like a tall aspen’s flickering leaves;\nand from the close-woven fabrics dripped the soft oil.\nFor just as Phaiakian men were skilled above all others\nat steering a swift ship over the deep, so too their women\nwere expert weavers: Athene had given them unsurpassed\nunderstanding of exquisite handiwork, and clever minds.\nOutside the courtyard, close to the doors, was a large\nfour-acre orchard, with a hedge in place all round it:\nthere fruit trees flourished, luxuriant and tall,\npears, pomegranates, ripe-fruited apple trees,\nsweet fig trees and abundantly fertile olives.\nThe produce of these never failed or perished, either\nin winter or summer, but lasted throughout the year:\nsome fruits the west wind’s breeze grew, others it ripened;\npear mellowed upon pear here, apple on apple,\ngrape cluster upon cluster, fig upon fig. There too\nwas rooted a vineyard, richly productive, of which\none part was a warm sun-trap on level ground for drying,\nwhile clusters elsewhere were being culled at vintage\nor trodden; and grapes still unripe, out in front, were either\nshedding their blossom or darkening to purple. There too,\nby the last row of vines, grew well-planned vegetable beds\nof every variety, bright green the whole year through;\nand there were two springs, one discharging its water over\nthe whole garden, the other rising by the courtyard threshold\ntoward the high house. From this the townsfolk drew their water.\nSuch were the gods’ fine gifts in Alkinoos’ domain.\nMuch-enduring godlike Odysseus stood there and gazed;\nBut when in his heart he’d marveled at everything, then\nhe quickly stepped over the threshold and into the building,\nwhere he found the Phaiakians’ leaders and counselors pouring\nlibations from their cups to Argos’ far-sighted slayer,\nto whom they would pour the last drink when thinking of bedtime.\nMuch-enduring godlike Odysseus went through the hall, concealed\nby the thick mist that Athene had earlier shed around him\ntill he came to where Arete was, and the king Alkinoos.\nAbout the knees of Arete, Odysseus now threw his arms,\nand then at once the divine mist lifted from him,\nand all in the hall fell silent at the sight of the man, and they\nstared at him in amazement as Odysseus made his appeal:\n“Arete, godlike Rhexenor’s daughter, after much hardship\nI come as a suppliant to your husband and your knees—\nand to those dining here—may the gods grant them plenty\nin this life, and may each of them bequeath to his children\nthe wealth in his halls, and all honors his people gave him!\nI beg you, give me an escort to get to my own country,\nand soon: I’ve long suffered much, far from my dear ones.”\nSo saying, down he sat at the hearth, among the ashes\nclose by the fire. They all were hushed and silent. At last\nthere spoke among them the elderly hero Echeneos,\na man who’d seen more years than any Phaiakian,\nwell skilled at speaking, well versed in ancient wisdom:\nhe with good intent now addressed the assembly, saying:\n“Alkinoos, this is not the best way, nor is it seemly, to let\na stranger sit on the ground, at the hearth among the ashes—\nbut people are holding back, awaiting your word! Come then,\nraise the stranger up, and give him a silver-studded\nchair to sit on, tell the heralds to mix more wine\nthat we may pour libations to Zeus, hurler of bolts,\nthe protector of sacrosanct suppliants! And also let\nthe housekeeper give this stranger dinner from her store.”\nWhen Alkinoos, princely in power, heard these words, he took\nthe wise, subtle-minded Odysseus by the hand, and raised him\nup from the hearth, and seated him on a shining chair—\nmaking his son get up, the kindly Laodamas,\nwho sat next to him, and was the one whom he loved best.\nA maid brought hand-washing water in a fine golden\npitcher, and poured it into a silver basin, so he\ncould wash, and drew up a polished table beside him.\nThe respected housekeeper brought and set out bread,\nwith many side dishes, giving freely of her supplies.\nMuch-enduring and godlike Odysseus drank and ate.\nThen Alkinoos, princely in power, said to the herald:\n“Pontonoos, mix a bowlful, serve wine to all in the hall,\nthat we may pour libations to Zeus, hurler of bolts,\nthe protector of sacrosanct suppliants!”\nSo he spoke,\nand Pontonoos came and mixed the mind-honeying wine\nand served it to all, with first drops for libation. But when\nthey’d made libation and drunk as much as the heart desired,\nAlkinoos then addressed them, speaking as follows:\n“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\nwhile I tell you what the heart in my breast dictates.\nNow that you’ve dined, go home and get your rest:\ntomorrow, early, we’ll summon more of the elders,\nwelcome this stranger here in our halls, and offer\nchoice sacrifice to the gods. Then we’ll further consider\nthe matter of his conveyance, how without toil or trouble,\ncarried by us, he’s to reach his native country—\nhowever far distant that may be—soon and rejoicing;\nnor on the way shall he suffer any harm or setback\nuntil he sets foot on his own land—although thereafter\nhe’ll suffer whatever his fate and the weighty Spinners have spun\nwith his birth-thread right from the moment his mother bore him!\nBut if he’s some kind of immortal, come down from heaven,\nthen this is a new gambit of the gods’ contriving, since\nalways till now they’ve appeared to us plainly manifest\nwhenever we offer them our most lavish sacrifices,\nand they feast among us, sitting where we sit ourselves.\nWhat’s more, if a solitary traveler should meet them on the road\nthey don’t use disguise, since we’re close kin to them,\nlike the Kyklopes or the wild tribes of the Giants.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Alkinoos, don’t let that bother you: I am not in any way\nlike the immortals who hold the broad heavens, either\nphysically or in nature: I look, and am, mortal, a man!\nWhoever you know of mankind that shoulder the heaviest load\nof grief, to them I might liken myself in my sorrows—\nand indeed I could tell a yet longer tale of all\nthe troubles I’ve endured by the will of the gods!\nBut first let me eat some dinner, grieving though I am:\nfor nothing exists more shameless than one’s loathsome belly,\nthat forces a man to take notice of it at need, however\ndistressed he may be and stricken by grief at heart,\nas I am grief-stricken at heart now; yet still unremittingly\nit commands me to eat and drink, forces me to forget\neverything I have suffered, insists on being refilled!\nBut will you please make haste, at daybreak’s first appearance,\nto set me, the ill-starred one, on the road to my own country\nafter all my troubles: let life leave me, once I’ve seen\nmy possessions, my servants, and my great high-roofed house.”\nSo he spoke: they all applauded and approved the dispatch\nof the stranger, since his request had been properly presented.\nWhen they’d made libation and drunk as much as the heart desired,\nthey went, each man to his home, to get their repose;\nand godlike Odysseus was left there in the hall\nwith Arete and godlike Alkinoos sitting beside him,\nwhile the maidservants cleared away the remains of dinner.\nThen white-armed Arete was the first to speak, for she\nhad recognized his mantle and tunic at first sight\nas fine clothes she herself and her serving women had made;\nso now she spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Stranger, this question I’ll ask first myself: Who are you,\nand from where? Who gave you these clothes? Did you not\nsay that you arrived here while wandering over the deep?”\nThen, responding to her, resourceful Odysseus declared:\n“It’s hard, my queen, to render an exhaustive account\nof my troubles: the heavenly gods have given me so many!\nBut this I will tell you, in response to your enquiry:\nThere’s an island, Ogygia, that lies far off in the deep,\nand the daughter of Atlas, crafty Kalypso, lives there,\na dread fair-tressed goddess; with her there’s no one else\nhas intercourse, be it of gods or of mortal humans,\nbut unfortunate that I am, some god brought me alone\nto her hearth, after Zeus struck my swift ship with a bright\nbolt, and destroyed it in the midst of the wine-dark deep.\nThere all the rest of my staunch companions perished,\nbut I clutched in my arms the keel of my curved vessel\nand was borne off for nine days: on the tenth dark night\nthe gods landed me on Ogygia, where Kalypso dwells—\nthat dread fair-tressed goddess! She welcomed me, took me in,\ngave me food, treated me kindly, said she would make me\nimmortal and ageless all my days; but she never\ncould persuade the heart in my breast. There I remained\nfor seven unbroken years, keeping ever damp with my tears\nthe immortal garments in which Kalypso clothed me.\nBut when in its cycle the eighth year arrived for me, then\nshe urged and told me to be on my way once more—\neither she’d had a message from Zeus or else her own mind\nhad changed—and sent me off on a well-bound raft, and gave me\nplenty of bread and sweet wine, with immortal clothes to wear,\nand raised a good tailwind for me, both mild and breezy.\nFor seventeen days then I sailed on over the deep,\nand on the eighteenth your country’s shadowy mountains\ncame into sight, and the heart within me rejoiced.\nBut I was out of luck: I still had plenty of trouble\nto live with, directed against me by Poseidon the Earth-Shaker,\nfor he raised up winds to confront me, delayed my journey\nby horribly roiling the sea, with waves that would not\nlet me sail on, even miserably, aboard my raft: the storm\nbroke it up! Nevertheless, I still somehow managed\nto swim my way through this great gulf of the sea, until\nwind and wave carried me to your coast. Had I attempted\nto land there, the waves would have hurled me upon the strand,\ndashed me against great rocks at this cheerless site;\nBut I kept well clear, and swam on, until I reached the river,\nand this seemed to me the best possible landing place,\nbeing smooth of rocks and offering shelter against the wind.\nOut then I stumbled, half dead, and ambrosial night\ncame on. I got clear of the heaven-fed river, lay down\nto sleep in the bushes, heaped up piles of leaves\naround me: some god shed over me limitless sleep.\nSo there in the leaves, much troubled at heart, I slumbered\nthe whole night through, and next morning until midday\nand later—the sun was declining when at last sweet sleep\nreleased me. Then I saw your daughter’s maids at play\non the shore, and herself among them, like a goddess.\nTo her I appealed: she knew what was proper behavior—\na virtue you’d not expect to find a young casually met\nperson displaying: the young are always so thoughtless!\nShe offered me food in abundance and sparkling wine\nand had me washed in the river and gave me these clothes.\nDistressed I may be, but everything I’ve told you is the truth.”\nThen Alkinoos made him this answer, saying: “Stranger,\nmy child did not behave correctly in one respect: she should\nhave brought you here to our home, along with her handmaids,\nsince she was the first to whom you made your supplication.”\nThen in answer to him resourceful Odysseus declared:\n“Hero, do not for this rebuke your blameless daughter!\nShe did indeed tell me to follow her with her handmaids,\nBut I would not, being scared and embarrassed, in case\nyou might be somehow offended by the sight; we’re all\nvery suspicious-minded, we breeds of men here on earth.”\nAlkinoos again responded to him, saying: “Stranger,\nthe heart in my breast is not the kind to become irate\nwithout good cause: due measure is always better.\nNo, I could wish—Zeus, Father, Athene, Apollo!—that you,\nbeing the kind of man you are, with a mind like my own,\nmight have my daughter, be known as my son-in-law,\nand be domiciled here: a house and property I’d give you\nwere you willing to stay! But against your will shall no\nPhaiakian detain you—never be that Zeus the Father’s wish!\nFor your convoy I set a day, that you may know it surely:\ntomorrow. Then you’ll lie down, overmastered by sleep,\nand they’ll row you over a calm sea until you arrive\nat your country and home—or whatever place you fancy,\neven if it’s somewhere far more distant than Euboia,\nthe most remote of lands—or so say those of our people\nwho saw it when they conveyed the fair-haired Rhadamanthys\nto go visit Tityos, son of Gaia. Thither they voyaged,\nwithout effort completed their journey, and came back\nhome that same day! So shall you too discover\nby how much my vessels are the best, and my young men\nat sweeping the salt sea with their oar blades.”\nSo he spoke.\nMuch-enduring godlike Odysseus, rejoicing, uttered\na personal prayer, in these words: “Zeus, Father, grant\nthat he, Alkinoos, may accomplish all he’s promised!\nSo shall his fame spread, unquenchable, over all\nthe grain-giving earth, and I get home to my own country!”\nSuch the words they exchanged in discussion with one another.\nWhite-armed Arete now instructed her handmaids\nto set up a bedstead down in the colonnade, and on it\nto spread fine purple blankets, with coverlets over them,\nand on top of these fleecy mantles to wear as wraps. The maids\nwent out of the hall with torches held in their hands,\nand after they’d finished draping the close-strung bedstead,\nthey came back to Odysseus, and addressed him, saying:\n“Stranger, up with you now, your bed is made and ready.”\nThus they spoke, and welcome he found it to lie down and rest.\nThere, then, he slept, much-enduring godlike Odysseus,\non the corded bedstead down in the echoing colonnade.\nBut Alkinoos took his repose in the high house’s inmost room,\nand beside him his lady wife now shared their bed and marriage.\n",

         "\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nAlkinoos, princely in power, arose from his slumber,\nand Odysseus, the Zeus-born sacker of cities, rose too.\nAlkinoos, princely in power, now led the way to\nthe Phaiakians’ assembly place, built for them near their ships:\nOn arrival there they sat down on the polished stones\nside by side, while Pallas Athene went through the city\nin the likeness of the herald of sagacious Alkinoos,\nworking on the return of great-hearted Odysseus. To each\nman she met she would say, as she stood beside him:\n“Come now, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\nattend the assembly, and hear all about the stranger\nwho’s recently come to the house of sagacious Alkinoos\nfrom being lost on the deep—in form he’s like the immortals!”\nSo saying she stirred up each man’s heart and spirit,\nand quickly the seats of assembly were all filled up\nby gathering men, many of whom now marveled\nat the sight of Laertes’ sagacious son, for Athene had shed\na wondrous grace over his head and shoulders, made him\nappear both taller and sturdier, so that he might\nbe welcome to all the Phaiakians, and inspire\nawe and respect, and accomplish the numerous feats\nin which the Phaiakians were to make trial of Odysseus.\nWhen they were all in place and gathered together,\nAlkinoos made a speech, addressed the assembly, saying:\n“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\nwhile I tell you what the heart in my breast dictates. This stranger—\nwho he is I don’t know—has wandered here to my house,\nwhether from men of the east or the west. He wants\nconveyance, and is begging us for assurance on that.\nSo let us, as in the past, provide him swift conveyance:\nfor no other man who’s appeared at my house has had to wait\nin misery overlong for the convoy that he needed!\nSo come, let’s haul a black ship down to the bright sea\nfor its maiden voyage; let those fifty-two young men,\nthe best crew in the district, be chosen to serve aboard it;\nand then, when each man has fastened his oar to its rowlock,\ndisembark, come up to my house, partake of a quick meal—\non me, I’ll make ample provision for everybody involved!\nThat’s my order to the young men. As for you others,\nyou sceptered princes, come on up to my beautiful dwelling,\nso we can entertain the stranger as guest in our halls,\nand let no man refuse me! Also fetch the divine minstrel,\nDemodokos: for to him the god’s granted an unmatched gift\nof song, to please, however his spirit may bid him sing.”\nThat said, he led the way, and the sceptered princes followed,\nwhile a herald went off to fetch the divine minstrel,\nand the chosen youths, two and fifty of them, obeyed\nhis orders, and made their way to the unharvested sea,\nand when they reached the ship and the sea, they hauled\nthe black vessel down to deep water, and in its black hull\nproceeded to step the mast, to set the sails, and secure\nthe oars to the leather straps of the rowlocks, all in due order.\nThis done, they spread the white sail, then anchored the vessel\nwell out in deep water. This done, they took themselves off\nto the great abode of sagacious Alkinoos. There they found\nall the courtyards and colonnades and chambers crowded\nwith the many guests that had gathered, both young and old.\nFor them Alkinoos slaughtered a dozen sheep and eight\nwhite-tusked boars and a couple of shambling oxen: these\nthey skinned and dressed, and made ready a delectable feast.\nNow the herald returned, bringing the trusty minstrel,\nwhom the Muse loved dearly, but gave him both good and ill:\nshe robbed him of eyesight, yet made him a sweet singer.\nThe herald Pontonoos set him a silver-studded chair\namid the feasters, leaned it against a tall pillar,\nhung the clear-toned lyre from a peg up over his head,\nand instructed him how to find it with his hands: so far\nthe herald. Beside him he placed a basket and fine table,\nalong with a cup of wine to drink from when so minded.\nNow they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them;\nbut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink\nthe Muse stirred the minstrel to sing of the famous deeds of men\nfrom that lay the fame of which had reached the wide heavens—\nthe quarrel between Odysseus and Peleus’ son, Achilles,\nhow once they contended at a sumptuous feast of the gods\nwith vehement words, and the king of men, Agamemnon,\nwas glad at heart that the best Achaians were in contention,\nfor thus Phoibos Apollo had told him, when giving a response\nin sacred Pytho, after he’d crossed the threshold of stone\nto enquire of the oracle: then it was that the start of trouble\ncame rolling on Trojans and Danaans on account of great Zeus’ plans.\nThis theme the famous minstrel chose. But Odysseus\ntook his great purple mantle in his powerful hands\nand pulled it down over his head, to hide his handsome face,\nashamed to be shedding tears before the Phaiakians.\nEvery time the divine minstrel had a pause in his singing\nOdysseus would wipe off the tears, lift the mantle from his head,\ntake a two-handled cup and pour a libation to the gods;\nbut when he began again—the Phaiakian nobles would urge him\nto sing more, for they took great pleasure in his lays—\nthen Odysseus would once more cover his head and sigh.\nHis weeping escaped the notice of all the others; only\nAlkinoos was aware of it and took notice, since he sat\nbeside him, and could hear his heavy sighing. At once\nhe addressed himself to the Phaiakians, oar-lovers all:\n“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians:\nby now we’ve slaked our desire for the shared banquet\nand the lyre that’s the accompaniment to ample feasting;\nnow let’s go out and make trial in every kind of athletic\ncontest, so that this stranger may tell his friends,\nwhen he gets back home, how far we outstrip other men\nin boxing and wrestling, in jumping and running.”\nThat said,\nhe led the way, and they followed him. On its peg\nthe herald hung up the clear-toned lyre, and took\nDemodokos by the hand, led him out of the hall\nand followed the same road just taken by the other\nPhaiakian nobles to watch the contests. They went\nto the place of assembly: a large throng accompanied them,\ncountless in number; there stood up many fine young men.\nUp got Akroneos, Okyalos and Elatreus,\nNauteus and Prymneus, Anchialos and Eretmeus,\nPonteus and Proreus, Thoon and Anabesineos,\nwith Amphialos, the son of Polyneos, Tekton’s son;\nup, too, Euryalos, peer of man-killing Ares,\nNaubolos’ son, the best in looks and stature—\nbar only peerless Laodamas—of all the Phaiakians;\nand up got the three sons of matchless Alkinoos:\nLaodamas, Halios, and godlike Klytoneos.\nThese then first made trial of themselves in the footrace:\nthe pace was hot from the start, they all raced together,\nspeedily kicking up the dust from the plain; but of them\npeerless Klytoneos proved by far the swiftest runner,\nand by the length of the furrow mules plow in fallow land\nhe got back first to the crowd, well ahead of all the rest.\nThen they competed in the painful art of wrestling,\nand here Euryalos outdid all the best competitors;\nat jumping Amphialos had no rivals in the field,\nwhile with the discus Elatreus was an easy winner,\nand at boxing Laodamas, Alkinoos’ splendid son.\nBut after they’d all enjoyed these athletic contests,\nLaodamas, Alkinoos’ son, had this to say to them:\n“Come, friends, let us ask the stranger if there’s any contest\nthat he knows and has practiced. In build he’s not a weakling—\nlook at his thighs and calves, both arms above them,\nhis sturdy neck: great strength there! He’s not lacking\nin manly vigor, but just broken by many misfortunes:\nfor to my mind there’s nothing worse than the sea\nto break down a man, even though he be the strongest.”\nThen Euryalos in turn responded to him, saying:\n“Laodamas, what you propose is rightly spoken!\nGo challenge him now yourself, tell him what you told us.”\nWhen Alkinoos’ good son heard this, he went and stood\nin the midst, and addressed Odysseus as follows, saying:\n“Come on, stranger, father: you too should try these contests\nif haply you’re skilled in any: and it’s likely that you are\nso skilled, for a man’s life can show no greater glory\nthan what he achieves with his own hands and feet.\nSo come, make trial of yourself, scatter care from your heart!\nYour journey won’t long be delayed now, already your ship\nis hauled down and launched, your companions all are ready.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Laodamas, why do you make me this mocking challenge?\nMy mind is far fuller of sorrows than of contests:\nBefore now I have suffered much, endured much hardship;\nnow here in your assembly I sit, and seek my homecoming,\nmaking my plea to your king and to his people as a whole.”\nEuryalos then replied, taunting him to his face:\n“No, indeed, stranger, you don’t look to me like a man\nfamiliar with contests, such as mankind has in plenty;\nyou’re more the sort that goes to and fro with his many-\noared vessel, a captain of sailors who also are traders,\ntaking care of his freight, an overseer of cargo\nand gain got by greed. You don’t look to me like an athlete.”\nWith an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded:\n“Sir, that was not well said; you sound like some reckless\nbadmouth! It’s true that the gods don’t hand out gracious\ngifts to all men, of either looks, or wit, or eloquence: one man\nwill make a less impressive appearance, and yet\nthe god crowns his speech with grace, people regard him\nwith admiring pleasure, his utterances are sure,\nrespectful and honey-sweet: he stands out in a crowd,\nand as he goes through the city, men look on him as a god.\nAnother may be as handsome as the immortals, but\nno crown of grace will be set on his public speaking—\nand so with you: your looks are outstanding, not even\na god could improve them, but in mind you’re inadequate.\nYou’ve provoked the heart in my breast by your mannerless\nmode of address: I’m no novice at sporting contests\nas you assert—no, I reckon I ranked among the first\nwhile I could safely trust in my vigor and my hands;\nbut now trouble and grief possess me: much I’ve endured,\ncutting my path through men’s wars and the damaging waves.\nYet despite my great suffering I’ll make trial of your contests,\nfor your words gnaw at my heart, what you said drives me on.”\nSo saying, he sprang up, still in his mantle, and seized\na stone quoit—one bigger, thicker, and weightier by far\nthan those the Phaiakians used to compete against each other.\nThis he whirled about and let fly from his mighty hand,\nand the stone whirred: down they crouched on the ground,\ndid the long-oared Phaiakians, men famous for their ships,\nbeneath the stone’s flight. Past the marks of all it flew,\nfast sped from his hand, and Athene—in the likeness of a man—\nchecked the length of the cast, and then addressed him, saying:\n“Even a blind man, stranger, could distinguish this cast of yours\nby feeling for it: it’s not mixed up with the rest but well\nahead of them all. This contest at least should encourage you—\nNo Phaiakian will equal your cast, much less get past it.”\nSo she spoke. Much-enduring godlike Odysseus rejoiced,\nglad to have met with a friendly supporter at these contests.\nThen, in a lighter mood, he spoke among the Phaiakians:\n“Match that cast now, young men! I’ll soon let fly another,\nits equal in length, or maybe an even longer shot!\nAs for the rest of you, if anyone’s heart and spirit\nso bids him, come on, let him try me, since you’ve got me angry—\nboxing, wrestling, or running, I don’t care which,\nany Phaiakian, except for Laodamas in person,\nhe being my host: who’d fight the one that befriended him?\nWitless the man and worthless that would ever challenge\nto a contest the host who gave him a kindly welcome\nin some foreign country: he’d cut all his own hopes short!\nBut of the rest there’s none I either refuse or slight:\nI want to learn their strength, to test myself against them.\nFor I’m no slouch all round in the contests that men practice—\nwell do I know how to handle a polished bow,\nand always I’d be the first to shoot and hit my man\nin the thick of the enemy, though many of my comrades\nwere standing beside me, loosing off arrows at the foe.\nPhiloktetes alone it was who excelled me at archery\nin the land of the Trojans, when we Achaians were shooting!\nOf the rest I can claim to be the best by far\nof all mortals that now eat bread upon this earth,\nthough I have no wish to compete with those of former times,\nwith Herakles or Oichalian Eurytos, such men\nas competed in marksmanship even with the immortals.\nFor that was why great Eurytos died young, why no old age\ncaught up with him in his halls: Apollo, furious, slew him\nbecause he’d challenged the god to an archery contest. What’s more,\nI can throw a spear further than any man can shoot an arrow!\nIn the footrace alone I fear I may be outrun by some\nPhaiakian: I’ve been harshly battered by countless waves,\nand aboard my ship I had no long-term care for my body,\nwhich is why my limbs are now very badly out of trim.”\nSo he spoke, and they all remained hushed in silence. Only\nAlkinoos made him an answer, addressed him saying:\n“Stranger, your words here among us were not ungracious,\nbut due to your wish to make clear your innate prowess—\nbeing angered, because that man confronted you in this contest\nand mocked you, in a way no mortal who was aware\nof how to speak fittingly would disparage your prowess.\nSo come now, give heed to my words, that you may tell them\nto some other hero, when in your own great hall\nyou’re feasting, together with your wife and children,\nand recall our feats, the achievements that to us too\nZeus has constantly granted since the days of our fathers.\nNow we’re not unmatched as boxers, or as wrestlers, but in\nthe footrace we run swiftly; we’re the best of seamen,\nand dear to us always are feasting, and dancing, and the lyre,\nand changes of clothes, hot baths, and bed. So come,\nall you Phaiakians who are our finest dancers,\nfoot it gaily, so that the stranger may report to his friends,\nafter getting back home, how far we surpass all others\nin seamanship, fleetness of foot, and dancing and singing!\nAnd let someone go at once and fetch for Demodokos\nthe clear-toned lyre that’s lying somewhere in our halls.”\nSo spoke godlike Alkinoos, and the herald got up\nto go fetch the hollow lyre from the king’s domain.\nThen nine umpires arose, all chosen by popular vote,\nwhose job was to regulate every detail of the games.\nThey leveled a dancing floor, cleared a fine open space,\nand the herald approached, bringing the clear-toned lyre\nfor Demodokos, who then went to the middle, and round him\nstood young men in youth’s first bloom, well skilled at dancing,\nand performed the steps of the sacred dance. Odysseus,\nmarveling, watched the flash of their feet as they moved.\nDemodokos now struck his lyre to introduce the fine lay\nabout Ares’ love for sweet-garlanded Aphrodite—\nhow they first lay together in the house of Hephaistos,\nsecretly, how he showered her with gifts, shamed the marital\nbed of the lord Hephaistos, to whom Helios promptly came\nwith the news that he’d seen them making love. And when\nHephaistos heard his heart-rending tattle, he went\noff to his smithy, secretly planning revenge,\nand set on its block the great anvil, and hammered out bonds\nunbreakable and unloosable, made to hold fast when set;\nthen, having fashioned this snare in his fury against Ares,\nhe went to the chamber where his own dear bedstead stood\nand circled the bonds round the bedposts from every angle:\nmany he hung overhead, attached to the rafters, as fine\nas spiders’ webs, so that none could see them, not even\none of the blessed gods, so craftily were they fashioned.\nThen, when he’d placed his snares all around the bed, he made\nas though he was going to Lemnos, that well-built citadel,\nof all lands on earth to him by far the dearest. And no\nblind watch did golden-reined Ares keep, but when\nhe saw the famed craftsman Hephaistos departing, he went\nstraight off to the house of the same famous Hephaistos,\nhis mind imagining sex with sweet-garlanded Kythereia.\nNow she from a spell with her father, the mighty son of Kronos,\nhad just arrived, and sat down: Ares entered the house\nand took her by the hand, and addressed her, saying:\n“Come, my love, let’s to bed and its pleasures: for no longer\nis Hephaistos around here, but I think is on his way\nto Lemnos, off there visiting the rough-spoken Sintians.”\nSuch his words, and she welcomed the prospect of bedding him.\nThey went to bed and lay down. But the crafty bonds devised\nby artful Hephaistos immobilized them: they were unable\nto move their limbs, let alone get up. Then they knew the truth,\nthat for them no longer was there any chance of escape.\nSo the far-famed double cripple came home and found them,\nhaving turned back before he reached the land of Lemnos,\nsince Helios kept watch for him, brought him the news.\nHe went to his house now, deeply troubled at heart,\nand stood there in the forecourt, gripped by a wild fury,\nand with a terrible shout cried out to all the gods:\n“Zeus! Father! All you other blessed immortal gods!\nCome see a sight both ridiculous and unseemly—\nthe way because I’m lame Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite\ndishonors me constantly by loving destructive Ares\nbecause he’s strong-limbed and handsome, whereas I\nwas born misshapen, for which there’s no one to blame\nbut my two parents—would they’d never had me! Now you\nshall see for yourselves the way they go to make love\nin my own bed, to me a grievous sight—yet somehow\nI don’t imagine they’ll want to lie thus a minute longer\nhowever much they’re in love: they’ll soon lose the urge\nfor sleep—rather those crafty bonds will hold them tight\nuntil her father pays back to me every single bride-gift\nI lavished on him in return for his bitch of a daughter,\nsince the daughter’s beautiful, but lacking in self-restraint.”\nSo he spoke, and the gods came crowding to his bronze-floored\nhouse: Poseidon, the Earth-Embracer, along with Hermes,\nthe helper, and Lord Apollo, the deadly archer; but\nthe female deities stayed, every one, at home for shame.\nSo there they stood in the doorway: gods, givers of good things,\nand laughter unquenchable rose among the blessed gods\nas they gazed at the crafty work of ingenious Hephaistos,\nand thus would one of them say, with a glance at his neighbor:\n“Ill deeds don’t thrive! The slow catches the swift,\njust as now Hephaistos the laggard has caught Ares,\nthough of the gods holding Olympos he’s the swiftest;\nthough lame, he caught him by guile. Now Ares must pay\nthe adulterer’s fine.” So they spoke to one another.\nBut to Hermes the lord Apollo, the son of Zeus, now said:\n“Hermes, Zeus’ son, guide, giver of good things, would you\nbe ready, even if hard-pressed by such powerful bonds,\nto sleep in a bed at the side of golden Aphrodite?”\nThen the guide, the slayer of Argos, answered him: “How I wish,\nLord Apollo, deadly archer, that this might come to pass—\nwith three times as many unshakable bonds set round me,\nand you gods, with all the goddesses too, looking on—\nthat I might sleep at the side of golden Aphrodite!”\nAt his words laughter arose among the immortal gods.\nPoseidon, though, was not laughing, but kept entreating\nHephaistos, the far-famed craftsman, to set Ares free:\nhe spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Free him,\nand I promise on his behalf, as you require, that he will\npay the full proper sum before the immortal gods.”\nThen the far-famed double cripple answered him thus:\n“Do not demand this of me, Poseidon, Earth-Embracer:\na pledge made on behalf of the worthless is a worthless pledge!\nAnd how could I constrain you among the immortal gods\nwere Ares to dodge both debt and bond and just vanish?”\nThen Poseidon the Earth-Shaker responded to him, saying:\n“Hephaistos, even were Ares to renege on the debt he owes\nand take off in flight, I myself will pay the total sum.”\nThe far-famed double cripple responded to this, saying:\n“I cannot refuse your offer: that would not be seemly.”\nSo saying, the mighty Hephaistos unlocked the snares,\nand the two, once freed from the snares, despite their strength,\nsprang up at once: he, Ares, now took himself off to Thrace,\nwhile she, smiling Aphrodite, left for Paphos on Cyprus,\nwhere she had her sacred precinct and fragrant altar.\nThere the Graces bathed her, anointed her with ambrosial\noil, such as soothes the skin of the gods who are forever,\nand clothed her in elegant raiment, a wonder to behold.\nThis was the lay the famed minstrel sang; and Odysseus\nlistened with great enjoyment, as did the others,\nthe long-oared Phaiakians, men famous for their ships.\nThen Alkinoos had Halios and Laodamas dance—\nalone, since no one else could match their performance.\nThey took in their hands an exquisite purple ball,\nthat the skilled artist Polybos had fashioned for them,\nand one would toss it high to the shadowy clouds,\nleaning back, while the other would leap high off the ground\nand easily catch it before his feet touched earth again.\nBut when they’d tested their skill at throwing the ball\nstraight up, then they danced upon the grain-giving earth,\nquickly tossing the ball to and fro, while the other youths\nstood beating time, and a din of stamping feet arose.\nThen godlike Odysseus addressed Alkinoos, saying:\n“Alkinoos, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\nyou claimed that these your dancers were unrivaled,\nand they’ve proved it true: I’m awed by the sight of them.”\nSo he spoke, and Alkinoos, princely in power, rejoiced,\nand at once addressed the oar-loving Phaiakians, saying:\n“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians:\nthis stranger seems to me a man of the highest discretion!\nCome then, let’s give him a guest-gift, as is befitting:\ntwelve renowned princes hold sway in this our country\nas rulers, and I myself am the thirteenth: let each\none of the twelve now bring him a fresh-washed mantle\nand tunic, as well as a talent of precious gold,\nand let’s collect all this now, so that the stranger\nmay go happy to supper, holding our gifts in his hands—\nand let Euryalos make amends to him in person,\nwith words and a gift: what he said was most unfitting.”\nSo he spoke: they all approved, and endorsed the offer,\nand each sent off a herald to fetch the gifts,\nand Euryalos in his turn now responded, saying:\n“Alkinoos, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\nI shall indeed makes amends to the stranger, as you bid me.\nI’ll give him this all-bronze sword, which possesses a hilt\nof silver, and a scabbard of fresh-sawn ivory\nencases it. It will be of great value to him.”\nThat said,\nto Odysseus he handed over the silver-studded sword,\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “Greetings, father,\nstranger: if any word that’s been uttered was improper,\nmay storm winds now snatch it up and carry it off! And may\nthe gods grant you see your wife, reach your own country:\nToo long you’ve endured hardship far from your dear ones.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Greetings to you too, friend! May the gods enrich you,\nand may you never hereafter be seized by longing for\nthis sword you’ve given me—with a handsome apology.”\nThat said, he hung from his shoulders the silver-studded sword,\nand the sun went down, and the glorious gifts appeared.\nNoble heralds now bore them to Alkinoos’ abode,\nwhere the sons of peerless Alkinoos took charge of these\nexquisite presents, and set them before their revered\nmother. Alkinoos, princely in power, led them,\nand in they came and sat down on the high-backed chairs.\nThen mighty Alkinoos addressed himself to Arete:\n“My wife, bring a fine chest here, the best we have,\nand in it put a fresh-laundered mantle and a tunic,\nand set a bronze cauldron to warm on the fire, heat water in it,\nso that when the stranger has bathed and had a good look\nat all the gifts the peerless Phaiakians brought here,\nhe may then enjoy the feast, and the minstrel’s singing;\nand I shall make him a present of this fine golden\ncup of mine, that he may remember me all his days\nwhen he pours in his hall libations to Zeus and the other gods.”\nSo he spoke; and Arete gave orders to her handmaids\nto set over the fire a great cauldron as quickly as they could.\nThey settled the bathwater cauldron on the blazing flames\nand filled it with water and under it kindled firewood.\nFlames lapped the cauldron’s belly, the water grew hot,\nwhile Arete fetched for the stranger an exquisite chest\nfrom her storeroom, and in it placed the beautiful gifts—\nthe clothes, the gold—that the Phaiakians provided,\ntogether with a mantle and fine tunic that she put in\nherself, then addressed Odysseus with winged words, saying:\n“Take care of the lid yourself, put a quick knot on it,\nlest someone rob you during your homeward journey,\nwhile you’re traveling, sweetly asleep, aboard that black ship.”\nWhen much-enduring godlike Odysseus heard those words\nhe at once fitted the lid on, and quickly secured it with\na complex knot he’d once learned from the lady Kirke.\nThen promptly the housekeeper called him to go and be scrubbed\nin the bathtub, and he rejoiced in his heart on seeing\nthe warm bath, since such care had been far from frequent\never since he’d left the home of fair-tressed Kalypso,\nthough till then he’d been cared for continually like a god.\nSo when the handmaids had bathed him, rubbed him with oil,\nthey dressed him in a splendid mantle and tunic, and he\nstepped away from the bathtub and went to join the men\nat their wine. And Nausikaa, whose beauty was from the gods,\nstood by the pillar supporting the close-packed roof,\nand marveled at Odysseus as she took in his appearance,\nand spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Farewell, stranger: even when you’re back in your own country\nremember me: I was the first to whom you owed your life.”\nIn answer to her resourceful Odysseus then said:\n“Nausikaa, daughter of great-hearted Alkinoos,\nso now may Zeus, Here’s loud-thundering husband,\nlet me return to see the day of my homecoming!\nThere too I’ll pray to you as I would to a god\nall the days of my life: for you saved my life, my dear.”\nWith that he sat down on the chair beside King Alkinoos.\nBy now they were serving out portions and mixing the wine,\nand the herald came in leading the trusty minstrel\nDemodokos, much honored by the people, set his chair\nin the midst of the diners, backed against a high pillar.\nThen resourceful Odysseus addressed himself to the herald\nas he cut off a piece of the chine—more still was left—\nfrom a white-tusked boar, with rich fat on either side:\n“Here, herald, take this cut and give it to eat\nto Demodokos: I salute him, despite my grief:\nfor among all men worldwide minstrels receive their share\nof honor and reverence, since the Muse has taught them\nthe ways of song, and has love for the whole tribe of singers.”\nSo he spoke: the herald took it and placed it in the hands\nof the hero Demodokos. He accepted it with pleasure.\nNow they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them;\nbut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nthen resourceful Odysseus addressed Demodokos, saying:\n“Demodokos, higher than all mortal men I praise you,\nwhether it was the Muse, Zeus’ daughter, or Apollo\nthat taught you, for you sing truly of the Achaians’ fate—\nall that they did and suffered, every hardship they endured,\nas though you’d been there yourself, or were told by one who had!\nBut change your theme now, and tell us about the Horse,\nthe Wooden Horse that Epeios made with Athene’s help,\nand Odysseus led up to the citadel, a deceptive trap,\nafter filling it with the men who sacked Ilion. If indeed\nyou perform this lay in right fashion, then I’ll declare,\nto all mankind, that the god, with a propitious heart,\nhas bestowed upon you the gift of divine song.”\nSo he spoke.\nSetting out from the god, the other began to narrate the tale,\nfrom when the Argives embarked on their well-benched ships\nand sailed away, after setting fire to the huts,\nwhile those led by far-famed Odysseus were already sitting\nin the Trojan place of assembly, concealed in the Horse.\nThe Trojans themselves had hauled it into the citadel, and\nwith it standing there they made many indecisive speeches\nsitting around it. Three proposals found supporters:\nto cut through its hollow timbers with the pitiless bronze,\nto drag it up to the summit and push it over the edge,\nor leave it as a great offering to propitiate the gods—\nwhich in the event, was what was destined to happen,\nfor it was their fate to perish when the city enfolded\nthat great horse of wood, in which sat all the best\nof the Argives, bringing the Trojans massacre and death.\nHow the Achaians’ sons then sacked the city he sang,\nas they poured from the horse, leaving their hollow ambush;\nhow they variously laid the steep city waste as they fought\nthrough it: how Odysseus, like Ares, together with godlike\nMenelaos pressed on to the house of Deiphobos. There\nit was, he said, that he dared his most terrible battle,\nand won in the end through the aid of great-hearted Athene.\nThis was the lay the far-famed minstrel sang. But Odysseus\nmelted: tears from under his eyelids wet his cheeks.\nAnd as a woman wails and clings to her dear husband\nwho’s fallen fighting to save his city and his people,\nwarding off from township and children the pitiless day,\nand she sees him dying and gasping for breath, collapses\non him, shrieking aloud, while enemies behind her\nbatter her back and shoulders with their spears,\nand drag her away into slavery, to a life of toil and grief,\nwhile with most pitiful sorrow her cheeks are wasted—\nsuch pitiful tears Odysseus now shed beneath his brows.\nHis weeping escaped the notice of all the others; only\nAlkinoos was aware of it and took notice, since he sat\nbeside him, and could hear his heavy sighing. At once\nhe addressed himself to the Phaiakians, oar-lovers all:\n“Listen, you leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\nand let Demodokos silence his clear-toned lyre,\nfor the lay he’s singing does not please every listener.\nSince we began our feast, and the divine singer arose,\nhe’s never—I mean the stranger—ceased from heartfelt\nlamentation: some great grief must have assailed his mind!\nThen let the minstrel stop, so we all can enjoy ourselves,\nboth hosts and guest: this is much the better way, since\nit’s for our respected guest all this has been laid on:\nhis conveyance, the kindly gifts we’ve given him as friends.\nDear as a brother the stranger and suppliant is regarded\nby any man whose wits have the slightest grasp of wisdom.\nDo not, therefore, stranger, hide behind deceptive phrasing\nthe true answers to what I shall ask you: best to speak plainly.\nTell me the name by which your mother and father\ncalled you back there, and the others in your town and district,\nfor there’s none of mankind is wholly without a name,\nneither common nor noble, from the time he was born,\nbut at their birth their parents fasten names on them all.\nAnd tell me your country, your district and your city,\nthat our ships may convey you thither, steering by their wits—\nfor among the Phaiakians there exist no steersmen,\nnor indeed steering oars, such as other vessels possess;\nthe ships themselves understand men’s purposes and minds,\nand know all the cities of men, their fertile plowland,\nand the gulf of the salt deep they traverse most speedily,\nhidden in mist and cloud; nor do they ever have\nthe slightest fear of encountering damage or shipwreck.\nYet once I heard a story related by my father,\nNausithoos: he used to say that Poseidon was angry\nwith us, because we give safe convoy to all and sundry.\nOne day, he said, a most beautiful Phaiakian vessel\nreturning from escort duty out on the misty deep,\nhe’d smite, and hide our city with a great mountain round it.\nSo said the old man; the god will either fulfill this\nor leave it unfulfilled, as the fancy takes him. But come,\ntell me this, and give me a true account of it: where\nhave your wanderings taken you, to what countries\nof men have you come, their people, their populous cities,\nwhether rough and wild and uncivilized, or those\nthat welcome strangers, and have god-fearing minds !\nAnd tell me what makes you weep and lament at heart\nas you hear the fate of the Danaan Argives, of Ilion:\nthis the gods fashioned, and spun the thread of destruction\nfor mankind, that there might be a song for those yet to come.\nDid some kinsman of yours, perhaps, lose his life before Ilion?\nSome fine warrior, wife’s father or son-in-law, those\nwho are closest to you after your own flesh and blood? Or was it\na comrade maybe, one especially dear to you,\nthis fine warrior? For in no way less than a brother\nis he who’s a comrade and whose mind embraces wisdom.”\n",

         "\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Alkinoos, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\nit is indeed a good thing to listen to such a minstrel\nas this man is, who resembles the gods in his singing!\nThere is, I’d say, no greater fulfillment of pleasure\nthan when all the people share a common enjoyment,\nand those feasting in the halls are listening to a minstrel\nas they sit there in order, and all the tables are loaded\nwith bread and meat, and the cupbearer draws off wine\nfrom the bowl, and pours it into the cups. Indeed,\nto me this seems the very best kind of occasion.\nBut your spirit has moved you to ask about my unhappy\ntroubles, that I may weep and sigh still further.\nWhat then shall I tell you first, what later? The heavenly\ngods have laid on me sorrows past counting. First,\nnow, I’ll tell you my name, that you all may know it,\nand afterwards, if I escape the pitiless day, I may\nin turn be your host, far off though I make my home.\nI am Odysseus, Laertes’ son, well known to all mankind\nfor my crafty devices: my fame goes up to heaven.\nMy home is in sunny Ithake: there’s a mountain on it,\na landmark, Neriton, leaf-clad; and around it are many\nislands, set close each one to its next neighbor—\nDoulichion, Same, and forested Zakynthos.\nIthake itself lies low in the sea, furthest out toward\nnight, but the rest are apart, nearer dawn and sunrise.\nIt’s rough land, but fine for raising young men. Myself,\nI can’t think of a sweeter sight than one’s own country.\nKalypso, bright among goddesses, kept me with her, it’s true,\nin her hollow caves, wanting me for her husband;\nand Kirke likewise detained me in her halls,\nthat wily Aiaian lady, wanting me for her husband;\nbut neither could ever persuade the heart in my breast—\nso sure as nothing’s sweeter than a man’s own country\nand forebears, though he may live far away in a rich home\nin some foreign land, and quite remote from his parents.\n“But come, let me tell you now of the grief-laden homecoming\nthat Zeus afflicted me with on my way back home from Troy.\nFrom Ilion the wind drove me, brought me to the Kikones,\nto Ismaros. There I sacked the city, slaughtered the men.\nFrom the city we took both the wives and a heap of goods\nand divided them. I made sure none got less than a fair share.\nThen I was all for us light-footing it out of there,\nand so urged; but the rest, the great fools, refused to listen.\nThen much wine was drunk, and many a sheep they slew\nalong the shore, many crumple-horned shambling steers.\nThe Kikones meanwhile had gone and appealed to other Kikones,\ntheir neighbors—more numerous, and more courageous too,\nwho dwelt on the mainland, and knew all about fighting\nfrom chariots as well as, where necessary, on foot.\nThey came now, as thick as leaves and flowers in season,\nat dawn: then indeed an ill fate from Zeus beset us,\nout of luck as we were, brought us a mass of troubles.\nBy the swift ships they stood and fought: each side\nattacked the other with their bronze-tipped spears.\nWhile it was morning still, while the sacred day increased,\nwe stood firm and held them off, despite their numbers;\nbut once the sun had reached the hour for unyoking oxen,\nthen the Kikones broke the Achaians and overwhelmed them,\nand six of our well-greaved comrades from each ship\ndied, but the rest of us dodged death and destiny. So\nwe sailed on from there, lamenting at heart, but glad\nat having got clear of death, though we’d lost our comrades.\nNor did I let our curved ships proceed any further\nuntil we’d all called out three times to each of our luckless\ncomrades who’d died on the plain, cut down by the Kikones.\nYet against our ships cloud-gathering Zeus still roused\nthe north wind, with an awesome tempest, and hid\nboth land and deep sea behind clouds: night sprang from heaven.\nOur ships were driven on sidelong, fragments—three, four—\nwere ripped from the sails by the violence of the wind.\nSo, scared of destruction, we lowered them to the deck,\nand rowed our way hastily landward. There for two\nnights and two days continuously we lay to,\neating our hearts out with sorrow and sheer exhaustion;\nbut when fair-haired Dawn brought on the third day, then\nwe stepped the masts, hoisted the white sails, and took\nour seats: the wind and the helmsmen steered our vessels.\nAnd then unscathed I would have come back to my own country;\nbut as I was rounding Cape Malea the waves and the current\nand the north wind drove me off course, sent me past Kythera.\nFor the next nine days I was borne on by deadly winds\nover the fish-rich sea; on the tenth I set foot\non the land of the Lotus-Eaters, who feed off a flowery food.\nHere we went ashore and replenished our store of water,\nand my comrades now had a meal, there by the swift ships.\nBut when we’d gotten our fill of food and drink,\nthen I sent out some comrades to go ahead and discover\nwhat kind of people, among earth’s bread-eaters, dwelt here—\ntwo men I chose, and a third to go with them as herald.\nThey went straight off, and soon found the Lotus-Eaters;\nand these Lotus-Eaters, far from wanting to kill\nour comrades, offered them lotus to eat. Now none\nwho consumed the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus any longer\nhad the urge to bring news back or continue the voyage,\nbut were set upon staying right there, with the Lotus-Eaters,\nmunching lotus, their homecoming all forgotten.\nThese men I myself dragged weeping back to the ships,\nand tied them up below deck in the hollow vessels,\nand ordered all the rest of my trusty companions\nto board the swift ships without delay, lest any\nby eating the lotus should forget their homecoming.\nSo they quickly embarked, and, seating themselves at the rowlocks,\nranged in good order, struck the grey brine with their oars.\n“From there we sailed on further, grieving at heart, until\nwe reached the Kyklopes’ country—an arrogant, lawless\npeople who, relying upon the immortal gods,\nwith their own hands plant nothing, nor do they plow;\nbut everything flourishes for them, unplowed, unsown:\nwheat and barley, and vines that bear rich clusters\nof grapes; and the rain of Zeus makes them grow. They have\nneither assemblies for counsel nor established customs,\nbut make their homes near the summits of high mountains\nin hollow caves, and each man lays down the law\nto his children and wives: they care nothing for one another.\n“A fertile island’s spread out there, beyond the harbor,\nneither near the Kyklopes’ land, nor yet remote from it,\nwell wooded: on it countless wild goats flourish,\nfor no human comings and goings get in their way,\nnor do hunters disturb them, men who have it rough\ntracking game in the woodland over the mountain tops;\nnor is it grazed on by flocks or put under the plow,\nbut unsown and unplowed all its days it stays bereft\nof humankind, supports nothing but bleating goats.\nFor the Kyklopes have no vermilion-cheeked vessels,\nnor in their land are there shipwrights, who might build them\nwell-benched ships that could answer all their needs,\ntake them to other men’s countries (as often enough\nmen traverse the sea in ships to call upon one another)—\nmen who could also develop the island for them,\nfor it’s far from poor and could grow every crop in season:\non it are meadows, beyond the banks of the salt-grey sea,\nsoft and well watered: vines would never lack moisture,\nthe earth’s good for plowing, they could reap deep-standing\nharvests in season, so rich is the subsoil. Here too\nis a good safe harbor, with no need of moorings, either\nanchor stones to throw out or stern warps to secure:\none can just beach one’s vessel and wait till the crew are minded\nto put to sea, and get a soft following wind.\nAt the head of the harbor there’s bright water flowing,\na spring from under a cave, with poplars growing round it.\nThere we sailed in, and some god gave us guidance\nthrough the murky night, for there was no light to see by:\na deep mist lay round the ships, nor did the moon\nshed any light from heaven, but was obscured by clouds.\nNone got a glimpse of that island, nor could we see\nthe long breakers rolling in on the shore, until\nwe beached all our well-benched vessels, and, that done,\nlowered the sails on each one of them, and ourselves\nthen disembarked on the seashore, and lay down\nto sleep, and awaited the coming of dawn and brightness.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nwe went exploring the island, in amazement at it,\nand the nymphs, the daughters of aegis-bearing Zeus,\nsent out the mountain goats, to give my comrades dinner.\nAt once we took from the ships curved bows and long-socketed\ngoat-spears, and forming ourselves into three groups\nwent hunting, and right off some god provided us\nwith a most satisfactory bag. Twelve ships came with me,\nand each got nine goats by lot; for me alone they chose ten.\n“So then for the rest of the day until the sun went down\nwe sat eating abundant meat and drinking the sweet wine,\nfor not yet was all the red wine in our ships consumed,\nbut some remained; each crew had drawn off a great deal\nin jars, when we sacked the Kikones’ sacred citadel.\nNow we were looking across at the nearby Kyklopes’ country—\nsaw smoke, heard their voices, the bleat of their sheep and goats.\nBut when the sun had set and darkness came on,\nthen we lay down and slept along the line of the shore.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nI called an assembly and declared before them all:\n‘The rest of you stay here now, my trusty comrades:\nI with my own ship and my own crew will go over\nand find out about these men—who they may be,\nwhether they’re violent creatures, savage, and lawless,\nor hospitable people, men with god-fearing minds.’\n“That said, I boarded my vessel, ordered my companions\nto embark themselves, and to cast off the stern warps.\nThey came aboard quickly, seated themselves at the rowlocks,\nand sitting in order struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\nBut when we got to the place, quite near at hand, there at\nthe land’s edge, close to the sea, we saw a cave,\nhigh, overgrown with laurels, where abundant flocks\nof sheep and goats spent the night. Around it a high\nwall had been built, with stones sunk deep in the ground,\nand long timbers of pine and lofty-crested oak.\nThere a monstrous man had his dwelling, who all alone\nherded his flocks far off, consorted with no others,\nbut lived by himself, mind bred in lawlessness:\na monstrous wonder, resembling not so much\nany bread-eating mortal, but rather the wooded peak\nof some lofty mountain, standing out apart from the rest.\n“Then I ordered the rest of my trusty comrades to stay there,\nwhere they were, by the ship, and to stand guard over it;\nbut I, having chosen the twelve best among my comrades,\nwent on, taking a goatskin full of the sweet dark wine\nthat Maro gave me—Maro, Euanthes’ son and priest\nof Apollo, the guardian of Ismaros—because we had\nprotected him, together with his wife and his child,\nout of reverence: his dwelling was in a wooded grove\nof Phoibos Apollo, and he gave me splendid gifts:\nof fine-wrought gold he bestowed on me seven talents,\nwith a mixing bowl all of silver, besides the wine,\nwith which he filled a dozen large jars in all,\nsweet and unmixed, a heavenly drink: not one\nof his house servants or handmaids had knowledge of it,\nonly himself, and his wife, and one woman, their housekeeper;\nand whenever they drank this honey-sweet red wine\nhe’d mix one cup of wine with twenty measures of water,\nand from the bowl would rise an aroma of marvelous\nsweetness—then indeed to abstain would be no pleasure!\nWith this wine I filled and took with me a sizable goatskin,\nand a leather bag packed with food, for my sharp mind sensed\nthat the man we were going to encounter, clad in huge strength,\nwas wild, with no knowledge of justice or civil rights.\n“So we quickly came to the cave, but did not find him\ninside: he was out, tending his fat flocks at pasture.\nThen we entered the cave, amazed by all we saw there:\nbaskets loaded with cheeses, pens full of lambs\nand kids. Each age-group was sorted out separately—\nthe older ones by themselves, the middlers likewise,\nthe newborn too. All the pans were brimming with whey,\nthe buckets and bowls, well wrought, that he used for milking.\nRight off, my comrades spoke up, implored me to take\nsome of the cheeses and leave, then quickly to drive\nkids and lambs from the pens back to our swift ship,\nand sail away over the deep salt sea. But I would not\nlisten—far better indeed had I done so!—for I wanted\nto meet this man, find out if he’d treat me as a guest.\nNo joy was he to my comrades when he did appear!\n“So we lit a fire, and made sacrifice, and ourselves\ntook some of the cheeses and ate them, sat there inside\nwaiting, till he returned with his flock, hefting a great\nload of dry firewood to serve him at suppertime,\nand dumped it down with a crash as he came inside.\nWe shrank back, terrified, into the back of the cave,\nwhile he drove his fat flocks into the roomy cavern—\nall, that is, that he milked; the males he left outside,\nhe-goats and rams, there in the deep yard. Then\nhe lifted and put in place a huge and massive\ndoor stone: not twenty-two four-wheeled wagons,\nstrong ones, would have sufficed to raise it off the threshold,\nsuch a towering mass of rock he set in the doorway!\nThen down he sat and milked the ewes and bleating she-goats,\nall in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\nNext, once he’d curdled half the white milk, he collected\nthe curds in wicker baskets and put them aside.\nThe remaining half he left in the pails, so it would be handy\nto take and drink, and be ready for him at supper.\nBut after he’d busied himself with these tasks, he rekindled\nthe fire, and caught sight of us, and questioned us, saying:\n‘So, strangers, who are you? From where was it you sailed here\nover the watery ways? On business? Or do you rove at random,\ncruising the sea like pirates, who, at risk of their own lives,\ngo around making trouble for men from other lands?’\n“So he spoke, and we succumbed to panic in our hearts,\nterrified by his deep voice and his monstrous person;\nyet even so I responded, and addressed him, saying:\n‘We are, if you please, Achaians, driven wandering from Troy\nby all the winds, across the great gulf of the sea,\nseeking our homes, but blown on a different route,\nthe wrong paths: Zeus, I guess, must have planned it thus.\nWe are, we claim, men serving Atreus’ son Agamemnon—\nwhose fame now is unsurpassed under heaven, so great\na city he sacked, so many people he slew! But we\nwho come to you now are suppliants, clasp your knees,\nhoping you’ll treat us as guests, or in some other way\ngive us some kind of present, as is proper with strangers.\nKind sir, revere the gods! We are here as your suppliants,\nand Zeus is the protector of suppliants and strangers,\nthe strangers’ god, who looks after respectful guests.’\n“So I spoke. And he with pitiless heart responded:\n‘You’re a fool, stranger, or you must come from far away,\ntelling me either to fear or to steer clear of the gods!\nThe Kyklopes pay no attention to Zeus of the aegis,\nnor to the blessed gods—we’re far mightier than they!\nNor would I, to avoid the wrath of Zeus, spare either\nyou or your comrades, unless the spirit so moved me!\nBut where, coming here, did you leave your well-built ship?\nFar off was it, or nearby? Tell me: I’d like to know.’\n“So he spoke, testing me; but I knew too much to be tricked,\nand when I replied it was with guile of my own:\n‘My ship was broken up by Poseidon the Earth-Shaker,\nwho cast it upon the rocks at the frontier of your country:\nclose to the headland he drove it: the wind brought it ashore.\nBut I, and these men here, eluded sheer destruction.’\n“So I spoke. He, with ruthless heart, made me no answer,\nbut sprang up, laid hands on my comrades, grappled two,\nand down on the ground, as though they were mere puppies,\ndashed them: their brains spilled earthwards, wetted the floor.\nThen limb from limb he tore them to prepare his supper,\nand devoured them like a mountain-bred lion, leaving nothing—\ninnards and flesh, bones with the marrow in them,\nwhile we, lamenting, reached out our hands to Zeus\nat the sight of such bestial deeds. Helplessness overmastered\nour hearts. When the Kyklops had glutted his vast belly\nby gobbling human flesh, washed down with unmixed milk,\nhe settled to sleep in the cave, stretched out among his sheep.\nSo I planned an attack on him in my great-hearted spirit:\nI’d steal up close, draw the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\nand drive it into his breast, where the midriff cups the liver,\nfinding the spot with my hand. But a second thought stopped me—\nwe too would have perished there, faced sheer destruction,\nfor we could never have thrust back from the lofty\nentrance with our bare hands the huge stone he’d set there,\nand so, lamenting, we lay there, awaiting the bright Dawn.\n“As soon as Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nhe rekindled the fire, and began milking his fine flocks,\nall in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\nThen after he’d briskly accomplished his various tasks\nhe again grabbed two men together, and readied his meal.\nWhen he’d eaten, he drove his fat flocks out of the cave,\neasily shifting the enormous door-stone, and afterwards\nsetting it back in place, like the lid on a quiver.\nThen, whistling loudly, the Kyklops steered his fat flocks\nuphill, and I was left there, planning mischief deep in my heart—\nto get back at him, have Athene let me boast of what I’d done!\n“Now this was the plan that seemed, to my mind, the likeliest:\nThe Kyklops had left a great club beside a sheep pen,\nof green olive wood, that he’d cut to carry with him\nwhen it had dried out. Eyeing this, we compared it\nin size to the mast of a black ship of twenty oars,\na broad-beamed merchantman, one that crosses the great\nsea gulf—so huge did its length and breadth look to us.\nI went and chopped off a piece about a fathom long:\nhanded this to my comrades, told them to scrape it down,\nand they made it smooth, while I stood there and sharpened\nits point, then took and hardened it in the blazing fire,\nand stowed it out of sight, hiding it under the dung\nthat was strewn throughout the cave in heaped-up piles.\nI ordered the others to cast lots to decide\nwhich ones would dare, with me, to hoist up this stake\nand ram it into his eye, when sweet sleep overcame him.\nThe lot picked out the same ones whom I’d have chosen,\nfour of them; with these, as the fifth, I picked myself.\n“In the evening back he came, herding his fine-fleeced flocks,\nand straightway drove his fat flocks into the wide cave—\nall of them, left none outside in the deep enclosure:\nsome idea of his own, perhaps—or a god’s command?\nHe lifted and put in place the huge and massive door-stone,\nthen sat down and milked the ewes and bleating she–goats,\nall in turn, and set each lamb and kid to its mother.\nThen after he’d briskly accomplished his various tasks\nhe again grabbed two men together, and readied his meal.\nIt was now that I spoke to the Kyklops, going and standing\nbeside him, in my hands an ivy-wood bowl of dark wine:\n‘Here, Kyklops, drink this wine, now you’ve fed on human flesh,\nand learn what fine wine it is that’s stowed aboard our ship:\nI was bringing it as a libation, hoping you’d feel pity\nfor me, and send me on homeward; but your mad fury\nis not to be borne! Cruel wretch, how in future will any man\nin the world come near you? What you’ve done is an outrage.’\n“So I spoke. He took the wine, drained it, was vastly pleased\nas he swilled the sweet stuff, demanded a second bowlful:\n‘Quick, give me some more—and also tell me your name,\nnow, at once! I want to give you a guest-gift you’ll enjoy!\nFor the Kyklopes too the grain-giving earth bears vines\nwith rich clusters of grapes, and Zeus’ rain makes them grow;\nbut this—this is a match for ambrosia and nectar!’\n“So he spoke; and I once more brought him the bright wine.\nThree bowlfuls I fetched and gave him, three times in his folly\nhe drained them. Then, when the wine had fuddled his wits,\nI addressed him with honey-sweet words, saying: ‘Kyklops,\ndo you ask me my famous name? Very well, I will tell you—\nand then you give me that guest-gift, just as you promised!\nNobody is my name, Nobody’s what I’m called by\nmy mother and father and all my comrades.’\n“So I spoke,\nand at once he with pitiless heart responded: ‘Nobody\nI shall eat last of all, when I’ve had all his companions,\nand the others first: so, that will be your guest-gift.’\n“So saying, he swayed and fell on his back, lay sprawling\nwith his thick neck twisted sideways: overmastering sleep\npossessed him, from his gullet there gushed out wine\nand gobbets of human flesh, as he drunkenly vomited.\nIt was now that I thrust the stake deep into the embers\nto let it get hot, and encouraged all my companions\nwith heartening words, lest any back off from fear.\nThen, just as the olive-wood stake, though green, was about\nto catch fire, and was glowing, intensely incandescent,\nI leaned close, pulled it clear of the flames. My companions\ncrowded around me. Some god breathed great courage into us.\nThe others grasped the olive-wood stake, sharp-pointed,\nand rammed it into his eye, while I leaned over it,\nand twisted it round. As when a man with a drill\nbores a ship timber, and those below keep it turning\nwith a strap held at either end, and the drill runs nonstop—\njust so we grasped and in his eye kept turning\nthat fire-sharpened stake: round the red-hot orb blood ran.\nEyelids and eyebrows alike were singed by the fiery breath\nfrom the burning eyeball: its roots now crackled in the heat.\nAs when a blacksmith plunges a great axe or an adze\nin cold water to temper it, and it hisses loudly—\nfor this is how iron achieves its greatest strength—just so\ndid his eye now hiss around the olive-wood point. He gave\na terrible scream, that made the rock resound,\nand we shrank back in terror. He tore the stake, all slobbered\nwith fresh-shed blood, from his eye, and with both arms\nhurled it from him, maddened with pain, and screamed aloud\nto the other Kyklopes, those who were his neighbors,\ndwelling in caves near the windswept mountaintops,\nand they heard him cry out, and gathered from all around,\nand stood by the cave and asked him what was the matter:\n‘What great hurt, Polyphemos, is it makes you scream like that\nthrough the ambrosial night, and rouse us all from sleep?\nSurely no mortal is rustling your flocks against your will?\nSurely you’re not being murdered by guile or by force?’\n“From within\nthe cave mighty Polyphemos answered them thus: ‘My friends,\nNobody’s killing me by guile, not by force.’ To this,\naddressing him with winged words, they now responded:\n ‘If no one is harming you, then, and you’re alone, there’s no\nway you can dodge a sickness sent by great Zeus: you must\njust offer up prayers to our father, Lord Poseidon.’\n“So they spoke,\nand departed. I laughed in my heart at the way that name,\nand my faultless planning, had so deceived them. Meanwhile\nthe Kyklops, groaning and suffering agonies of pain,\ngroped with his hands, took the stone from the cave’s entrance,\nand sat there in the opening with both arms wide outstretched,\nhoping to catch anybody who tried to slip out with the sheep—\ndid he really suppose I was going to be that stupid?\nBy now I’d figured out just what I would have to do\nto find an escape from death both for my companions\nand for myself: I’d thought of every trick and device\nthat might save our lives: the threat was great and immediate.\nNow this, to my mind, looked the best of such plans:\nThere were the rams, well-nourished and thickly fleeced,\nfine strapping specimens, the wool on them violet-dark.\nThese I silently tied together with pliable withies—\non which the Kyklops, bred in lawlessness, would sleep—\ntaking three at a time: the middle one carried a man,\nwhile the ones on each flank gave my comrades protection:\nthus each three sheep bore one person. As for myself,\nthere was one special ram, the best in the whole flock:\nhim I grasped by the back, curled up under his shaggy belly,\nand lay with my hands twisted into his marvelous fleece,\nholding on tight, with great patience, never relaxing.\nAnd so, lamenting, we lay there, awaiting the bright dawn.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthen the males of the flocks sallied out of the cave to pasture,\nwhile the ewes went bleating about their pens, unmilked,\nwith bursting udders. Their master, in agonizing pain,\nkept feeling along the backs of all his sheep\nas they stood before him. The booby never perceived\nthat under his rich-fleeced sheep there were men tied on!\nLast of the flock the ram approached the entrance, heavy\nwith his thick wool—and with me and my quick thinking!\nGroping his back, the strong Polyphemos addressed him, saying:\n‘Dear ram, why do you come thus through the cave, the very\nlast of the flock? You used not to lag behind the others,\nbut were always first out, to graze on the lushest pasture,\nstriding ahead, the first to reach the flowing river,\nthe first that liked to head back into the sheepfold when\nevening came on. But now you’re the last of all. Are you mourning,\nmaybe, your master’s lost eye, which a wicked man put out,\nhe and his wretched fellows, when he’d doused my wits with wine—\nNobody—who, I tell you, is not clear of destruction yet !\nIf you only could think as I do and had the power of speech\nto tell me where that creature is hiding away from my might,\nthen would his brains, dashed out, lie scattered over the ground\nthroughout the cave, and my spirit would be lightened\nof all the ills which that nothing-worth Nobody’s brought me.’\nSo saying, he let the ram go on out through the entrance.\n“When we’d moved on a little way from the cave and the enclosure,\nfirst I loosed myself from the ram, then untied my comrades.\nQuickly then we drove off the fat, smart-stepping sheep,\nglancing back all the time, until we reached our ship.\nA welcome sight to our dear comrades were those of us\nwho’d escaped death: for the others they started wailing.\nBut this I stopped, with a silent upward jerk of the head\nthat said ‘No’ to their weeping. I told them to throw on board,\nfast, all the fine-fleeced sheep, and to put to sea at once.\nThey came aboard quickly, each man to his rowlock, and seated\nin proper order they struck the grey brine with their oars,\nand when we had backed offshore as far as a man’s shout\nwould carry, I called out to the Kyklops with mocking words:\n‘Kyklops, it was, then, no weakling whose comrades you planned,\nby might and brute force, to eat in your hollow cave! In full\nwere your evil deeds to rebound on your own head, vile wretch,\nwho did not shrink from eating the guests in your house, for which\nZeus and the other gods have exacted requital from you.’\n“So I spoke, and my words made him yet more angry at heart,\nso that he wrenched off, and hurled at us, the peak of a lofty\nmountain, that fell just in front of our dark-prowed vessel,\nnarrowly missing the end of the steering oar: the sea\nsurged up under the falling rock’s impact, created\na wave that carried our vessel straight back shoreward,\na heaving swell from the deep, aimed directly at the land.\nBut I seized a very long pole in my hands and thrust us\nclear once more, and urgently signed to my comrades\nto row for dear life, and get us away from danger,\ngesturing with my head. They bent to their oars, and rowed.\nBut when, working hard at the sea, we’d doubled the distance,\nthen I shouted again to the Kyklops, though all around\nmy comrades with calming arguments tried stop me:\n‘Stubborn wretch, why so set on infuriating this savage?\nJust now he flung some missile seaward, drove our vessel\nback to land—indeed, we thought we were done for!\nIf he’d heard any one of us making a sound, or shouting,\nhe’d have broken our heads as well as the ship’s timbers\nwith a cast of some sharp glinting boulder, so mighty his arm!’\n“Thus they spoke, but could not shift my great-hearted spirit,\nand I answered him back, irate and resentful at heart:\n‘Kyklops, if any mortal, of all mankind, should ask you\nabout your eye’s unseemly blindness, tell them it was\nOdysseus, sacker of cities, who destroyed your eyesight:\nLaertes’ son, who calls Ithake his home.’\n“So I spoke,\nand he groaned aloud, and then responded to me, saying:\n‘Alas, that ancient prophecy has indeed come true for me!\nThere once was a prophet here, a great gentleman too—\nTelemos, Eurymos’ son, a man unmatched in seercraft,\nwho grew old as a diviner among the Kyklopes: he\ntold me that all these things would happen in time to come,\nthat by Odysseus’ hands I’d be deprived of my sight.\nBut I always thought it would be some tall and handsome\nhero who’d show up here, endowed with mighty strength:\nBut in fact it’s this puny, no-account weakling who’s\ndeprived me of eyesight after fuddling my wits with wine!\nCome back here, Odysseus, and let me offer you guest-gifts,\nand urge the famed Earth-Shaker to grant you conveyance home,\nfor I am his son, and he avows that he’s my father.\nHe himself, if he so chooses, will heal me—he, and none other,\nwhether one of the blessed gods or some mortal human.’\n“So he spoke, and I answered him, saying: ‘How I wish\nI had the power to strip you of breath and life, and send you\ndown to the realm of Hades, as surely as no one\nwill heal your eye, not even the Earth-Shaker himself.’\n“So I spoke, and he then prayed to the lord Poseidon,\nreaching out both his hands to the starry heavens: ‘Hear me,\nPoseidon, dark-haired Earth-Shaker, if I am truly\nyour son, if you avow yourself my father! Grant\nthat Laertes’ son, whose home is on Ithake,\nOdysseus, sacker of cities, shall not reach home—\nBut if it’s fated that he’s to see his loved ones again,\nto come back to his well-built house and his native land,\nmay he get there late, in bad shape, all his comrades lost,\nin a ship not his own, and be met with trouble in his home!’\n“So he spoke in prayer, and was heard by the dark-haired god.\nThen once more he hefted an even greater rock\nand swung and hurled it, putting huge force into the throw,\nand it landed only a little behind our dark-prowed vessel,\nnarrowly missing the end of the steering oar: the sea\nsurged up under the falling rock’s impact, created\na wave that carried our vessel straight on shoreward:\nand so we came back to the island where all our other\nwell-benched ships lay together, and around them sat\nour comrades in tears, forever awaiting our return.\nWhen we got there we ran up our vessel onto the beach,\nand ourselves disembarked upon the sandy strand.\nThe Kyklops’ sheep we fetched out from the hollow ship\nand allotted them so that no one got less than his fair share.\nBut the ram my well-greaved comrades allotted to me alone\nwhen the sheep were shared out, as a special prize: on the shore\nthis ram to Zeus, Kronos’ son, dark-clouded, omnipotent,\nI sacrificed, burned the thighs. But he ignored my offering:\nhe had in mind the destruction of all my well-benched ships,\nand every last one of my trusty comrades. So then\nthe whole long day until the going down of the sun\nwe sat feasting on meat in abundance and sweet wine;\nbut when the sun had set and darkness came on\nthen we lay down and slept along the line of the shore.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthen indeed I aroused my companions and ordered them\nto embark themselves, and to cast off the stern warps.\nThey came aboard quickly, seated themselves at the rowlocks,\nand sitting in order struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\n“So we sailed on from there, lamenting at heart, but relieved\nat having got clear of death, though we’d lost our comrades.”\n",

         "\n“To the isle of Aiolia then we came, where was the dwelling\nof Aiolos, Hippotas’ son, much loved by the deathless gods,\non a floating island: encircling it was a rampart\nof unbreakable bronze: the rock ran up sheer and smooth.\nTwelve offspring of his besides were established in his halls,\nSix daughters there were, and also six lusty sons:\nthe daughters he gave to the sons to be their bedfellows.\nThese always eat with their dear father and loving mother,\nand countless fine dishes are ready to hand before them.\nThe house smells of food, reechoes with their chatter\nevery day; but at nighttime, beside their modest wives,\nthey sleep under blankets upon their corded bedsteads.\nIt was, then, to their city and fine abode that we came,\nand for a full month he befriended me, asked about everything—\nIlion, Argive vessels, the homecoming of the Achaians,\nand I told him the whole story, just as it happened.\nWhen I asked him about our own journey, wanted his help\nin sending us on our way, he denied me nothing, furnished\nconveyance, gave me a bag he’d made from the flayed hide\nof a nine-year-old ox, in which he’d imprisoned the paths\nof the blustering winds: Kronos’ son had made him their steward,\nempowered to calm or arouse them, as he might choose.\nThis he put in my hollow ship, tied fast with a shining cord\nof silver, that let no breeze, however slight, escape.\nFor me, however, he sent a breath of the west wind to blow\nthat would bear ships and men home; but he wasn’t destined\nto bring this about: our own folly was what undid us.\n“For nine days on end we sailed, both by day and by night,\nand now on the tenth our homeland came into sight—\nclose enough indeed to see men tending their watch fires:\nthen it was that sweet sleep came upon me in my exhaustion,\nfor I’d handled the sheet throughout, wouldn’t let any other\ncrew member have it, to get us back home the sooner.\nBut my comrades had started to mutter among themselves,\nsaid I was bringing home gold and silver as presents\nfrom Aiolos, Hippotas’ great-hearted son; and thus\nwould one, with a sidelong glance, sound off to his neighbor:\n‘Look how this fellow is always loved and honored\nby all men, whatever city or land he comes to!\nMuch rich treasure he’s bringing back home from Troy\nout of the booty, while we, who went through the selfsame\nventure as he did, are returning empty-handed!\nAnd now he’s been given these further generous gifts\nby Aiolos, out of friendship! So let’s take a quick look\nand see how much gold and silver there is in that bag!’\n“So they spoke,\nand this evil advice of my companions was accepted.\nThey opened the bag, and all the winds rushed out—\na storm wind instantly seized them, bore them seaward\nweeping, away from their native land; and I,\nwaking, debated in my own blameless spirit\nwhether to plunge overboard, and perish in the deep,\nor to endure in silence, remain among the living.\nI held on and stayed, head covered, lying there\nin my ship. By this evil gale our vessels were carried\nright back to Aiolos’ island, my comrades lamenting.\n“There we went ashore and took aboard more water,\nand my comrades at once ate a meal beside the swift ships.\nBut when we’d gotten a taste of food and drink,\nthen I, taking with me a herald and one companion,\nmade my way to Aiolos’ famed abode, and found him\nat dinner, along with his wife and children. We entered\nhis house, and sat by the doorposts, at the threshold.\nThey were amazed to see us, and questioned us, saying:\n‘Why are you here, Odysseus? What mean god assailed you?\nWe dispatched you with all kindness, to ensure you’d come\nsafely to home and country, or wherever you wanted.’\n“So they spoke; and, grieving at heart, I then explained to them:\n‘My wretched companions undid me; they, and damnable\nslumber! My friends, help me now: you have the power.’\n“So I spoke, addressing them with conciliatory words;\nbut they remained silent. Then their father made this response:\n‘Leave this island at once, most abject of living creatures!\nIt’s not proper for me to aid or provide conveyance\nto a man whom the blessed gods abominate! Begone!\nYou come here as one marked out by divine hostility!’\n“That said, he dismissed me, groaning heavily, from his domain.\nSo from there we pushed on still further, grieving at heart,\nthe men’s spirit worn down by the hardship of rowing, since,\ndue to our folly, we no longer had a good wind behind us.\nFor six more days, then, we voyaged on, day and night,\nand on the seventh we reached the steep citadel of Lamos,\nLaistrygonian Telepylos, where shepherd greets shepherd\none driving his flock back home, out to pasture the other.\nThere a man that needed no sleep could earn a double wage,\nby both herding cattle, and tending white sheep, so close\ndo the paths of the night and the day run on together.\nWhen we reached the fine harbor there—a sheer cliff face\nran all the way round it from side to side, while two\nprojecting headlands, confronting each another, loomed large\nat the mouth, leaving only a restricted entrance—\nthen all the rest went on in with their well-curved vessels.\nand moored them there, snug inside the hollow harbor,\npacked side by side, for no wave ever stirred there,\neither great or small; all around was a bright calm.\nBut I alone held my black ship back outside\nat the furthest edge, hitched my cables to a rock;\nthen climbed to a rugged lookout point, and stood there.\nLooking round, I saw no cattle, no human activity, nothing\nexcept for a trace of smoke drifting skyward from the earth.\nSo I then sent out some comrades to go ahead and discover\nwhat kind of men, among earth’s bread-eaters, dwelt here:\ntwo men I chose, and a third to go with them as herald.\nThey went ashore and followed a beaten track, by which\nwagons would haul down wood to the city from the hilltops.\nOutside the city they met a girl who was drawing water—\nthe strapping daughter, this, of a certain Laistrygonian,\nAntiphates: she’d come down to the fair-flowing spring,\nArtakie, from which they carried their water into town.\nSo they approached her, spoke to her, asked her questions—\nWho was king of these people, and who were his subjects?\nShe promptly showed them her father’s high-roofed house.\nWhen they entered this famed domain, they found his wife at home,\nhuge as a mountain peak, and were horrified by her.\nShe at once summoned famous Antiphates, her husband,\nfrom assembly: he devised a miserable fate for them.\nOne of my comrades he grabbed, prepared him for dinner,\nBut the other two took to their heels, got away to the ships.\nThen he raised a cry through the city, and when they heard it\nthe powerful Laistrygonians thronged in from all around,\nthousands of them, resembling not human beings, but Giants!\nFrom the cliffs with boulders—each one a man-sized load—\nthey showered us: a ghastly sound rose up from the ships\nof men dying and tinber shattering. They speared them\nlike fishes, carried them off to have as their gruesome meal.\nBut while they were murdering those inside the deep harbor,\nI meanwhile, drawing the sharp sword from by my thigh\nwith it cut the stern cables of my dark-prowed vessel,\nand quickly called to my comrades, urging, commanding them\nto row for dear life, get us clear of disaster. They all,\nin terror of death ripped up the salt spume with their oar blades.\nAh, the joy of escaping those sheer cliffs, getting out to sea—\nfor my ship alone: all the rest now perished as they lay there.\n“So we sailed on from there, lamenting at heart, but glad\nat having escaped from death, though we’d lost our comrades;\nand we came to the isle of Aiaia, that was the home\nof fair-tressed Kirke, dread goddess of mortal speech—\nfull sister was she to the evil-minded Aietes,\nand both were begotten by Helios, bringer of light,\non Perse, their mother, whom Ocean had as his daughter.\nThere we put in to land with our ship, and silently steered her\ninto a well-sheltered harbor, with some god guiding us.\nThen, after disembarking, we lay there two days and nights\neating our hearts with out with fatigue and sorrow;\nBut when fair-tressed Dawn ushered in the third day, then\nI took my spear and my keen-edged sword, and quickly\nclimbed on up from the ship to a point with a good view\nin my search for signs of field work or of human voices.\nI got to a rocky outcrop, a lookout station, and stood there,\nand glimpsed smoke wavering up from the wide-wayed earth\nout of Kirke’s dwelling, through dense coppices and leafage.\nSo then I pondered, in my mind and spirit, whether—\nhaving seen fire and smoke—I should go and find out more;\nand as I reflected, it struck me that this was the best course:\nto go back to my swift ship first, and to the seashore,\ngive my comrades a meal, but then send them to investigate.\nBut as I went, and came close to my well-curved vessel,\nthen, too, some god, seeing me alone, felt pity,\nand sent, right into my path, a huge high-antlered stag\non his way from his forest range to drink at the river,\nsince the sun’s strong heat had got to him. As he emerged,\nI speared him, in mid-back, piercing his spine: the bronze\nspear now transfixed him, he uttered a dying cry\nand collapsed in the dust. The spirit fled from him. Then,\none foot on his back, I tugged the bronze spear out\nfrom the wound, left the carcass there on the ground,\nwhile I plucked still-growing stems and osiers, wove them\ninto a fathom-long rope, well twisted at either end,\nand, tying the feet of this monstrous beast together,\nslung it across my back, and went on to the black ship\nleaning upon my spear, since no way could I support it\nwith one hand upon my shoulder, so huge a brute it was.\nI dumped it in front of the ship, and spoke encouraging words\nto my comrades, addressing each individual in turn:\n‘Not yet, friends, for all our grief, shall we go down\nto Hades’ realm before our destined day arrives!\nSo come, while there’s still food and drink in our swift ship\nLet’s think about eating, not waste away from hunger!’\n“So I spoke: they at once paid heed to my words, uncovered\ntheir faces, and, on that shore by the unharvested sea,\nstared in awe at the stag: a huge beast it was indeed.\nBut when they’d feasted their eyes upon this spectacle\nthey washed their hands and made ready a truly splendid feast.\n“So the whole long day until the going down of the sun\nwe sat feasting on meat in abundance, drinking sweet wine;\nbut when the sun had set and darkness came on\nthen we lay down and slept along the line of the shore.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nI called an assembly and then addressed them all, declaring:\n‘Heed what I say, my comrades, for all your grim suffering!\nDear friends, we don’t know where darkness lies, or dawn,\nor where the sun that brings light to mortals goes down\nunder the earth, or rises; but let us take thought, quickly:\nIs there any course open to us? Myself, I do not think so.\nI climbed to a rugged lookout point and surveyed\nthe island. The boundless deep encircles it all around.\nIt’s low-lying land: I did see smoke, in the middle,\nwavering up through dense coppices and leafage.’\n“So I spoke, and their inner spirit was broken, as they\nrecalled the deeds of Antiphates, the Laistrygonian,\nand of the Kyklops, that gross-spirited man-eater.\nThey wept aloud and shed thick-flowing tears,\nbut all their lamenting accomplished nothing for them.\n“I divided my well-greaved comrades into two groups,\nchose a leader for each of them: I myself took command\nof one, put godlike Eurylochos in charge of the other.\nNext, at once, we shook lots in a bronze helmet,\nand out leapt the lot of great-hearted Eurylochos.\nSo he set off, and took with him twenty-two comrades,\nall in tears; and the ones left behind were lamenting too.\n“They found, in a woodland glen, the house of Kirke, built\nof polished stone, and set in a space with a wide vista.\nProwling around it were mountain wolves and lions\nthat she had enchanted by feeding them evil drugs.\nThese beasts did not rush to attack my men, but instead\nfawned round them, rearing, swishing their long tails.\nIn the way that dogs, when their master’s coming from dinner,\nfawn round him, since he always has some tasty tit-bit for them,\nso round my men now fawned these strong-clawed wolves\nand lions. The men were afraid on seeing such scary monsters.\nSo there they stood in the sweet-haired goddess’ forecourt\nand heard Kirke singing inside in an enchanting voice\nas she went to and fro, weaving a great immortal web—\nfine work, exquisite, charming, as is that of all goddesses.\nFirst to find words was Polites, leader of men, the dearest\nto me of all my comrades, and the most devoted:\n‘Friends, there’s some lady inside, going to and fro at the loom\nand singing so sweetly that the whole floor echoes round—\ngoddess or woman, let’s call out to her!’\n“So he spoke,\nand they all clamored, calling out to her. She at once\nthrew open the shining doors, came out herself,\nand invited them in. They all, in their innocence, followed,\nexcept for Eurylochos: he, suspecting a trap, hung back.\nShe escorted them in, sat them down on chairs and benches,\nand offered them barley meal, cheese, and pale yellow honey\nmixed with Pramnian wine; but she added to this mixture\nbaneful drugs to destroy their memory of their homeland.\nWhen she’d given it them and they’d swallowed it, then at once\nshe struck them with her wand, and shut them away in sties:\nthey now all had pigs’ heads, pigs’ voices, and pigs’ bristles,\npigs’ bodies too; but their minds remained unchanged.\nSo they were penned in, weeping; and Kirke threw them\noak nuts to eat, acorns, the fruit of the cornel tree—\nsuch food as swine that sleep on the ground will feed on.\n“Now Eurylochos came straight back to our swift black ship\nto tell us the news of his comrades and their unkind fate.\nBut not one word could he utter, much though he longed to,\nso stricken with great distress was he in his heart; his eyes\nwere brimming with tears, his spirit brooded on lamentation.\nOnly after we questioned him, in our amazement, did he\nthen inform us about the fate of his other comrades:\n‘We went through the wood as you told us, noble Odysseus,\nand found, in a glen, a splendid house, constructed\nof polished stone, and set in a space with a wide vista.\nSomeone inside was going to and fro at a great web, singing\nsweetly, goddess or woman. We all called out to her.\nShe at once threw open the shining doors, emerged,\nand invited us in. The rest, in their innocence, followed.\nBut I held back, suspecting a trap, and they then\nvanished together—not one of them ever returned,\nthough I sat around long enough, watching out for them.’\n“So he spoke. I now slung my silver-studded sword—\nlarge, of bronze—from my shoulders, strapped on my bow\nand quiver, told him to lead me back the way he’d come.\nBut he clutched at my knees with both hands, besought me, wept,\nthen addressed me tearfully with winged words, saying: ‘Don’t\nmake me go back, Zeus’ nursling! Let me stay here!\nI know you’ll never come back yourself, or rescue\nany of your lost comrades! Let’s get out now, with those\nthat are here—we still may escape the day of doom!’\n“So he spoke;\nand I responded to him, saying: ‘Eurylochos you,\nyourself can remain here, right where you are, quite safe,\neating and drinking beside the black hollow ship; but go\nI myself must; a most powerful need is upon me.’\n“So saying, I went my way, up from the ship and the sea.\nI’d passed through the sacred glens, and was near the great\nhouse of Kirke, that expert in the use of countless drugs,\nwhen Hermes met me, god of the golden wand,\non my way to the house, in the likeness of a young man\nwith the first down on his face, when the charm of youth\nis greatest. He took my hand, and said: ‘Where are you off to\nagain, you hapless man, in the highlands, all alone,\nand ignorant of the country? Your comrades in Kirke’s house\nare caged up as pigs in her imprisoning sties. Are you\ncoming here to release them? I tell you, you yourself\nwill never escape, you’ll end up caught like the rest!\nBut see now, I shall free you from harm, and save you—\nHere, take this potent herb, have it with you when you go\nto Kirke’s house: it’ll keep the evil day from your head!\nAnd I’ll tell you all Kirke’s malevolent wiles: she’ll make you\na mixed posset, adding in drugs along with the foodstuff.\nYet not even so will she contrive to bewitch you: the potent\nherb that I’ll give you won’t let her. And I’ll tell you all\nyou must do. When Kirke strikes you with her long wand,\ndraw your sharp sword from beside your thigh, as though\nwith intent kill her. Then she, overcome by terror,\nwill invite you to bed down with her, make love together.\nYou must not, at this point, refuse the bed of the goddess\nif you want her to free your comrades and provide for you;\nbut make her swear a great oath by the blessed gods\nto plan no more nasty trouble against your person,\nlest when she has you naked she’ll weaken and unman you.’\n“So saying, the slayer of Argos gave me the herb,\npulling it out of the ground, and showed me its nature.\nAt its root it was black, but its flower was white as milk:\nMoly is what the gods call it: it’s hard for mortal men\nto dig up; but the gods can do whatever they’ve a mind to.\n“Hermes now departed to lofty Olympos, going\nup through the tree-clad island, while I made my way\nto Kirke’s house, my heart in a turmoil as I went.\nI stood in the forecourt of the fine-tressed goddess\nand standing there called to her. The goddess heard my voice,\nat once came out, flung open the shining doors\nand invited me in. Much troubled at heart, I entered.\nShe led me in and seated me on a silver-studded chair—\nbeautiful, finely crafted, with a footstool for my feet.\nThen she mixed me a posset in a golden cup,\nbut slipped a drug into it, with malevolence in her heart.\nWhen she gave it to me, and I drank it, yet was not bewitched,\nshe struck me with her wand, and had this word for me, saying:\n‘Off to the sty with you! Lie there with your other comrades!’\n“So she spoke. I drew the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\nand charged at Kirke, as though with intent to kill her.\nShe gave a loud scream, slipped under my charge, embraced\nmy knees, and, sobbing, addressed me with winged words, saying:\n‘Who are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\nI’m amazed that you drank my drug and were not bewitched!\nNo other man, ever, has failed to succumb to this drug\nonce he’d drunk it, once it had passed the barrier of his teeth!\nTruly, the mind in your breast is proof against all enchantment.\nYou must be resourceful Odysseus, who—so the slayer of Argos,\nhe of the golden wand, always told me—would visit here\nin his swift black ship, on his way back home from Troy!\nSo come, sheath your sword, let the two of us now go up\ninto my bed, and by mingling there together\nin the passion of love, find trust, each one in the other.’\n“So she spoke; but I answered her thus, with a question, saying:\n‘Kirke, how can you tell me to come and make love with you,\nwhen you’ve turned my comrades to swine, right here in your halls,\nand now you have me here, with malign intent you want me\nto go up into your chamber and your bed, so that when\nyou have me naked you can weaken and unman me?\nNever would I agree to come anywhere near your bed\nunless you, goddess, were to swear me a mighty oath\nthat you’d plan no more malicious trouble against my person.’\n“So I spoke. She at once swore the oath as I requested.\nBut not till she’d sworn, and completed the oath in full,\nwould I agree to go up into Kirke’s sumptuous bed.\nMeanwhile her handmaids were busy around the halls—\nfour of them, those who did all the housework in her home:\nnymphs, these, daughters of the springs and the groves,\nof the sacred rivers that flow to their outfall by the sea.\nOne was hanging fine purple cloths on the headrests\nof chairs and under them spreading white linen foot mats;\nanother was setting up silver tables beside the chairs\nand arranging golden baskets upon them; the third\nof these serving women was mixing sweet mind-honeying\nwine in a silver bowl and setting out golden goblets.\nThe fourth had fetched in water and lit a blazing fire\nbeneath a great cauldron: the water was getting hot.\nWhen it reached boiling point in the bright bronze vessel,\nshe got me into a bath, sluiced me down from the cauldron,\nmixing hot and cold to my taste, bathing head and shoulders\nto ease from my limbs their heart-crushing weariness.\nAfter she’d bathed me, and massaged me with rich oil,\nshe provided me with a splendid mantle and tunic,\nbrought me back, and seated me on a silver-studded chair—\nelegant, finely wrought—with a footstool for my feet.\nA maid brought hand-washing water in a beautiful golden\npitcher and poured it into a silver basin for me\nto wash with and drew up beside me a polished table.\nThe respected housekeeper now set bread beside me,\nwith many side dishes, giving freely of her supplies.\nThen she told me to eat, but I was not so minded:\nI sat brooding on other things: my heart sensed trouble.\n“Now when Kirke saw me thus sitting, not reaching out\nfor food, and overmastered by deep-felt distress, she came\nand stood close beside me, addressed me with winged words, saying:\n‘Odysseus, why are you sitting there like some voiceless person,\neating your heart out, touching neither food nor drink?\nDo you maybe anticipate some new trick? You don’t need\nto be afraid: I’ve already sworn that powerful oath.’\n“So she spoke:\nbut to her I then responded, saying: ‘Kirke, tell me,\nwhat kind of man is it, in his right mind, could bear\nto taste food or drink before he’d secured freedom\nfor his comrades, had seen them with his own eyes? If you\nreally mean it when you tell me to eat and drink, then free them!\nAnd let me set eyes myself on these, my trusty comrades.’\n“So I spoke. Kirke now made her way out through the hall,\nwand in hand, flung open the doors of the sty, and drove\nmy men out, embodied as hogs some nine years old.\nThey stood there before her, and she went in among them,\nanointing each one with a different magic salve, so that\nthe bristles earlier grown there by the deadly drug\nthat the lady Kirke had given them now sloughed off their limbs:\nmen they became again, more youthful than previously,\na great deal more handsome, much taller in their carriage.\nThey recognized me: each one of them clung to my hands.\nA yearning for lamentation came on us all, and the house\nechoed terribly round us: the goddess herself felt pity.\n“Then she, bright among goddesses, approached me and said:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\ngo down now to your swift ship, there on the seashore.\nFirst thing of all, haul your vessel high up upon the beach,\nthen store all your goods and equipment in the caves,\nthen come back yourself and bring your trusty comrades.’\n“So she spoke, and my proud spirit was persuaded.\nI made my way down to the swift ship and the seashore,\nand there by the swift ship I found my trusty comrades\nlamenting piteously and shredding big tears. As country\ncalves will come frisking about a herd of cows\non their way back to the dung yard, replete with fodder—\nin a mass they confront them, the pens no longer contain them,\nand endlessly lowing they keep scampering round\ntheir mothers—so these men, when they set eyes upon me,\nthronged round me weeping: it seemed to them in their hearts\nas though they’d got back to their homeland, to the actual\ntownship of rugged Ithake where they were born and bred.\nLamenting now they addressed me with winged words, saying:\n‘We’re as delighted, Zeus’ nursling, by your return, as if\nwe’d got back home to Ithake, to our native country!\nBut come now, tell us the fate of our other companions.’\n“So they spoke, and I gave them a reassuring response:\n‘First thing of all, haul our vessel high up upon the beach,\nthen store all our goods and equipment in the caves.\nThat done, you—all of you—come quickly along with me\nto the sacred halls of Kirke, where you’ll see your comrades\neating and drinking, from a never-failing abundance.’\n“So I spoke, and they were quick to obey my instructions.\nOnly Eurylochos tried to hold back all our comrades,\nand addressed them with winged words, saying: ‘You wretched\ncreatures, where are we going? Why long for these troubles,\nwhen going down into Kirke’s domain will surely\ntransform each one of us into swine or wolves or lions,\ncondemned, under obligation, to guard her great abode?\nThat’s how the Kyklops acted when our comrades entered\nhis farmstead and headstrong Odysseus went in with them:\nit was through this man’s recklessness that they too perished.’\n“So he spoke; I debated in my mind then whether I should\nunsheathe the long sword from beside my sturdy thigh,\nand cut off his head with it, lay him low, although\nclose kin by marriage he was to me; but my comrades\none after another with honey-sweet words restrained me:\n‘Scion of Zeus, give the order, and we’ll leave this man here\nto stay by the ship and to guard it; but as for us,\nwhat we want is for you to lead us to Kirke’s sacred abode.’\n“So saying, they started off then, up from the ship and the sea;\nnor was Eurylochos left behind by the hollow ship,\nbut came with the rest of us, fearing my strong reproof.\n“Meanwhile, back in her house, Kirke with loving care\nbathed the rest of my comrades, massaged them with rich oil,\nand dressed them up in fine wool mantles and tunics;\nwe found them all having a good dinner there in her halls.\nBut when my men saw and recognized one another,\nthey wept and lamented: the house reechoed around them.\nThen she, bright among goddesses, approached me and said:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\nno longer need you all raise this loud lament! I too know\nthe sum of the troubles you suffered out on the fish-rich deep\nand every wrong that’s been done you by hostile men on land.\nBut come now, eat your food and drink your wine, until\nyou once more recover that spirit you had in your breasts\nto begin with when you set out from your native land\nof rugged Ithake—but now you’re worn and dispirited,\nforever recalling your rough wandering, nor has your heart\nknown any joy, since indeed you’ve suffered greatly.’\n“So she spoke, and our proud spirits consented,\nand day after day, for the course of a whole year\nwe sat there feasting on plentiful meat and wine.\nbut when a year had passed, as the turning seasons\nof the months went by, and the long days came to an end,\nthen my trusty companions assailed me with their complaints:\n‘Are you out of your mind? High time to think of your homeland\nif it’s truly your destiny to be saved and to return\nto your high-roofed house and to your own native country.’\n“So they spoke, and my proud spirit consented.\nSo all day long until the setting of the sun\nwe sat there feasting on plentiful meat and sweet wine;\nbut when the sun went down and darkness came on,\nand they retired to sleep along the shadowy halls,\nthen I myself went up into Kirke’s sumptuous bed\nand clasped her knees in entreaty. The goddess heard\nand listened. I addressed her with winged words, saying:\n‘Kirke, fulfill for me now the promise you made, that you’d\nconvey me home: my spirit’s eager to be on its way,\nlikewise the rest of my comrades, who nag me to death\nas they grieve around me, whenever you’re somewhere else.’\n“So I spoke. Bright among goddesses, she at once replied:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\nyou all need stay in my house no longer against your will;\nbut there is another journey you must accomplish first:\nyou must go to the realm of Hades and dread Persephone,\nto consult the ghostly spirit of Theban Teiresias,\nblind seer, whose reasoning mind remains intact,\nsince on him alone, when dead, Persephone bestowed\nfull mental powers: the rest are only flitting shadows.’\n“So she spoke. But the spirit within me was shattered:\nI wept as I sat on the bed, and my heart no longer\nhad any desire to live, to behold the sunlight.\nBut when I’d had my fill of weeping and agonizing,\nI found the words to reply with, and addressed her, saying:\n‘Kirke, who will serve as our guide upon this journey?\nNo one yet in a black ship has ever voyaged to Hades.’\n“So I spoke. She, bright among goddesses, at once replied:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\ndon’t worry about installing a pilot aboard your ship—\nJust set up your mast, spread your white sail, and then\nsit down, and let the north wind carry you onward!\nBut when in your ship you’ve traversed the stream of Ocean,\nand come to a wooded shore and the groves of Persephone,\nwith their tall poplars, and willows that shed their fruit,\nthere beach your vessel, close by deep-eddying Ocean,\nand yourself go on to the dank domain of Hades. There\nit is that into Acheron Pyriphlegethon flows,\nand Kokytos, that branches off from the waters of Styx:\na rock marks the confluence of these two loud rivers.\nGo close in there, hero, exactly as I instruct you,\nand dig out a pit, about a cubit deep and wide,\nand around it pour a libation to all the dead—\nfirst with milk and honey, then with sweet wine,\nand thirdly with water: sprinkle white barley on it,\nand entreat the weak heads of the dead with many vows—\nthat when you’re back on Ithake you’ll sacrifice the best\nbarren heifer in your domain, load the pyre with good things,\nand, just for Teiresias, you’ll make a sacrifice\nof an all-black ram, the finest one in your flocks.\nThen, when you’ve supplicated the famous tribes of the dead,\nyou must slaughter a ram and a black ewe, making them face\ntoward Erebos, while you turn your back on them, reach out\nto the streams of the river. This is the place where many\nghosts of those who have perished will now gather.\nAt that point arouse your comrades, and command them\nto take the sheep that lie there, slain by the ruthless bronze,\nand flay and burn them, along with prayers to the gods—\nstrong Hades and dread Persephone. You yourself,\ndrawing the keen-edged sword from beside your thigh,\nmust sit there, and not allow the weak heads of the dead\nto get near the blood until you’ve questioned Teiresias.\nThe seer will then quickly approach you, leader of men:\nHe will show you your route, explain your journey’s stages,\nyour homecoming, how you’re to traverse the fish-rich deep.’\n“So she spoke; and at once the golden-throned Dawn arose.\nShe gave me a mantle to wear, and a tunic; and she, the nymph,\ndressed herself in a long white robe, made of finely\nwoven and beautiful stuff, and around her waist\nknotted a fine golden sash, set a veil on her head.\nNow I went through the house and aroused my comrades\nwith kindly words, approaching each man in turn:\n‘Lie no longer in bed enjoying sweet slumber! Time\nfor us to be going! Lady Kirke has briefed me fully.’\n“So I spoke, and their proud spirits consented. Yet not\neven from there could I get my comrades away\nwithout loss. The youngest, Elpenor—neither outstanding\nin battle nor yet particularly bright-minded—had\nlain down apart from his comrades in Kirke’s house,\nin search of cool air, being heavy with wine, on the roof.\nHearing the noise and clatter of his comrades stirring\nhe got up suddenly, and, quite forgetting that he should\nmake his way back down by way of the long ladder,\nfell headlong off the roof: his neck was snapped through\nat the spine, and his ghost went down to Hades’ realm.\n“As my men were bustling about I spoke among them, saying:\n‘You may think you’re on the way to your own dear country,\nbut Kirke’s informed me we must first make another journey,\nto the realm of Hades and of dread Persephone, there\nto consult the ghostly spirit of Theban Teiresias.’\n“So I spoke, and their spirit was shattered within them, they\nsat down wherever they were, and wailed, and tore their hair;\nbut all their lamenting accomplished nothing for them.\n“While we were on our way to the swift ship and the seashore,\nfull of sorrow and shedding big tears, meanwhile\nKirke had gone on ahead of us and tethered there,\nby the black ship, a ram and a black ewe,\novertaking us easily; when gods don’t desire it, who\ncan witness their passage, either coming or going?”\n",

         "\n“But when we came down to the ship and the sea, first off\nwe hauled our vessel into the bright salt water, and then\nstepped the mast, set the sail in the black ship, and took\nthe sheep and put them aboard, and ourselves embarked,\nfull of sorrow and shedding big tears. For us\nin the wake of our dark-prowed vessel a following breeze\nthat filled our sail, a trusty companion, was sent us\nby fair-tressed Kirke, dread goddess of mortal speech.\nSo when we’d secured the tackle throughout the ship we then\nsat down, leaving wind and steersman to keep her on her course.\nAll day long her sail spread taut as she sheared through the deep,\ntill the sun went down and all the ways were in shadow.\nShe came to the boundary marked by deep-flowing Ocean,\nwhere are the land and settlement of the Kimmerians,\nenveloped in mist and cloud: upon them never\ndoes the bright-gleaming sun look down with his rays,\neither while he’s climbing into the starry heavens\nor when he turns back again from heaven to earth,\nbut deathly night’s spread out over hapless mortals.\n“There we now came, and beached our ship. Unloading\nthe sheep, we made our way beside the stream of Ocean\nuntil we reached the place of which Kirke had told us.\nThere Perimedes and Eurylochos held the victims,\nwhile I unsheathed the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\nand dug out a pit, about a cubit deep and wide,\nand around it poured a libation to all the dead—\nfirst with milk and honey, then with sweet wine,\nand thirdly with water: I sprinkled white barley in it,\nbesought the weak heads of the dead with many vows—\nthat when I was back on Ithake I’d sacrifice the best\nbarren heifer in my domain, load the pyre with good things,\nand, for Teiresias only, would offer a sacrifice\nof an all-black ram, the finest one in my flocks.\nThen, when with vows and prayers I’d made my entreaties\nto the tribes of the dead, I took the sheep, cut their throats\nover the pit. The dark blood flowed, there came up out\nfrom Erebos the shades of corpses dead and buried:\nbrides, still-unmarried youths, toil-worn old men,\ntender young girls, their hearts still new to sorrow,\nand many with wounds inflicted by bronze-tipped spears,\nmen slain while fighting, still in their bloodstained armor—\nmany crowding around the pit from every quarter\nwith an eerie clamor. Pale fear took possession of me.\nBut still I called my companions, gave them orders to take\nthe sheep that lay there, slain by the ruthless bronze,\nand flay and burn them, along with prayers to the gods—\nstrong Hades and holy Persephone. I myself,\nunsheathing the sharp sword from beside my thigh,\nsat there, and would not allow the weak heads of the dead\nto come near the blood until I’d questioned Teiresias.\n“The first shade to come was that of my comrade Elpenor.\nNot yet had he been interred beneath the wide-traveled earth,\nfor we’d left his body behind in Kirke’s hall, unwept\nand unburied, since this other business was what now drove us.\nOn seeing him I wept, and my heart felt pity for him,\nand speaking with winged words, I addressed him, saying:\n‘Elpenor, how did you come here through the murky darkness?\nYou traveled faster on foot than I in my black ship.’\n“So I spoke. He groaned, and responded to me, saying:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\nsome god’s ill-will undid me—that, and too much wine!\nWhen I lay down to sleep in Kirke’s house I forgot\nI must make my way back down by the long ladder,\nso fell headlong off the roof: my neck was snapped through\nat the spine; my shade went down to Hades’ realm.\nNow I beseech you, by those left behind who are not here,\nby your wife, by the father who cared for you as an infant,\nby Telemachos, whom you left as the sole child in your halls—\nI know when you go on from here, leave the realm of Hades,\nyou’ll put in, with your well-built ship, at the isle of Aiaia.\nIt’s there, my lord, that I need your remembrance most—\nDon’t abandon me there unwept, unburied, lest I\nbecome the occasion of some god’s wrath against you!\nBurn me there, I beg you, with such armor as I possess,\nand heap me a burial mound by the shore of the grey sea,\nfor those yet unborn to learn of an unfortunate man.\nDo this for me, and set on my tomb the oar\nwith which I rowed, when alive, among my comrades.’\n“So he spoke, and I then answered him, saying: ‘All this,\nunhappy man, I’ll most surely carry out on your behalf.’\n“So the two of us sat there, exchanging these grim words,\nI on one side with my sword held over the blood,\non the other, addressing me, the wraith of my companion.\n“Then there drew near the ghost of my dead mother,\nAntikleia, daughter of great-hearted Autolykos,\nwhom I’d left alive when I first sailed for sacred Ilion.\nOn seeing her I wept, and pitied her in my heart;\nYet not even so, for all my deep sorrow, would I\nlet her come near the blood till I’d questioned Teiresias.\nAnd then he came, did the ghost of Theban Teiresias,\ngold staff in hand, and he recognized and addressed me:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\nwhy, hapless man, have you turned your back on the sunlight\nand come to gaze on the dead and their joyless region?\nStand back from the pit, and take your sharp sword away,\nso I can drink of the blood, and speak words of truth to you.’\n“So he spoke, and I drew back, returning my silver-studded\nsword to its sheath; only when he’d drunk the dark blood\ndid the matchless seer address me, saying: ‘Great Odysseus,\nyou want to know all about your sweet homecoming.\nThis a god will make hard for you: I do not foresee\nyou escaping the Earth-Shaker’s notice. He holds a grudge\nagainst you, is wrathful because you blinded his dear son.\nYet even so you can make it, though after much hardship,\nif you’re willing to curb your own and your comrades’ spirits\nfrom the moment you put in with your well-built ship,\nforsaking the violet deep, to the isle of Thrinakie\nand find there at pasture the cattle and well-fed sheep\nof Helios, the all-seeing, all-hearing sun. If you\nleave these unharmed and take care over your return\nyou may still get home to Ithake, after much suffering;\nbut should you harm them, then I foresee destruction\nfor your ship and your comrades. You yourself may escape,\nbut you’ll get home late and in bad shape, your comrades all lost,\nin a ship not your own, find troubles plaguing your house—\narrogant fellows installed there, devouring your livelihood,\nwooing your godlike wife and sending her bridal gifts!\nIndeed, when you come you’ll avenge their violent conduct,\nbut when you’ve killed off the suitors in your halls,\nwhether by guile or openly with the sharp bronze,\nthen you must set out again, taking a well-shaped oar,\nuntil you come among men who know nothing of the sea,\nwho eat their food without putting salt in it,\nand have never set eyes on ships with purple cheeks\nor on the well-shaped oars that serve as a ship’s wings;\nand I’ll tell you a very clear sign, one that won’t escape you:\nwhen on the road you meet another man who believes\nit’s a winnowing-fan that you have on your sturdy shoulder,\nthen fix your well-shaped oar on end in the ground,\nand offer a lavish sacrifice to the lord Poseidon—\na ram, a bull, and a stud boar that mounts its sows.\nThen go back home, and make rich sacred offerings\nto the immortal gods who possess broad heaven,\nin due order. Death will come to you from the sea,\nthe gentlest of ends, but will take you only after\nyou’ve worn out a sleek old age, with your people round you\nprospering. This that I tell you is the truth.’\n“So he spoke, and I then responded to him, saying:\n‘Teiresias, it may be that the gods have spun this thread.\nBut come, now tell me this, and answer me truthfully:\nI see before me the shade of my departed mother,\nsitting, silent, close to the blood. I am her own son,\nyet she’s not brought herself to look at me or address me!\nTell me, my lord, how may she know me for who I am?’\n“So I spoke, and at once he responded to me, saying:\n‘Very simple the answer I’ll give you and put in your mind:\nWhosoever of those that are dead and gone you permit\nto come up to the blood will converse with you truthfully;\nbut any that you refuse will go back to where they came from.’\n“So saying, the ghost of the lord Teiresias departed\nback to Hades’ domain, after stating the gods’ decrees;\nbut I waited steadfastly there, until my mother\ncame up and drank the dark blood, and knew me at once,\nand addressed me sorrowfully, with winged words, saying:\n‘My child, how did you penetrate this murky darkness\nwhile alive? Hard for the living to get to see these realms,\nfor between them lie great rivers, awesome streams,\nOcean above all, which may in no wise be crossed\non foot, but only with a well-found ship! Have your\nlong wanderings after Troy still brought you no further\nthan this with your ship and your comrades? Haven’t you yet\nreached Ithake, or seen your wife and your own domain?’\n“So she spoke, and I then responded to her, saying:\n‘My mother, need brought me down here to Hades’ realm:\nI had to consult the shade of Theban Teiresias.\nNot yet have I come near Achaia, not yet have I set foot\non my own land, I’ve been wandering, grief-stricken,\nsince I first followed the godlike lord Agamemnon\nto Ilion, home of fine horses, to fight against the Trojans.\nBut now tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\nWhat fated exit of death was it overcame you?\nSome wasting disease? Or did Artemis the archer\nwith her gentle shafts assail you and lay you low?\nTell me, too, of the father and son I left behind there—\nAre my privileges still with them, or does some other\nman now possess them? Do they say I’ll not return?\nAnd what of my wedded wife? Her thoughts? Her plans?\nHas she held on with her son? Kept everything as it was?\nOr is she now remarried, to the best man of the Achaians?’\n“So I spoke, and my lady mother answered me at once:\n‘Truly indeed she holds on with steadfast spirit\nthere in your halls: for her the nights and days\nwaste away in unending sorrow amid her tears.\nAs for your fine privileges, no man’s assumed them, although\nTelemachos now, unchallenged, possesses your acres,\nand orders the common feasts, as is right for a lawgiver\nwhom all men acknowledge. But your father stays away\nin the country, and never comes into town. He has\nno bed with proper bedclothes, rugs and bright coverlets,\nbut sleeps in winter along with the slaves in the house,\nin the ashes close to the fire, and wears old ragged clothes.\nBut when summer comes, and flourishing autumn, then\nall over the rising slope of his vine-clad orchard\nthe ground is strewn with the fallen leaves for his bed.\nThere he lies in his sorrow, heart nursing one great grief,\nyearning for your return: old age weighs heavy on him.\nThus it was that I too perished and met my fate:\nNeither in our abode did the deadly archer goddess\nlay me low in a visitation with her gentle shafts,\nnor did any disease come upon me, the kind most likely\nwith loathsome wasting to sever the spirit from my limbs:\nit was rather my yearning for you, illustrious Odysseus,\nfor your wisdom, your kindness, that robbed me of sweet life.’\n“So she spoke, and I wanted, pondering in my heart,\nto embrace the ghost of my mother, now dead and gone:\nthree times I moved to clasp her, as my heart urged me,\nthree times she eluded my arms, like some shadow or dream,\nso that the pain in my heart grew ever sharper,\nand I spoke, addressed her with winged words, saying: ‘Mother,\nwhy won’t you stay here when I want to hold you,\nso that even in Hades the two of us can cast arms\nabout one another, and get our fill of chill lamentation?\nIs this some phantom set on me by holy Persephone\nto add yet more to the weight of my grief and sorrow?’\n“So I spoke, and my lady mother answered me at once:\n‘Alas, my child, ill-fated beyond all other mortals,\nPersephone, daughter of Zeus, is in no way beguiling you.\nNo, this is the fixed law for mortals, when anyone dies:\nThe sinews no longer keep flesh and bones together,\nthey’re destroyed by the powerful force of blazing fire\nas soon as the spirit departs from the white bones\nand the soul, like a dream, flies fluttering off, is gone.\nBut quick, hurry back to the light now, with all these things\nstored in your mind, to tell your wife hereafter.’\n“So we two conversed together, and now the women\napproached us, those sent up by holy Persephone,\nall those who had been great chieftains’ wives or daughters.\nIn throngs now they all gathered around the dark blood\nwhile I considered how I should question each individual.\nAnd this, to my mind, emerged as the best plan:\nI drew the long sword from beside my sturdy thigh\nand would not let them all drink the dark blood together.\nSo they approached me in turn, one after the other.\nEach told me her lineage. I interrogated them all.\n“Now the first one that I saw there was high-born Tyro,\nwho said she was descended from peerless Salmoneus,\nand declared herself the wife of Aiolos’ son Kretheus.\nShe fell in love with divine Enipeus, the river,\nloveliest of all rivers that discharge their streams on earth,\nand she used to haunt Enipeus’ beautiful waters.\nAssuming Enipeus’ form, the Earth-Shaking Earth-Supporter\nlay with her at the outflow of the eddying river,\nand the dark wave stood up round them like a mountain,\narching over, concealing the god and the mortal woman.\nHe undid her virgin sash, shed sleep down on her,\nthen, when the god had completed the actions of love,\nhe clasped her hand and addressed her, saying: ‘Lady,\nbe glad of this lovemaking! As the time of the year comes round\nyou will bear fine offspring: not issueless are the couplings\nof the immortals! Look after these children, raise them.\nFor now, though, go back home, keep quiet, say nothing.\nBut know that I am Poseidon, the Earth-Shaker!’\n“So saying,\nhe plunged down into the billowing deep. And she\nindeed conceived, gave birth to Pelias and to Neleus,\nwho grew to become strong henchmen of mighty Zeus,\nboth of them: Pelias dwelt in Iolkos’ broad terrain,\nwith a wealth of flocks, and Neleus in sandy Pylos.\nOther sons this queen among women bore to Kretheus:\nAison, Pheres, Amythaon the joyful chariot fighter.\n“After her I saw Antiope, daughter of Asopos,\nwho boasted that she’d slept in the arms of Zeus himself,\nand bore him twin sons, Amphion and Zethos, who\nfirst laid the foundations of seven-gated Thebai,\nand walled it about, since lacking walls they could not\ndwell in broad-landed Thebai, powerful though they were.\n“After her I saw Alkmene, Amphitryon’s bedfellow,\nshe who conceived Herakles—bold fighter, lion-hearted—\nwhen she embraced and coupled with mighty Zeus.\nMegare too I saw, high-spirited Kreion’s daughter,\nwife to Amphitryon’s son, a man of unwearied strength.\n“Oedipus’ mother I saw, the beautiful Epikaste,\nwho unwittingly did a most terrible deed: she married\nher own son: he wed her after killing his father.\nStraightaway the gods revealed all this to mankind.\nYet he in his much-loved Thebai, though racked with grief,\nby the gods’ grim design still reigned over the Kadmeians,\nwhile she went down to the realm of Hades, strong gatekeeper,\nafter hanging a sheer noose from the lofty ceiling,\npossessed by her grief, bequeathing him countless woes,\nall that a mother’s Furies might bring to pass.\n“And I saw\nthe exquisite Chloris, that woman whom Neleus once\nwed for her looks, when he’d brought her endless bridal gifts;\nyoungest daughter she was of Amphion, Iasos’ son—\nwho once in Minyan Orchomenos ruled with a forceful hand—\nand queen of Pylos too: she bore him illustrious children:\nNestor and Chromios, Periklymenos the much-honored,\nand besides these she bore gorgeous Pero, a wonder to mortals.\nHer all the men living round sought in marriage. But Neleus\nwould bestow her on him alone who drove from Phylake\nthe broad-browed crumple-horned cattle of powerful Iphikles—\na hard lot they were, and none but the matchless seer\nundertook to drive them off; but a hard fate set by the god\nhampered him: that, and tough shackles, and those country cowherds.\nNevertheless, when the months and days were completed\nof the circling year, and the seasons in turn came round,\nhe was let go by powerful Iphikles, once he’d told him\nall the divine decrees. And a plan of Zeus was fulfilled.\n“Lede also I saw, the bedfellow of Tyndareus,\nwho bore to Tyndareus a pair of stout-hearted sons,\nhorse-breaker Kastor and Polydeukes the skilled boxer.\nBoth these, though living, the life-giving earth enfolds:\neven beneath the earth they have honor from Zeus—\nin turn, on alternate days, they live and are dead.\nThe honors bestowed upon them match those of the gods.\n“After her I saw Iphimedeia, Aloeus’ bedfellow,\nwho claimed she’d coupled in passion with Poseidon.\nTwo sons she bore, but both of them were short-lived:\nOtos, a match for a god, and far-famed Ephialtes,\nwho were the tallest men that this grain-rich earth yet bred,\nand the best-looking by far after renowned Orion.\nAt nine years old they measured a full nine cubits\nin breadth, and were nine fathoms tall. They even\nmade threats against the immortals on Olympos,\nthat they’d start up the conflict of impetuous warfare!\nOssa they longed to pile on Olympos, and on Ossa\nleaf-rippling Pelion, to scale the heights of heaven!\nAnd this they’d have done, had they come to full adulthood;\nBut the son of Zeus, whom neat-haired Leto bore, slew them:\nboth of them—this before the down grew beneath their temples,\nor covered their chins with a thick and healthy stubble.\n“And Phaidre and Prokris I saw, and beautiful Ariadne,\nbloody-minded Minos’ daughter, whom Theseus once\nbrought out of Krete to take to the hill of sacred Athens,\nbut had no joy of her, since before that Artemis slew her\non sea-girt Die, because of Dionysos’ indictment.\n“Maira I saw, and Klymene, and loathsome Eriphyle,\nwho took precious gold in exchange for her own husband—\nBut I neither can tell of nor name all the women I saw,\nthe wives and daughters of heroes; long before that\nthe immortal night would be gone. Now is the time\nfor sleep—either going aboard your swift ship to its crew\nor here. My conveyance will be the gods’ concern, and yours.”\nSo he spoke: every one of them sat hushed and silent,\nenthralled by his words, throughout the shadowy hall.\nWhite-armed Arete was the first to comment, saying:\n“Phaiakians, how does this man’s character strike you?\nHis looks, his stature, his equable inner mind?\nBesides, he’s my guest, though you all share that honor:\nSo don’t rush to send him away, or to cut short our gifts\nto one in such need; you have plentiful possessions\nstored in your halls through the good will of the gods.”\nThen there spoke up among them the old hero Echeneos,\nthe most aged of all the Phaiakian elders, saying:\n“My friends, not wide of the mark or of our own thinking\nis what our wise queen just said: pay attention to it—\nthough it’s on Alkinoos here that both word and deed depend.”\nAlkinoos then responded to him, saying: “Her words\nshall indeed hold good, just as surely as I am alive\nand lord over all the Phaiakians, those lovers of the oar!\nBut let our guest, despite his yearning to get back home,\nbear to stay till tomorrow, until I can render all\nour gift-giving complete. His conveyance shall be the concern\nof all men, but mine above all, since I hold the power here.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Lordly Alkinoos, exalted above all people, should you\nask me to stay on here for a whole year, prior to\norganizing my conveyance, and giving me splendid gifts,\nthat too would I accept: it would profit me far more\nto return with a fuller hand to my own country: then\nI would get a warmer and more respectful welcome\nfrom all men who saw that I’d come home to Ithake.”\nAlkinoos then responded to him, saying: “Odysseus,\non looking at you, indeed we do not suppose\nthat you’re the kind of cheat or trickster that’s bred\nby the black earth in large numbers, itinerant men\nwho fashion false tales from what no man could really see!\nBut you have a way with words and an excellent mind,\nand you told your tale skillfully, just as a minstrel does:\nthe grim troubles of all the Argives, and your own.\nBut come, tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\nDid you see any of those—your godlike comrades—\nwho went out to Ilion with you, and met their end there?\nThe night before us is long, near endless, it’s not yet time\nfor sleep in the hall. Tell me more of your marvelous story!\nI could hold out till bright dawn, if you’d only endure\nto continue the tale of your troubles, here in the hall.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Lord Alkinoos, exalted above all people, there’s\na time for long stories, and a time for sleep. But if\nyou’re still eager to listen, I wouldn’t begrudge you\nthe telling of other matters yet more piteous than these—\nthe troubles of my companions, who perished later,\nafter escaping the Trojans’ grim battle cry: they died\non the way home, through a wicked woman’s will.\n“After holy Persephone scattered the female souls\nof the women hither and thither, in all directions,\nthere came up the ghost of Atreus’ son Agamemnon,\ngrieving; and round him clustered the ghosts of all those\nwho’d died and met their fate with him in Aigisthos’ house.\nHe knew me at once, as soon as he’d drunk the dark blood:\nhe was weeping aloud, and shedding big tears. He stretched\nhis hands out toward me, eager to reach and touch me,\nbut no longer did he have strength or vigor remaining\nin his limbs as once, when they were live and supple.\n“When I saw him I wept, and pitied him in my heart,\nand spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n‘Most renowned son of Atreus, Agamemnon king of men,\nwhat fate of long-grief-giving death was it overcame you?\nWas it Poseidon destroyed you aboard your vessels\nby stirring up the dread blast of hard-blowing gales?\nOr did hostile men work your destruction on dry land\nwhen you were lifting their cattle and fine fleecy sheep\nor fighting them for their city and for their women?’\n“So I spoke; and he at once responded to me, saying:\n‘Scion of Zeus, Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\nneither did Poseidon destroy me aboard my ships\nby stirring up the dread blast of hard-blowing gales,\nnor did hostile men work my destruction on dry land:\nAigisthos it was fixed my death and destiny, slew me—\nhe, with my damnable wife—as a guest in his house\nfor dinner, the way one slaughters an ox at its manger.\nSo I died a most piteous death, and round me all my comrades\nwere killed without mercy, like so many white-tusked hogs\nin the house of a wealthy and highly powerful man\nfor a wedding or communal feast, or some sumptuous banquet.\nBefore now you’ll have witnessed the killing of many men,\nslain in single combat or the violent crush of battle,\nbut this sight would have stirred the most pity in your heart—\nhow all about the mixing bowl and the laden tables\nwe lay in that hall, and the whole floor swam with blood.\nThe most piteous cry I heard was that of Priam’s daughter\nKassandre, murdered by treacherous Klytaimnestra\nas she clung to me. I, fallen, raised my arms in self-defense\nand, dying, flung them about the sword. That bitch\nturned her back, could not be bothered, though I was on\nmy way to Hades, to close my eyes or my gaping mouth.\nThere’s nothing more frightful or shameless than a woman\nwho conceives the idea of such misdeeds in her heart,\nlike the horrifying act that this woman planned, contriving\nher own wedded husband’s murder. I honestly believed\nthat my return home would be welcomed by my children\nand household. But she, mind set upon utter evil,\nhas brought shame both on herself and on women yet unborn—\nthe whole female sex, even those of faultless conduct.’\n“So he spoke, and I then responded to him, saying:\n‘Alas, far-seeing Zeus has nursed a fearsome hatred\nagainst Atreus’ whole line, by means of women’s wiles,\nfrom the start: for Helen’s sake large numbers of us died,\nand Klytaimnestra ensnared you when you were far away.’\n“So I spoke. He at once responded to me, saying:\n‘That’s why you should never go easy, even with your wife!\nDon’t tell her every thought you have in your head:\nTell her some only, keep the rest of them well hidden!\nStill, your own death, Odysseus, will not come from your wife:\nthoroughly sensible, her mind full of virtuous thoughts\nis Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelope, whom we left\nbehind there as a bride, a young wife lately wed,\nwhen we went off to the war: she had a child at the breast,\na baby son, who now must sit numbered among the men\nand is lucky, for his own father will return and see him,\nand the boy will embrace his father, as is right and proper.\nBut that bedfellow of mine did not even let me feast\nmy eyes on my son: before that she’d murdered me.\nAnother thing, too, I’ll tell you, and you lay it to heart:\nIn secret, not openly, hold your vessel on her course\nto your native shore: no more is there faith in women.\nBut come, tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\nHave you heard any news of my son, that he’s still alive\nin Orchomenos maybe, or out at sandy Pylos\nor perhaps with Menelaos in broad Sparta?—for not yet\nhas any place on this earth witnessed noble Orestes’ death.’\n“So he spoke, and I then responded to him, saying:\n‘Son of Atreus, why ask me this? I have no knowledge\nof whether he’s dead or alive. Empty guesses are pointless.’\n“While we two stood together exchanging grim words,\nwith lamentation, and shedding many big tears,\nthere came up the ghost of Peleus’ son Achilles,\nand those of Patroklos, and of peerless Antilochos,\nand Aias, unmatched for handsomeness and stature\namong all the Danaans save for Peleus’ peerless son.\nThe ghost of Aiakos’ swift-footed grandson knew me,\nand sorrowfully addressed me with winged words, saying:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\nrash man, what yet greater deed will your mind think up?\nHow dared you come down to Hades, where reside\nthe mindless dead, the phantoms of outworn mortals?’\n“So he spoke; and I then responded to him, saying:\n‘Achilles, Peleus’ son, most valiant of the Achaians,\nI came out of need for Teiresias, if maybe he could tell me\nsome plan that would get me home to rugged Ithake.\nNot yet have I come near Achaia, not yet have I set foot\non my own land, but have endless trouble. No man, Achilles,\nwas more blest than you in the past, nor shall be hereafter;\nfor while you were living we Argives honored you equally\nwith the gods; and now you’re here you exercise great power\nover the dead. Your death is no cause for grief, Achilles.’\n“So I spoke. He at once responded to me, saying:\n‘Don’t talk up death to me, illustrious Odysseus!\nI’d rather work as a field hand, a hireling, for some other\nlandless man who could just scrape a livelihood together\nthan be lord over all the corpses who’ve ever perished!\nBut come, tell me the news about that fine son of mine—\nhas he gone off to war, and made it as champion, or not?\nAnd have you had any news about Peleus? If so, tell me—\nIs he still honored among the mass of the Myrmidons?\nOr do they show him no honor throughout Hellas and Phthie\nnow that old age has crippled him, hand and foot,\nand I’m no longer there to help him, out in the sunlight,\nor strong, as once I was in the wide terrain of Troy\nwhen I slew the best of their men while defending the Argives?\nIf I could come thus, only briefly, to my father’s house\nthen I’d make my strength and invincible hands most bitter\nto any who show him violence and diminish his honor.’\n“So he spoke, and I then responded to him, saying:\n‘In fact I’ve heard no news regarding flawless Peleus,\nbut about your dear son Neoptolemos I’ll tell you\nthe whole truth, as you requested. I fetched him myself\naboard my trim hollow vessel, brought him out\nfrom Skyros to join the ranks of the well-greaved Achaians.\nAnd when we were planning action around the city of Troy\nhe was always the first to speak, had never a bad idea:\ngodlike Nestor and I alone came up with better ones.\nWhenever we fought with the bronze out on the Trojan plain\nhe’d never hold back among the main body of our troops,\nbut was always far out ahead, unrivaled in prowess,\nand many the men he slaughtered in fearsome battle.\nI couldn’t recount or name all the victims he slew,\nall the many men he dispatched when fighting for the Argives—\nbut one great man, Telephos’ son, he felled with the bronze:\nthe hero Eurypylos, and with him a crowd of his Keteian\ncomrades all perished because of a woman’s gifts.\nNo handsomer man I ever saw, except noble Memnon.\nAnd when we, the best of the Argives, were going into\nthe Horse that Epeios made, all under my command—\nwhen to wait, when we should spring our close-built ambush—\nthen the other Danaan chieftains and counselors\nhad to wipe away tears, the limbs of all were trembling,\nyet him I never once noticed with my own eyes\ndabbing the tears from his cheeks, or his handsome features\nlosing their color; he kept on pleading with me\nto let him out from the Horse, his hand was always\non his sword hilt or bronze-heavy spear, impatient to get at\nthe Trojans. But when we’d sacked the steep citadel of Priam,\nhe boarded his ship with a good prize-share of the booty—\nand all unscathed, neither pierced by the sharp bronze\nnor cut up in close combat, as so often happens\nto men during battle: Ares rages in wild confusion.’\n“So I spoke. The ghost of Aiakos’ swift-footed grandson\nmade off with long strides across the asphodel meadow,\nhappy because I told him his son had distinguished himself.\n“The remaining shades of those who were dead and gone\nstood sadly there, all asking about their own concerns;\nof all of them, only the shade of Aias, Telamon’s son,\nstood apart from the rest, still enraged by the victory\nI’d won over him when we two competed by the ships\nfor Achilles’ arms, a prize set up by his lady mother\nwith the sons of the Trojans and Pallas Athene as judges.\nWould that I’d never won the contest for such a prize,\nsince over so rare a head the earth closed because of it—\nthat of Aias, whose beauty and deeds done outshone those\nof all other Danaans save for Peleus’ peerless son.\nTo him I now spoke with words of conciliation: ‘Aias,\ngreat Telamon’s son, could you not, then, even in death,\nabandon the wrath I roused in you over those fatal\narms, surely used by the gods to grieve the Argives,\nsuch a tower of strength they lost in you! The Achaians\nstill ceaselessly mourn your death, as they do the lost life\nof Achilles, Peleus’ son. Yet no one’s more to blame\nthan Zeus, with that terrible hatred he nursed against\nthe army of Danaan spearmen: this it was that doomed you.\nCome close to me, lord, and listen to what I have to tell you!\nOvermaster your great fury, your arrogant spirit!’\n“So I spoke, but he made me no answer, went after the other\nshades of the dead and departed to Erebos. Nevertheless\nhe might still, despite his wrath, have addressed me, or I him,\nbut the spirit within this breast of mine was still eager\nto see the shades of those others now dead and gone.\n“Thereafter I saw Minos, Zeus’ illustrious son,\nholding a golden scepter, sitting in judgment over\nthe dead, as they, sitting or standing, brought each case\nbefore their lord, in Hades’ wide-gated realm.\n“After him I became aware of gigantic Orion,\nherding and driving across the meadows of asphodel\nthe wild beasts he’d killed himself on the lonely mountains,\nwith a club of bronze in his hands, forever unbroken.\n“Tityos too I saw, Gaia’s illustrious offspring,\nlying on the ground, spread over nine whole acres,\na vulture on either side of him tearing at his liver\nand pecking into his guts; he’d no hands to beat them off\nafter forcing himself on Leto, Zeus’ famed bedfellow,\nin broad-lawned Panopeus, on her way to Pytho.\n“I also saw Tantalos suffering painful torment,\nas he stood in a pool, the water lapping his chin:\nhe was maddened with thirst, yet couldn’t ever reach it,\nfor whenever the old fellow bent down to drink\nthe water was sucked down and vanished, and around\nhis feet the black earth appeared, dried up by some god.\nTrees too, high and leafy, hung top-heavy with fruit—\npears, pomegranates, boughs laden with shining apples,\nsweet figs, a profusion of olives. But every time\nthe old man reached out to grasp them, a gust of wind\nwould whirl them aloft toward the shadowy clouds.\n“I also saw Sisyphos suffering most painful torment,\nas he labored to raise a huge stone with his two bare hands:\nscrambling with hands and feet he’d try to push it\nup to the crest of the hill; but when he was on the point\nof getting it over the top, its weight would defeat him:\nbumpity back to the plain the shameless stone would clatter.\nYet he kept straining and heaving, while the sweat streamed down\nfrom his limbs, and the dust rose swirling around his head.\n“After him I became aware of powerful Herakles,\n[his phantom, for he himself among the immortal gods\ntakes joy in the feast, and has the elegant-ankled Hebe,\nchild of great Zeus and the golden-sandaled Here:]\naround him arose a bird like clamor from the dead\nas they scattered in terror, while he, as dark as night,\nholding a bare bow with an arrow at the string,\nkept glancing sharply round him, as though about to shoot.\nA fearsome thing was the baldric girding his torso,\na belt of gold on which wondrous objects had been fashioned—\nbears and wild boars, and lions with glinting eyes,\nand fights and battles and murder and the slayings of men.\nMay he never have crafted, or again craft, another such,\nthe man who stamped that belt with his special craftsmanship!\nHerakles recognized me the moment he saw me,\nand sorrowfully addressed me with winged words, saying:\n‘Son of Laertes, scion of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,\npoor wretch, are you leading the kind of grim existence\nsuch as I too bore beneath the rays of the sun?\nI was Kronos’ son Zeus’ offspring, and yet I suffered\nwoes beyond measure, for I was placed in subjection\nto a man far worse man than myself, who laid hard labors on me.\nHe even once sent me here to get Hades’ hound: he could think\nof no harder labor for me than this. Yet that hound I did\nindeed carry off and bring up out of Hades—\nI had Hermes and grey-eyed Athene serving as my guides.’\n“So saying, he went on his way, back into Hades’ realm,\nbut I remained firmly there, in case there might come up\nany more of the heroes who’d perished so long ago;\nand I might indeed have seen men of old whom I wanted to—\nTheseus, Peirithoos, famed progeny of the gods—\nbut before that, great swarms of the dead came thronging up\nwith loud eerie cries, and pale terror gripped me, the fear\nthat the head of the Gorgon, that ghastly monster, might\nbe sent against me from Hades by holy Persephone.\n“So at once I went back to the ship, and ordered my comrades\nto embark again themselves, and cast off the stern warps.\nSo they came aboard quickly, and sat down on the benches,\nand the current bore the ship fast down Ocean’s river,\nhelped first by our rowing, and then by a following wind.”\n",

         "\n“After our ship left the course of Ocean’s river and came\nto the swelling waves of the wide-tracked sea, and the isle\nof Aiaia, where is the abode of Dawn, the early riser,\nand her dancing floors, and the risings of Helios the sun,\nthen we beached our vessel, hauled her up on the sands,\nand ourselves disembarked on the seashore. There we fell\nasleep, and stayed thus, awaiting the bright dawn.\n“When Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nI sent my companions off to Kirke’s domain\nto bring back the body of the deceased Elpenor.\nNext we cut wood for his pyre and at the seaward tip\nof the headland held his funeral, mourning and shedding tears.\nThen after his corpse was burned—along with its armor—\nWe heaped up a burial mound, raised a marker on it,\nand on top of the tomb set up his well-shaped oar.\n“So we busied ourselves with these matters, nor was Kirke\nunaware that we’d got back from Hades: very promptly\nshe readied herself, and came out. The handmaids with her\nbrought bread and much meat, and tawny-red wine, and she,\nbright among goddesses, now spoke in the midst of us, saying:\n‘Foolhardy men, who went down to Hades’ realm alive,\nand met death twice, when others die only the once!\nBut come now, you’ve food to eat and wine to drink\nthe whole day through! Then, at the coming of Dawn,\nyou’ll set sail. I’ll show you your route and brief you\non every detail. That way, no ruinous bad decisions,\nat sea or ashore, will leave you in desperate trouble.’\n“So she spoke: the proud spirit in us was persuaded.\nThe whole day long, then, till sunset we sat feasting\non abundant meat and sweet wine; but when the sun\nwent down, and darkness came on, then all the others\nlay down to sleep beside the ship’s stern warps;\nbut me Kirke took by the hand, led apart from my comrades,\nmade me sit down, then questioned me in detail,\nand I told her the whole story, just as it happened.\nThereupon the lady Kirke spoke at length to me, saying:\n‘All that, then, has been accomplished. Now listen to what\nI shall tell you: the god himself will remind you of it.\nFirst off, you’ll come to the Sirens. They bewitch\nand beguile all mortals who come within earshot of them.\nAny man who unwittingly gets close enough to hear\nthe Sirens’ voices will never again be surrounded\nby wife and children greeting him on his return home;\nthe Sirens will enchant him with their clear high singing\nas they sit in a meadow, among great heaps of bones\nfrom men’s rotted bodies, the skin on them all shriveled.\nRow on past them, and stop up the ears of your comrades\nwith beeswax—soften it first—so none of them can hear.\nBut as for yourself, if you’re determined to listen,\nhave them tie you, hand and foot, while upright, against\nyour swift ship’s mast, in its step, with rope ends lashed\nto the mast itself, so you can hear and enjoy the Sirens.\nBut if you beg and command your comrades to release you,\nthey are then to bind you more firmly with yet more bonds!\nThen, when your comrades have rowed you beyond the Sirens,\nfrom that point on, I’ll no longer tell you in full detail\nwhich course is the one to follow, but you yourself\nmust make up your mind. I shall give you two options.\nOn the one side are crags, overhanging, and against them\ncrash the great breakers of dark-eyed Amphitrite:\nthese crags the blessed gods call the Wandering Rocks.\nThat way not even winged creatures go, not even the shy\ndoves that carry ambrosia to Zeus the Father: the smooth-\nworn rock always snatches one at least of these away,\nand the Father sends in another to restore the numbers.\nNo mortal vessel that tried it has ever got past those rocks—\nship’s timbers and human bodies are both together\ncarried off by the waves and gusts of destructive fire—\nsave that one seafaring vessel which alone escaped them:\nArgo, of worldwide fame, sailing home from Aietes—\nand she too would soon have been slammed into those great crags\nhad Here not steered her safe through, out of love for Jason.\n‘Next are the two headlands. One of them towers up\nto broad heaven, with a sharp peak. Dark clouds surround it,\nthat never disperse: its summit never enjoys clear air,\nnot even in spring or autumn. There’s not a man alive\ncould scale that peak or set foot on its crest, not even\nwere he endowed with a score of hands and feet,\nfor the rock is as smooth as though it had been polished.\nHalfway up this headland there’s a murky cavern\nfacing west, toward the dusk and Erebos. It’s that way\nyou should steer your hollow ship, illustrious Odysseus,\nfrom which hollow ship not even the strongest man\ncould shoot an arrow up into that cave’s interior.\nThere, in it, dwells Skylle, yelping most fearsomely;\nHer voice may be only as loud as that of a newborn puppy,\nbut she is an evil monster, the sight of whom would please\nnobody, were it even a god who encountered her.\nA dozen legs she has, all waving in the air,\nand six necks, very lengthy, and on every one of them\na horrible head, with three rows of teeth in each,\nclose-set and crowded, all full of black death. From below\nthe waist her body is hidden inside the hollow cavern,\nbut her heads she stretches out from that fearsome abyss\nand goes fishing there, searches all around the rock face\nfor dolphin or dogfish or whatever larger creature\nshe can catch of the thousands loud Amphitrite breeds.\nPast her no sailors yet can boast of having voyaged\nunharmed, for with each of her heads she carries off\na man that she snatches out of his dark-prowed vessel.\n‘But the other headland, Odysseus, as you’ll see, is lower—\nthe two are close together, within easy bowshot—\nand on it grows a great fig tree with luxuriant foliage.\nBeneath this divine Charybdis sucks in the dark water—\nthrice daily she spews it out upward, thrice sucks it all back\nwith fearsome effect—may you never be there then!\nNot even the Earth-Shaker could save you from destruction.\nRather hold course close to Skylle’s headland and quickly\nsteer your ship past it, since it’s far preferable\nto lose six of your crew than for all of you to perish.’\n“So she spoke, and I then responded to her, saying:\n‘Come, I beg you, goddess. Tell me this truthfully: Is there\nany way I can both get clear of deadly Charybdis\nand stop the other, when she tries to snatch my comrades?’\n“So I spoke, and she, bright among goddesses, snapped back:\n‘Foolhardy man, once again you’re set on deeds of warfare\nand hardship! Will you not yield even to the immortal\ngods? Because she’s not mortal, but an immortal evil,\ndread, disastrous, wild—and not to be fought with,\nfor there’s no defense—best course is to flee from her.\nFor if you linger to arm yourself beside her rock\nI fear she may once again dart out and assault you\nwith as many heads, and seize as many men as before.\nSo row past at speed, while calling upon Krataiis,\nSkylle’s mother, who bore her to be a bane to mortals:\nshe then will stop her from making that second assault.\n‘So you’ll come to the isle of Thrinakie. There at pasture\nare Helios’ numerous cattle and well-fed flocks:\nseven herds of oxen, and as many fine flocks of sheep,\nwith fifty head in each herd. They never bear young,\nnor do they ever grow old. They’re tended by goddesses,\nfair-tressed nymphs, Phaethousa and Lampetie,\nwhom resplendent Neaira bore to Hyperion Helios.\nThese their lady mother, when she’d borne and reared them,\nsent out to the isle of Thrinakie, to a distant life\ntending their father’s flocks and crumple-horned cattle.\nIf you leave these unharmed and take care over your return\nyou may still get home to Ithake, after much suffering;\nbut should you harm them, then I foresee destruction\nfor your ship and your comrades. You yourself may escape,\nthough you’ll get home late, in bad shape, your comrades all lost.’\n“So she spoke, and then, golden-throned, the Dawn came up.\nShe, bright among goddesses, departed up the island,\nwhile I went back to the ship and aroused my comrades\nto embark themselves and to cast off the stern warps;\nthey came aboard quickly and sat down at the benches,\nand in good order struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\nIn the wake of our dark-prowed ship a following breeze\nthat filled our sail, a trusty companion, was sent us\nby fair-tressed Kirke, dread goddess of mortal speech.\nSo when we’d secured the tackle throughout the ship\nwe sat down: wind and steersman now kept her on her course.\n“Then I finally, grieving at heart, addressed my comrades:\n‘Friends, since it’s not right that one or two only should know\nthe gods’ decrees that Kirke, bright among goddesses, told me,\nI shall now relate them to you: it will be in that knowledge\nthat we either die or escape, sidestepping death and fate.\nFirst, the heavenly Sirens. She bids us keep well away\nfrom them, their singing, and their flowery meadow.\nMe alone she wanted to hear them: you are to tie me fast\nwith harsh bonds, keep me upright in place against the mast,\nin its step, with rope ends lashed to the mast itself.\nBut if I beg and command my comrades to release me,\nyou are then to bind me more firmly with yet more bonds.’\n“Thus I was passing on all the details to my comrades,\nand meanwhile our well-built ship very soon arrived\nat the Sirens’ isle, driven on by a following breeze.\nAbruptly the wind now dropped, and was replaced\nby a windless calm. Some god lulled the waves to sleep.\nMy comrades stood up, took down and furled the sail,\nstowed it down in the hollow ship, then sat at the benches\nand whitened the water with their polished pinewood oars.\nNow with the sharp bronze I cut a great wheel of wax\ninto small bits, which I kneaded in my strong hands.\nSoon the wax grew warm under their great pressure\nand the rays of the sun god, Hyperion Helios.\nWith this wax I stopped up the ears of all my comrades,\nand they bound me hand and foot, while standing, to the mast,\nin its step, with rope ends lashed to the mast itself,\nand then sat down, struck the grey salt deep with their oars.\n“But when we were as far off as a man’s shout carries,\nswiftly pursuing our course, the speeding ship did not,\nas it neared, escape notice. The Sirens began their shrill song:\n‘Look in here on your way, famed Odysseus, the Achaians’ pride:\nput in with your ship, hear the song we two sing! Never yet\nhas any man rowed on past us in his black ship till he’s heard\nthe honey-sweet music that issues from our mouths,\nand he voyages on rejoicing, his knowledge increased, for we\nknow all the toil and suffering that in the wide land of Troy\nArgives and Trojans endured through the will of the gods:\nIndeed, we know all things that happen on the nurturing earth.’\n“Such the words they uttered in their beautiful voices. My heart\nyearned to listen. I signaled my comrades to release me—\na nod with my eyebrows. They bent to their oars, rowed on.\nEurylochos and Perimedes both at once stood up,\nbound me with further lashings, made them all tighter.\nBut when they’d rowed past the Sirens, and no longer\nwere their voices or their singing within earshot, then\nmy loyal comrades at once removed the wax with which\nI’d blocked their ears, and released me from my bonds.\n“But after we’d left that island, then very soon I saw\nsmoke, and a heavy surf, and heard a thunderous noise.\nThe rowers were frightened, the oars slipped from their grasp\nand hung clattering in the riptide; the ship came to a halt\nnow they were no longer plying their shapely oar blades.\nBut I went through the ship encouraging my comrades\nwith kindly words, approaching each man in turn: ‘My friends,\nwe’ve not hitherto gone short on experience of trouble!\nThis danger we face now is no greater than when the Kyklops\nby brute force and strength shut us up in his hollow cave—\neven then, my courage, invention, and presence of mind\nfreed us: this peril too, I think, we’ll live to recall!\nSo now, please all do exactly as I command: you must\nstay seated there at the rowlocks and with your oars\nstrike the deep surf of the sea, so that maybe Zeus\nwill grant that we escape, steer clear of this evil fate.\nAnd to you, steersman, I give this command: store it well\nin your memory—you control the hollow ship’s helm!\nKeep the ship well away from all this smoke and surf:\nstay close to the headland, don’t let her veer unnoticed\nacross to the other side, or you’ll destroy us all.’\n“So I spoke, and they promptly obeyed the commands I gave them.\nBut not yet did I mention Skylle, that irremovable danger,\nfor fear lest my comrades, terrified, might abandon\ntheir rowing, and cower together down in the hold.\nIt was now I forgot Kirke’s troublesome instruction\nthat for no purpose whatsoever should I now arm myself.\nI put on my battle gear, I picked out two long spears,\nand carrying them made my way to the vessel’s foredeck,\nfrom where, I figured, this rock-based Skylle would first\nbe glimpsed as she brought disaster to my comrades.\nBut nowhere could I discern her, and my eyes grew weary\nfrom searching every part of the murky rock face.\n“So on through the narrow strait, lamenting, we sailed—and there\non one side was Skylle, on the other bright Charybdis\nfearsomely sucking in the salt seawater: when she\nspewed it back out, like a cauldron over a blazing fire,\nshe was all seething turbulence, and the flying spray\nwas flung up so high that it rained down on the tops\nof both headlands; when she sucked the salt seawater back,\nshe exposed her wild inner turmoil, while all around\nthe rock roared: beneath it the bottom was revealed,\nblack with sand. Pale fear now possessed my men,\nwe gazed at Charybdis in terror, fearing destruction.\nSkylle meanwhile snatched up from the hollow ship\nsix of my comrades, the strongest and most active.\nThough my eyes were on the swift ship and my company,\nI still caught a glimpse of their hands and feet above me\nas they were whirled aloft. They cried out aloud,\ncalled me by name one last time in their anguish. As when\na fisherman with his long rod on a jutting rock\nthrows down bits of bait as a lure when fish are scarce,\nand lets down into the deep the horn of a country ox,\nthen grabs the hooked gasping victim, flings it ashore—\nso they were carried up, gasping, toward the rocks.\nThere at her entrance she devoured them, as they screamed\nand stretched out hands to me in their dire death struggle.\nThat was the most piteous sight of all that ever I endured\nthroughout my whole exploration of the paths of the deep.\n“Then when we’d escaped the rocks and fearsome Charybdis\nand Skylle, soon after that we arrived at the god’s\nmatchless island, where were the splendid broad-browed cattle\nand numerous well-fed flocks of Hyperion Helios.\nWhile still out at sea in my black ship, I could hear\nthe lowing of cattle on the way back to their farmstead\nand the bleating of sheep; and into my mind now stole\nthe words of the blind seer, of Theban Teiresias,\nand of Aiaian Kirke, who most strongly advised me\nto avoid the island of Helios, bright delight of mortals;\nand then, grieved at heart, I spoke out among my comrades:\n‘Distressed though you are, my comrades, mark my words well\nwhile I tell you of the prophetic warning Teiresias uttered,\nhe and Aiaian Kirke: they most strongly advised me\nto avoid the island of Helios, bright delight of mortals,\nfor there, she told me, was our most dreadful danger.\nSo, row our black ship straight on past this island.’\n“So I spoke,\nand the spirit within them was broken. But at once\nEurylochos responded to me in chilling language:\n‘You’re a hard man, Odysseus, with rare strength: your limbs\nnever tire, every last bit of you is fashioned of iron:\nyou won’t let your comrades, worn out by sleeplessness\nand toil, disembark, when we might indeed once more\non this sea-girt isle find the stuff for a tasty supper! But no,\nyou’re making us wander on through the speeding night,\nsteering away from this island over the murky deep!\nIt’s night that breeds dangerous winds, the wreckers of ships—\nhow indeed could we escape from utter destruction\nshould some sudden tearing gale bear down upon us\nfrom the south or the storm-ridden west wind, which most often\nbreak up ships in despite of the gods, their sovereign lords?\nNo, let us now rather yield to black night, put in,\nstay close by the black ship to prepare our supper, and then\nin the morning embark, sail out over the broad sea.’\n“So Eurylochos spoke: the rest of my comrades applauded.\nI saw now what kind of trouble some god had in store for us,\nand so I spoke and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n‘Eurylochos, you force my hand: I’m one man only. But listen:\nI want all of you here present to swear me a mighty oath,\nthat if we come on a herd of cattle, or a great flock\nof sheep, no man will succumb to maleficent recklessness\nand slaughter either a steer or a sheep. Rather show restraint\nand eat the food that immortal Kirke provided for us.’\n“So I spoke. They at once swore not to, as I requested,\nand when they had sworn and completed the oath, then we\nmoored our well-built ship inside the hollow harbor\nnear a freshwater spring, and my comrades disembarked\nfrom the ship and expertly then set about preparing supper.\nBut when they’d put from them the desire for food and drink,\nthen they began to weep, recalling their dear shipmates\nwhom Skylle had snatched from the hollow ship and devoured,\nand sweet sleep came upon them while they were weeping.\nBut in the night’s third watch, when the stars were setting,\nZeus the cloud-gatherer raised a blustering wind against us\nwith a tremendous tempest, sent storm clouds that hid\nboth land and sea: from heaven there sprang forth night.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nwe dragged our ship to a roomy cave and made her fast there,\nwhere the nymphs had their fine dance floors, held their meetings.\nThen I called an assembly and addressed my comrades, saying:\n‘Friends, in our swift ship there is both food and drink:\nso let’s keep our hands off the cattle, lest we come to harm,\nfor these cows and well-fed sheep belong to a dread god,\nHelios, who both sees and hears everything.\n“So I spoke:\nand their proud hearts were persuaded. But after that\nfor an entire month nonstop the south wind blew,\nand no other wind arose, apart from the east and south.\nNow so long as the men still were getting food and red wine\nthey kept their hands off the cattle, being anxious to stay alive;\nbut when the provisions in the ship were all exhausted,\nand they were driven by need to go in search of game—\nfish or fowl, whatever might come to hand,\nangling with bent hooks, for hunger wore down their bellies—\nthen I went off up the island, to pray to the gods:\none of them possibly might show me the road to take.\nSo when going through the island I’d left my comrades,\nI found shelter from the wind and washed my hands,\nand prayed to all the gods that possess Olympos. But what\nthey did was to shed sweet sleep upon my eyelids,\nwhile Eurylochos was giving bad advice to my comrades:\n‘Distressed though you are, my comrades, mark my words well:\nAll kinds of death are loathsome to wretched mortals,\nbut to die of starvation—that’s the most pitiful of fates!\nCome, let’s rather drive off the best of Helios’ cattle,\nand sacrifice to the immortals who hold wide heaven!\nAnd if ever we get to Ithake, our native country,\nwe’ll at once build a lavish temple to Hyperion Helios,\nand fill it with plenty of high-class dedications!\nAnd if he’s angry with us because of his straight-horned cattle,\nand wants to destroy our ship, and the other gods agree,\nI’d rather gulp down seawater and get it over\nthan starve to death slowly here on this desolate island.’\n“So Eurylochos spoke, and my other comrades assented.\nAt once they drove off the best cattle of Helios,\nfrom nearby, since it wasn’t far from our dark-prowed vessel\nthat his fine cows, broad of brow and crumple-horned,\nwere grazing. Around these they stood and prayed to the gods,\nwith the fresh leaves they’d plucked from a tall oak’s foliage,\nsince they had no white barley aboard the well-benched ship.\nWhen they’d prayed and slit the cows’ throats and flayed them,\nthey cut out the thighs, wrapped them up in a double layer\nof fat, and placed above them cuts of raw meat. They had\nno wine left that they could pour over the blazing sacrifice,\nso they made libations with water, roasted the innards.\nBut when the thighs had been burnt and they’d tasted the entrails,\nthen they chopped up the rest and threaded it on spits.\nIt was now that sweet sleep retreated from my eyelids,\nand I set off back to our swift ship and the seashore.\nBut when, as I went, I came close to our shapely vessel,\nthe sweet aroma of roast meat filled the air around me,\nand I groaned and cried out aloud to the immortal gods:\n‘Zeus, Father, and you other blessed gods that are forever,\nit was indeed to my ruin that you lulled me with pitiless sleep\nwhile the comrades I’d left behind committed this monstrous act!’\n“At once to Hyperion Helios long-robed Lampetie\ncame with the news that we had slaughtered his cattle.\nAngered at heart, he at once spoke up among the immortals:\n‘Zeus, Father, and you other blessed gods that are forever,\ntake revenge on the crew of Odysseus, Laertes’ son,\nwho have wantonly slaughtered the cattle in which I took\nsuch pleasure each time I ascended the starry heaven\nand when I turned back down again from heaven to earth.\nIf they don’t compensate me fittingly for my cattle,\nI shall go down to Hades and spread light among the dead.’\n“Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer responded to him, saying:\n‘Helios, please go on shining among the immortals\nand on mortal mankind upon the grain-giving earth!\nThese men’s swift ship I’ll soon hit with a bright thunderbolt\nin the midst of the wine-dark deep and shatter to fragments.’\n“This exchange I learned about later from fair-haired Kalypso,\nwho said she herself had heard it from Hermes the Guide.\n“But when I came back down to the ship and the sea,\nI rebuked all my men, confronting each one of them in turn;\nbut we found no solution. The cows were already dead.\nNow too for my men the gods made a show of portents:\nthe hides crawled, the meat, both raw and roasted, mooed\non the spits, there was a sound like that of lowing cattle.\n“For six days now my oh-so-trusty comrades dined\non Helios’ best cattle that they’d driven off; but when\nZeus son of Kronos brought the seventh day upon us,\nthen the wind stopped blowing at gale force, and we promptly\nboarded our ship and set forth into the wide sea, after\nfirst stepping the mast and hoisting the white sail on it.\nBut once we’d left the island behind, and there was no other\nland above our horizon, nothing but sky and sea,\nthen the son of Kronos conjured up a black cloud\nover our hollow ship, and the deep beneath it darkened.\nShe ran on for no long time, since suddenly there came\na screaming west wind, a tempest blowing at full gale force.\nThe blast of that wind snapped the forestays holding the mast,\nboth of them—back fell the mast, and all its tackle\ndropped pell-mell into the bilge; at the stern of the vessel\nthe mast struck the steersman’s head, crushing all\nthe bones of his skull together. He like a diver fell\nfrom the deck, and clear of the bones his proud spirit fled.\nZeus with a clap of thunder hurled his bolt at our vessel:\nshe shuddered her whole length, struck by the bolt of Zeus,\nand was filled with the reek of sulfur. The crew all fell overboard,\nand like shearwaters went bobbing around our black ship\nborne up by the waves. The god deprived them of their return.\nBut I kept my foothold aboard until the surge tore sides\nfrom keel. The stripped keel the waves now bore off, broke\nthe mast loose at keel level. Attached to the mast\nwas a backstay fashioned of oxhide. This I seized,\nand lashed the two together, the keel and the mast.\nRiding on these, I let the fierce winds sweep me away.\n“But then the tempestuous gale-force west wind ceased,\nand at once instead came the south wind, cause for alarm,\nsince it would carry me back to murderous Charybdis.\nAll night long it so bore me, until at sunrise I came\nto the headland of Skylle and to dread Charybdis, who now\nsucked in the salt seawater; but I reached up\nas high as I could, caught hold of the tall fig tree,\nand clung to it like a bat. Yet I could in no way manage\nto get firm foothold or to climb up on it, since\nits roots were far distant, its branches high, out of reach,\nlong, massive, overshadowing Charybdis. So there\nI clung on persistently, waiting for her to spew back\nthe mast and keel again. To my delight, back they came,\nthough late—at the hour a man leaves assembly for supper,\none who judges the many disputes of quarrelsome young men,\nthen it was that those timbers resurfaced out of Charybdis.\nI let go my handhold and foothold, went plunging down,\nhit the water ahead of the lengthy spars, and sitting\nastride them steered my way onward with both hands.\nBut Skylle the Father of gods and men did not permit\nto see me again, or I’d not have avoided sheer destruction.\n“Nine days I was carried from there, and on the tenth night\nI was brought by the gods to the isle of Ogygia, where\nfair-haired Kalypso dwells, dread goddess of human speech,\nwho befriended and cared for me. But why tell you this story?\nI’ve told it already, just yesterday, here in your house\nto you and your comely wife. I really dislike repeating\na tale that’s been clearly narrated on a previous occasion.”\n",

         "\nSo he spoke: every one of them sat hushed and silent,\nenthralled by his words, throughout the shadowy hall.\nThen Alkinoos once again responded to him, saying:\n“Odysseus, now you’ve come to my brazen-floored home\nwith its high roof, I don’t think you’ll be driven back here again\non your homeward journey, despite all your misadventures!\nThis I say along with a charge on each man here present—\nall you who in my halls daily drink up the elders’\ntawny-red wine, and sit on here, listening to the singer.\nClothes are laid by for the stranger in a polished chest,\nand finely wrought gold, together with all those other gifts\nthat the counselors of the Phaiakians brought here. But come,\nlet’s each one of us now present him with a great tripod\nand cauldron: we’ll recoup the cost by a public collection—\nit’s hard for one man to spend that much without repayment.”\nSo spoke Alkinoos: what he said was pleasing to them.\nThey now retired to rest, each man to his own house.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthey went down to the ship with the bronze in which men delight.\nAlkinoos, princely in power, himself ranged through the ship,\nstowing gifts under the benches, to ensure they would not\nget in the way of the rowers when they bent to their oars.\nThen they went to Alkinoos’ house and had their dinner.\nAlkinoos, princely in power, sacrificed an ox for them\nto Zeus of the dark clouds, son of Kronos, lord over all.\nAfter burning the thighs, they sat down to the splendid feast\nwith great enjoyment. Among them a divine bard performed—\nDemodokos, highly honored by the people. But Odysseus\nkept turning his head toward the bright-shining sun,\nimpatient for it to start setting: he wanted to be gone.\nAs a man longs for supper, one with whose jointed plow\ntwo wine-dark oxen have all day furrowed the field,\nand gladly for him does the light of the sun go down\nthat lets him, weary-kneed, head home for supper—\nso welcome to Odysseus was the arrival of sunset.\nThen at once he addressed the Phaiakians, lovers of the oar,\nto Alkinoos above all declaring his mind, in these words:\n“Alkinoos, lord, most distinguished among all peoples,\npour libations, give me safe escort—and farewell to you all!\nEach thing that my heart desired has already been arranged:\nconveyance, and gifts of friendship—may the heavenly deities\nmake these turn out well for me! When I get home\nmay I find my wife truly faithful, my friends all safe and sound!\nAnd may you who remain here give delight to your wedded\nwives and children, may the gods grant you excellence\nof every sort, may no ills ever come among your people.”\nSo he spoke. They all approved, and endorsed the order\nto give the stranger conveyance, since he’d spoken becomingly.\nThen mighty Alkinoos made a request to his herald, saying:\n“Pontonoos, mix us a bowl of wine and serve it to all\nin the hall here, so we may pray to Zeus, the Father,\nand then give this stranger conveyance to his own country.”\nSo he spoke. Pontonoos mixed the mind-honeying wine\nand served it to all in turn. They poured libations,\nfrom where they sat, to the blessed gods who hold\nbroad heaven. Then noble Odysseus stood up,\nand placed the two-handled cup in Arete’s hands,\nand addressed her with winged words, saying: “O queen,\nmay you fare well, now and forever, until old age\nand death, all mortals’ common lot, come on you!\nI’m on my way now, and I wish you all joy in this house\nof your children and people, and of Alkinoos the king.”\nSo spoke noble Odysseus, and stepped out across\nthe threshold, and mighty Alkinoos sent the herald with him\nas his escort, down to the swift ship and the sea,\nwhile Arete sent serving women to accompany him,\none bearing a fresh-washed mantle and tunic, another\nwith orders to carry the close-packed chest, while a third\nbrought the food and the red wine. When they arrived\ndown by the ship and the sea, then quickly the noble\nescorts took over these things and stowed them away\nin the hold of the vessel, all the food and drink.\nFor Odysseus they laid out a linen sheet and a blanket\non the hollow ship’s deck astern to let him sleep soundly.\nHe now went aboard himself and lay down, not speaking.\nThe crew, each in his place, seated themselves at the rowlocks,\nand cast off the hawser from the hole in the stone post.\nThey bent to their task then, flung up the brine with their oar blades,\nand sweet sleep dropped on Odysseus, shuttered his eyelids,\nsweet, deep, and sound, most closely akin to death.\nThe ship—like four yoked stallions on the plain\nthat all spring forward together under the whip’s strokes,\nand swiftly, high-stepping, gallop upon their way—\nlikewise lifted her stern: in her wake there surged a wave,\nvast, dark-hued, of the roaring, many-voiced sea.\nSafe and steady she ran—not even a falcon, the hawk\nthat’s swiftest of all winged creatures, could fly faster,\nso quickly she sheared her way through the waves of the sea,\nbearing a man whose foresight matched that of the gods,\nwho in the past had suffered many sorrows at heart\nboth in men’s wars and while braving the cruel sea,\nbut now slept undisturbed, his sufferings all forgotten.\nAt the time of that brightest star’s rising, which most clearly\ncomes to herald the light of Dawn, early risen, then it was\nthat the seafaring vessel approached the island. There is\na certain harbor of Phorkys, that Old Man of the Sea,\nin the land of Ithake, with two protruding headlands,\neach broken off short, and each crouched facing the harbor,\nwhich they shield from those heavy waves whipped up outside\nby powerful gales, while the well-benched ships lie within\nunmoored, once they reach their position for anchorage.\nAt the head of the harbor there grows a long-leafed olive tree,\nand close to this is a cave, very pleasant and well-shaded,\nthe sacred terrain of those nymphs who are known as Naiads.\nInside it are mixing bowls and two-handled stone jars,\nand there too is where the bees deposit their honey.\nIn the cave there are long stone looms, at which the nymphs\nweave their webs of sea-purple, a wonder to behold.\nSprings, ever-flowing, are there, and the cave has two entrances,\none facing the north wind, accessible to mortals,\nbut the other, looking southward, is sacred, and men\ndo not use it: it is a pathway for the immortals only.\nHere they put in—they knew the place well—and the ship\nran half her whole length up the beach, so great was the speed\nat which she was driven on by the arms of the rowers.\nThen, stepping ashore from the well-benched ship, they first\nlifted Odysseus out of the hollow ship, together\nwith the linen sheet and bright blanket, laid him down,\njust as he was, on the sand, still fast asleep, and unloaded\nthe goods that the noble Phaiakians had given him, through\ngreat-hearted Athene’s prompting, as he set out homeward.\nThese things they left all together by the trunk of the olive tree,\naway from the path, for fear some other traveler might\ncome upon them and filch them before Odysseus woke up.\nThen they took off back home. However, the Earth-Shaker\ndid not forget the threats he’d made earlier against\ngodlike Odysseus, and now he questioned Zeus’ purpose:\n“Zeus, Father, no longer among the immortal gods\nshall I be honored, when some mortals respect me not at all—\nthe Phaiakians, even though they share my own ancestry!\nFor lately I said that Odysseus would have a heap of trouble\nbefore he got home—though I did not wholly deprive him\nof his return: you’d promised that, sworn with your nod!\nYet those men bore him sleeping in their swift ship over the deep,\nset him down on Ithake, gave him countless gifts—\nbronze, and plentiful gold, and woven garments,\nmore than Odysseus could ever have won from Troy\nhad he come home unscathed, with his fair share of the spoils.”\nThen Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, responded to him, saying:\n“Well, wide-powered Earth-Shaker, what a speech that was!\nThe gods do you no dishonor! A harsh business it would be\nto assail with demeaning slights our oldest and noblest!\nBut if any mortal, misled by his own forceful power, fails\nto honor you, you can always be revenged on him hereafter.\nDo as you wish, whatever gives your heart pleasure.”\nThen Poseidon, Earth-Shaker, responded to him, saying:\n“I’d act at once, dark-clouded one, in the way you describe,\nbut I always dread your wrath, and avoid it. Still, now I’d like,\nas that so-beautiful vessel of the Phaiakians comes\nback from its voyage as escort on the misty deep,\nto smash it, make them desist, give up this conveyancing\nof people! And hide their city with a great encircling mountain.\nThen Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, responded to him, saying:\n“My brother, this, to my mind, seems your best way to act:\nWhen all the folk from the city are watching that ship\nas she puts in, then turn her to stone, very close to land,\na stone like the swift ship, so that all mankind may marvel.\nBut don’t hide their city with a great encircling mountain.”\nNow when he heard this, Poseidon, the Earth-Shaker,\nwent off to Scheria, where the Phaiakians dwell,\nand waited there, until that seafaring ship came close\ninshore, moving fast. Then the Earth-Shaker approached.\nHe turned her to stone, and rooted her deep below\nwith one blow from the flat of his hand. Then he was gone.\nThey exchanged winged words then, one to another, did\nthe long-oared Phaiakians, men renowned for their ships,\nand thus would one who’d seen it speak to his neighbor:\n“Ah me, who was it that fettered our swift ship in the sea\non her homeward voyage, when she was in plain sight?”\nSo would one speak. How it happened they had no idea.\nBut Alkinoos made them a speech on the subject, saying:\n“Well now, I do recall certain ancient predictions made\nby my father: he used to say that Poseidon was angry\nwith us, because we give safe convoy to all and sundry.\nOne day, he said, a most beautiful Phaiakian vessel\nreturning from escort duty out on the misty deep\nhe’d strike, and hide our city with a great mountain round it.\nSo said the old man, and now this is being fulfilled!\nSo come, let us all agree to do as I bid: we must cease\nto provide conveyance for mortals, whenever a traveler\nvisits our city; moreover, we must sacrifice to Poseidon\na dozen choice bulls, that he may have compassion for us\nand not hide our city with a great encircling mountain.”\nSo he spoke. They were terrified, got the bulls ready,\nand were all of them busy praying to the lord Poseidon,\nall those leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians,\nstanding around the altar, when noble Odysseus awoke\nfrom sleep in his native land, yet failed to recognize it,\nso long had he been away; for about him the goddess Pallas\nAthene, Zeus’ daughter, had shed a mist, to make him\nunrecognizable when she told him what was going on,\nand so that neither his wife nor the townsfolk nor his friends\nwould know him until the suitors had paid the full price\nfor their wrongdoing. Thus everything he saw seemed strange\nto their ruler—the unbroken paths, the bays with safe anchorage,\nthe steep rocky cliffs, the flourishing trees. So up he got,\nand stood there, gazing round at his own native land.\nAfter a moment he groaned, and struck both thighs\nwith the flat of his hands, and sorrowfully exclaimed:\n“Alas, to what mortals’ country have I come this time?\nAre they wild and savage, devoid of notions of justice,\nor hospitable to strangers, men with god-fearing minds?\nWhere am I supposed to be taking all this wealth? Where indeed\nam I wandering to myself? I should have stayed put there with\nthe Phaiakians! Then I’d have met some other mighty king\nwho’d have befriended me, helped me with my homecoming!\nNow I’ve no idea where to store this stuff— I can’t leave it here,\nlest it might become, to my cost, the spoil of others.\nNot quite so intelligent or right-thinking, then, I reckon,\nwere those leaders and counselors of the Phaiakians who\ndumped me in some strange country, when indeed they’d said\nthey would bring me to sunny Ithake. They failed to do so.\nMay Zeus, the protector of suppliants, requite them,\nhe who watches over mankind, who punishes each wrongdoer!\nSo I’ll count up the items here, examine them well, and see\nif they took anything with them in their hollow ship when they left.”\nThat said, he set about counting the surpassingly fine tripods\nand cauldrons, the gold, the exquisite woven garments.\nOf these he found nothing missing. But he mourned for his own land\nas he slouched along its shore by the noisy, many-voiced sea,\nwith much lamentation. Athene now approached him,\nin the likeness of a young man, a herder of sheep,\none delicately nurtured, as are the sons of princes:\nround her shoulders she wore, double-folded, a well-made wrap,\non her sleek feet she had sandals, in her hands a hunting spear.\nOdysseus saw her, rejoiced, went up and confronted her,\nand addressed her with winged words, saying: “Good friend,\nsince you’re the first person I’ve encountered in this country,\ngreetings, and may it be with no evil intent you meet me!\nNo, rather rescue these presents, and rescue me, for to you\nI pray now as to a god, I come suppliant to your knees.\nAnd tell me this truthfully, so that I can be certain of it:\nWhat land, what region is this? What people dwell here?\nIs it one of the sunny islands, or some promontory, sloping\ndown to the salty deep from the rich-soiled mainland?”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“You’re an ignoramus, stranger, or you must come from far away\nto be asking about this country. It’s very far from being\nas nameless as all that! Indeed, many people know it,\nboth those who dwell nearer to the dawn and the sun,\nand those further behind, out toward the murky darkness.\nIt’s rough terrain, not fit for the driving of horses,\nYet not wholly worthless, even if lacking broad plains.\nGrain grows there abundantly, wine too is a product,\nthere’s always rain and dew to keep it fertile, it’s good\npasture for goats and cattle, there’s also fine ground cover\nof every sort, together with all-year watering-places.\nThus, stranger, the name of Ithake has spread even to Troy,\nwhich, they say, is far distant from the country of Achaia.”\nSo she spoke. Noble much-enduring Odysseus was glad,\ntaking joy in the land of his fathers as he heard the words\nof Pallas Athene, the daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus;\nand he spoke, addressed her with winged words, yet did not\ntell her the truth, held back his actual story,\nmaking up as he went a plausible tale in his mind:\n“I did hear tell of Ithake, even when in broad Krete,\nfar away over the deep, and now I myself have come here\nbringing these goods of mine. I left as much more with my sons,\nand I’m on the run, after killing a son of Idomeneus—\nswift-footed Orsilochos, who in broad Krete surpassed\nfor fleetness of foot all bread-earning men—because\nhe meant to deprive me of the plunder I’d won from Troy,\n(to get which I’d suffered much agony, battling through\nboth the wars of men and the high seas), because I’d refused\nto do his father a favor by serving as his henchman\nin the land of Troy, while commanding other troops of my own.\nSo I ran him through with my bronze-tipped spear as he came\nback from the fields. I lay in wait for him at the roadside\nwith one companion. A dark night obscured the sky:\nnobody saw us. Unperceived, I robbed him of life.\nBut when I’d dispatched him with the sharp bronze, I went\nat once to the lordly Phoenicians’ ship, besought them—\ngiving them plunder enough to satisfy their desire—\nto take me on board as a passenger, land me at Pylos,\nor noble Elis, where the Epeians hold power.\nBut gale-force winds forced them away from there, though much\nagainst their will: they had no plan to deceive me.\nSo, beaten off course by weather, we arrived here at night,\nand quickly rowed into the harbor, nor did any among us\nthink at all about supper, though we needed it badly,\nbut just as we were, after landing, we all lay down, and sweet\nsleep descended upon me in my exhaustion. But they\nremoved all my goods from the hollow ship, and put them\nclose to where I was lying, there on the sand, and then\nthemselves went aboard and departed for populous Sidon,\nwhile I was left behind here, grieving at heart.”\nSo he spoke.\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, smiled and stroked him\nwith one hand, and changed her appearance into the likeness\nof a tall and beautiful woman, one skilled in fine handiwork,\nand spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Sharp\nand guileful he’d need to be, the man who’d outsmart you\nin every trick, were it even a god who met you! Perverse,\ndevious-minded, obsessed with deceit, won’t you ever,\neven in your own country, abandon your deceptions\nand the lying tales you adore from the very ground up? But let’s\nspeak no more of these things—we’re experts both\nin craftiness: you are the best of all living mortals\nfor counsel and storytelling, while I among all the gods\nam famed for contrivance and sharpness. You failed to recognize\nZeus’ daughter Pallas Athene—I who always stand\nat your side, I who guard you in all your tough endeavors—\nand made sure that you were befriended by all the Phaiakians!\nNow I have come once more to weave a new plan with you,\nto hide all these treasures which the lordly Phaiakians\ngave you for your homecoming—by my plan and urging!—\nand to tell you all the troubles it’s your destiny to endure\nin your well-built home. And endure them you must, not reveal\nto anyone, man or woman, that in fact it’s you,\ncome back from your wanderings, but silently endure\na host of indignities, submit to men’s violent acts.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“It’s hard for a mortal, goddess, to recognize you on meeting,\nhowever clever he is: you can assume any likeness!\nBut this I know well, you were kindly disposed toward me\nback when we sons of Achaians were fighting at Troy.\nBut after we’d sacked the steep citadel of Priam,\nand left in our ships, and some god then scattered the Achaians,\nnever since then, Zeus’ daughter, have I seen you, or observed\nyou boarding my ship, to ward off some trouble from me!\nIt was indeed burdened with a torn heart in my breast\nthat I kept wandering on, until the gods rescued me\nfrom my troubles—until, indeed, in the Phaiakians’ rich land\nyou cheered me with your words, yourself led me to their city!\nNow in your father’s name I entreat you—for I don’t\nthink it’s to sunny Ithake I’ve come, but some other\ncountry I find myself in, and that this assertion of yours\nwas spoken in mockery, to deceive my mind—please tell me\nwhether in fact or not it’s my native land I’ve come to.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“You always have some such idea in your head! That’s why\nI cannot abandon you in your unhappiness. Besides,\nyou’re courteous, sharp-witted, discreet. Any other man\nwould gladly, on getting back after his wanderings,\nhave hurried home to see his wife and children; but you\naren’t willing to ascertain anything or to make enquiries\nuntil you’ve made trial of your wife, who, now as always,\nsits in your halls, while for her the long nights and days\nwaste away slowly in sorrow with the tears she sheds.\nBut this I never doubted, and in my heart knew well—\nthat you’d make it home after losing all your comrades.\nStill, I wasn’t ready to quarrel on your behalf with Poseidon,\nmy father’s brother, who nursed a grudge in his heart\nagainst you, enraged because you blinded his dear son.\nBut come now, I’ll show you the realm of Ithake, convince you!\nThis is the harbor of Phorkys, the Old Man of the Sea,\nand here, at the head of the harbor, is the long-leafed olive tree,\nand close to it the cave, very pleasant and well-shaded,\nthe sacred terrain of those nymphs who are known as Naiads.\nThis is the high-roofed cave where you used to honor\nthose nymphs with so many rich sacrifices; and yonder\nforest-clad mountain is Neriton.”\nThat said, the goddess\ndispersed the mist, and the landscape stood out clearly.\nThen glad indeed was long-suffering noble Odysseus,\nand rejoiced in his country, and kissed the grain-giving earth,\nand at once, raising up his hands, made a prayer to the nymphs:\n“You Naiad nymphs, Zeus’ daughters, never once did I\nthink that I’d see you again! But now with friendly prayers\nI greet you—and gifts I shall give you, as I used to do,\nshould Zeus’ daughter, leader of hosts, be willing to let me\nlive on myself, and to bring my own dear son to manhood.”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene responded to him, saying:\n“Be confident, don’t let these matters bother your mind! And now\nlet’s store your goods right away in the furthest recess\nof the sacred cave, where they’ll always be safe for you,\nand ourselves plan how all may turn out for the best.”\nSo saying,\nthe goddess made her way into the shadowy cave,\nsearching through it for hiding places, while Odysseus\nbrought all his treasures inside—the gold, the unworn bronze,\nand the finely made clothing that the Phaiakians gave him.\nThese things he stowed well away, and Pallas Athene,\ndaughter of Zeus of the aegis, set a stone at the entrance.\nThen they both sat down by the trunk of the sacred olive,\nand discussed how to wreak destruction on the arrogant suitors.\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, began the discussion, saying:\n“Scion of Zeus, Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\ntake thought how to lay hands on these shameless suitors\nwho for three years now have been lording it in your halls—\ncourting your godlike wife, pressing wooers’ gifts upon her,\nwhile she, heart yearning sadly for your return, gives hope\nto all, making promises to every last man of them,\nand sending them messages. But her mind is on other things.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“Indeed, I was like to have met the same evil fate\nin my halls as did Agamemnon, son of Atreus,\nhad you not told me, goddess, the whole truth of the matter!\nSo come now, weave me a scheme of revenge upon these men,\nand yourself stand by my side, fill me with strength\nand daring, as when we undid the bright diadem of Troy!\nWere you, grey-eyed goddess, beside me, hot to fight,\nI’d take on, with you, three hundred warriors, O my\nsovereign goddess, given your free and ready support.”\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Assuredly I shall stand by you: you will not go unnoticed\nwhen we are about this business: your broad floor, I think,\nwill be splashed with the blood and brains of more than one\nof those suitors who are now devouring your livelihood!\nFirst, let me make you unrecognizable to any mortal:\nI’ll shrivel the healthy flesh on your supple limbs,\ndestroy the fair hair on your head, wrap you in rags so foul\nas to make the mere sight of a man who’s clad in them disgusting;\nand I’ll dim your eyes, that before were so attractive,\nto make you look really shabby to all these suitors—\nand to your wife, and the son you left behind in your halls.\nNow what you must do first of all is seek out the swineherd—\nhe looks after your pigs, but also is well disposed toward you,\nand loves your son, and discreet Penelope. Him you’ll find\nstationed along with his pigs. These are out at pasture\nclose to the Raven’s Rock and the spring of Arethousa,\nfeeding on plentiful acorns and drinking dark spring water,\nthose things that nourish the abundant fat of swine.\nStay there, and sitting by him, ask all your questions.\nI meanwhile shall go to Sparta, land of fair women,\nand summon Telemachos—your dear son, Odysseus—\nwho went to broad Lakedaimon to visit Menelaos\nand enquire about you, find out if you were still alive.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“Why didn’t you tell him, you whose mind is all-knowing?\nWas it so he too might suffer hardships traversing\nthe unharvested sea, while others devour his livelihood?”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Don’t let him be too heavy a weight upon your mind!\nIt was I who directed him, so he’d get a good reputation\nby going there! He’s suffered no hardship, he’s relaxing\nin the house of Atreus’ son, enjoys his limitless bounty.\nThere are young men lying in wait for him in their black ship,\neager to kill him before he gets back to his native land;\nbut I don’t see it happening. Before that the earth will cover\none or more of the suitors now devouring your livelihood.”\nSo saying, Athene began touching him with her wand.\nShe shriveled the healthy flesh on his supple limbs,\ndestroyed the fair hair on his head, and over his whole\nperson now stretched the skin of an old and age-worn man.\nShe dimmed his eyes, that before were so attractive,\nand changed his clothes to a ragged cloak and tunic,\nall threadbare and filthy, begrimed with foul black smoke;\nand round him she cast the great hide of a speedy deer,\nbald of its hair, and gave him a staff, and a leather bag\ntattered and rent, that was held by a twisted cord.\nPlans made, the two of them parted. The goddess now left\nfor lordly Lakedaimon, in search of Odysseus’ son.\n",

         "\nBut the rough path up from the harbor was that which Odysseus\nnow took, by the woodland and heights, to where Athene\nsaid he’d find the noble swineherd, who, of all the household\nOdysseus possessed, devoted most care to his property.\nEnsconced in his forecourt he found him, where the enclosure\nhad been built up high, at a point with a wide view round,\na fine big open courtyard, in a sheltered position. This\nthe swineherd had built himself, unknown to his mistress\nor old Laertes, for the pigs of his absent master, using\nquarried stones, topped off with a coping of prickly thorn.\nOutside he’d driven in posts, right round in a circle,\nstrong and close, splitting them off from an oak’s dark center;\ninside the enclosure he’d fashioned a dozen sties\nset close to each other, to serve as beds for the pigs:\nin each of them fifty ground-sleeping swine were penned.\nThese were sows, for breeding; the boars bedded down outside,\nand were fewer by far in number, for the godlike suitors\nmade inroads on them for feasting. The swineherd always\nsent them the best of the fattened hogs: there were\nthree hundred and sixty of these, and there slept beside them\nfour guard dogs, as savage as wild beasts, specially reared\nby the swineherd, leader of men. He himself was now busy\nmaking a pair of sandals and fitting them to his feet,\ncutting a piece of fresh-colored oxhide. The others\nhad gone off, one here, one there, with their droves of swine—\nthree of them, that is: the fourth he’d sent into town\nwith a hog, taken under constraint, to the arrogant suitors,\nfor them to slaughter and glut their appetites with the meat.\nOdysseus was suddenly spotted by the ferocious guard dogs,\nand they made for him, barking loudly. Odysseus, however,\nshowing presence of mind, sat down, letting go of his staff.\nYet there on his own farmstead he might have been badly hurt\nhad the swineherd not run up quickly, chasing the dogs\nacross the forecourt, dropping his oxhide as he came,\nand, shouting loudly, had scattered them this way and that\nwith volleys of stones. He then addressed his master, saying:\n“Old man, those dogs came so close to tearing you apart\nin an instant, and you would have put the blame on me!\nAnd the gods have brought on me other griefs and sorrows:\nFor I sit here lamenting, and mourning a godlike master\nand fattening up these hogs for other men to devour,\nwhile he may now be adrift, half-starved and in need of food,\nin some town or country of aliens, foreign of speech—\nthat is, if he’s still alive, and enjoying the sunlight!\nBut come indoors with me now, old man, and after\nyou’ve quietened your heart with food and wine, you too\ncan relate where you’re from, all the hardships you’ve endured.”\nSo saying, the noble swineherd escorted him to his hut,\nushered him in, heaped up thick rough brushwood, and on it\nspread the hide of a shaggy wild goat for him to sit on—\nhis own coverlet, large and hairy—and Odysseus was pleased\nat being given such a good welcome, and addressed him, saying:\n“My host, may Zeus and the other immortal gods now grant you\nwhat you most desire, since you gave me a ready welcome.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, did you make answer, saying:\n“Stranger, were one even meaner than you to come here,\nI’d still have no right to reject him, for all strangers and beggars\nare from Zeus, and a gift, however small, is friendly\nfrom folk such as us; for that’s always the lot of servants,\nfrightened when those who have the mastery over them\nare the young. The gods, it’s true, have blocked that man’s return\nwho’d have treated me as a friend, would have given me possessions—\na home, a plot of land, a much-courted wife, such things\nas a kind-hearted master gives to a servant of his\nwho works hard for him, whose labor a god makes prosper\njust as this work prospers to which I’m now committed.\nFor me my lord would have done much, had he grown old here;\nbut he perished, as I now wish Helen’s whole line had perished,\nutterly, she who unstrung the knees of so many men!\nFor he too went out there to save Agamemnon’s honor,\nto Ilion, rich in good horses, to fight against the Trojans.”\nSo saying, he quickly girded his tunic with a belt,\nand went out to the sties, where the droves of pigs were confined.\nFrom there he chose two, brought them in, and killed them both,\nsinged them and cut them up and put the meat on spits,\nand roasted it. Then he placed the cuts, hot and still spitted,\nwith a sprinkling of white barley, in front of Odysseus.\nIn an ivy-wood bowl he now mixed the honey-sweet wine,\nand sat down facing his guest, and addressed him invitingly:\n“Eat now, stranger! Enjoy the food that’s the fare for servants—\ncheap pork! The fattened hogs are kept for the suitors’ meals,\nmen whose minds care nothing for the gods’ wrath, or for pity.\nThe blessed gods do not favor reckless deeds, but rather\nhave rewards for justice and for men’s righteous deeds.\nEven the hostile and lawless, who invade the land of others\nto get a living, and Zeus allows them their plunder, so that\nthey sail home with laden vessels—on their minds too\nfalls the strong fear of the gods’ wrath. But these men here\nmust know something, must have had some word from a god\nabout his sorry death, since they will not court properly\nor go back to their own possessions, but here at their ease\nwaste our goods wantonly, and restraint there is none,\nfor on every night and day that we get from Zeus they never\nsacrifice just one victim, or even two, I think,\nand our wine they waste, consuming it recklessly.\nGreat indeed, past telling, were his resources: no other\nheroic warrior, either away on the dark mainland,\nor on Ithake itself, could match them. Not twenty men\ntogether had as much wealth: I’ll list you the sum of it.\nOn the mainland, twelve herds of cattle, twelve flocks of sheep,\nas many droves of swine and wide-ranging troops of goats\nare pastured alike by outsiders and his own herdsmen.\nEleven wide-ranging troops of goats browse at the farthest\nend of the island, and over them good men watch,\neach of whom daily drives off one of his troop for them—\nwhichever fattened goat looks to be the best that he has.\nMyself, I guard and watch over these swine here, and choose\nthe best of the hogs to provide for them.”\nSo he spoke.\nHis grateful guest was already downing the meat and wine\ngreedily, in silence, planning trouble for the suitors.\nBut when he’d had supper, and quietened his heart by eating,\nthe swineherd topped up with wine the bowl from which\nhe himself drank, and gave it him; he took it, glad at heart,\nand spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying: “Friend,\nwho was the man that bought you with his resources,\none as wealthy and powerful as you mentioned? You say\nhe perished upholding the honor of Agamemnon: tell me,\nsince such a person I may perhaps recognize;\nfor only Zeus and the other immortal gods may know\nwhether I’ve seen and had news of him: much I’ve wandered.”\nThe swineherd, leader of men, responded to him, saying:\n“Old man, no wanderer who turned up with news of him\nwould ever convince his wife and son: far from it!\nVagrant fellows in need of comfort and sustenance\ntell lies: they have no desire to offer a true account!\nAnyone who in his wandering stops off at Ithake\ngoes straight to my mistress and spins her a lying yarn;\nand she entertains him kindly and questions him in detail,\nwhile shedding tears of sorrow from beneath her eyelids,\nas a woman will do when her husband has perished far away.\nYou too, old man, would be quick to concoct a story\nIf someone gave you for it a cloak and tunic to wear!\nAs for him, by now the dogs and swift birds of prey\nwill have torn the skin from his bones, and the soul’s gone from him,\nor fish in the deep sea have eaten him, and his bones\nare now down under the sands of some mainland beach.\nSo he’s perished out there, and on his friends hereafter—\nall, but on me most of all—grief’s been laid, for never again\nwill I find so kindly a master, however far I go,\nnot even if I went back to my parents’ home, the place\nwhere I was born, and they raised me themselves. Yet it’s not\nso much for them that I grieve—much though I now long\nto set eyes on them again, to be in my own country—\nno, it’s Odysseus for whom I yearn, and he’s gone!\nTo speak his name, stranger, even when he’s absent, I find\npresumptuous, since he always loved and cared for me greatly:\n‘Honored master’ I rather call him, even though he’s far away.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, since yours is a total denial, since you don’t believe\nthat man will ever come back, and your heart’s still incredulous,\nthen I’ll not just make a plain statement, but swear an oath to it\nthat Odysseus will return! I claim the reward for good news\nthe moment that man sets foot inside his home—then clothe me\nin a cloak and a tunic, fine garments! But until then,\nhowever sore my need, I would not accept anything;\nfor as hateful to me as the gates of Hades is the man\nwho, yielding to poverty, concocts a deceitful story.\nZeus, first among gods, be my witness, and this guest’s table,\nand the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\nthat all these things indeed will come to pass as I tell you!\nWithin the current moon’s sequence Odysseus will arrive here,\nbetween this month’s waning and the rising of the next.\nHe will come back home, and take vengeance on all those\nhere who dishonor his wife and his illustrious son.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Neither shall I pay you this reward for good news, old man,\nnor will Odysseus ever come home, so relax and drink,\nand let’s think about other matters—don’t remind me of these!\nThe heart in my breast suffers agonies whenever\nanyone mentions my caring master. As for your oath,\nwe’ll let that ride: may Odysseus indeed come back,\nas I hope and desire, as indeed does Penelope too,\nand aged Laertes, and godlike Telemachos. Now\nit’s for him I ceaselessly grieve, the son Odysseus begot:\nTelemachos. Him the gods bred up like a sapling: I thought\nhe’d grow to be no worse a man among men\nthan his own dear father, a marvel in form and looks.\nBut some immortal damaged the common sense within him,\nor maybe some human: he went after news of his father\nto sacred Pylos, and now the lordly suitors are lying\nin wait for him on his way home, that Arkeisios’ godlike\nline may die out on Ithake, leave no name behind.\nBut we’ll leave him be now, whether he’s to be ambushed\nor escape with a helping hand from the son of Kronos.\nCome now, old sir, inform me about your own misfortunes,\nand make it a truthful account, one that I can rely on!\nWho are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\nWhat kind of ship did you come on? And how did sailors\nbring you here to Ithake? And who did they claim to be?\nFor I don’t imagine you made your way here on foot.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Very well, I’ll give you a truthful account of these matters.\nI only wish that we two had enough supplies of food\nand sweet wine, here in your hut, enough to last a while,\nthat we could feast on in silence, while others did the work:\neasily then could I take up the space of a whole year\nand still not have finished the tale of my heartfelt sufferings—\nsum total of all that by the gods’ will I’ve endured.\n“From broad Krete, I claim, derives my family background:\nI’m the son of a wealthy man, and numerous other\noffspring were born and raised in his halls, legitimate\nsons of his wife; but the mother who bore me was bought,\na concubine. Yet he honored me like his true-born sons,\ndid Kastor, the son of Hylax, from whom I claim descent,\nand who was revered like a god by the Kretans in their land\nfor his wealth and prosperity, his splendid sons. But still\nthe spirits of death pounced on him and carried him off\nto the house of Hades. His property was divided\nby his arrogant sons, who cast lots for it. But to me\nthey allotted a small portion only, house and all.\nYet I married a wife from a wealthy landowning family\non the grounds of my excellence: I was no good-for-nothing,\nno coward in battle. Now all that strength is gone,\nthough I think when you look at the stubble you’ll recognize\nwhat the grain once was. Since then I’ve suffered greatly.\nIn the past Athene and Ares endowed me with courage\nand rank-breaking strength: whenever I chose for an ambush\nour best men, sowing the seeds of trouble for the foe,\nnever did my proud spirit anticipate death: no, I\nwas always the first to spring forward, and with my spear\nto lay low any opponent who lacked my speed of foot.\nSuch a man was I in warfare. Field work was not to my taste,\nnor was running a household—the way to raise fine children.\nOared vessels were always my passion—that, and warfare,\narrows and well-polished javelins—deadly objects,\nto which others, more often than not, react with a shudder;\nbut to me were welcome: maybe a god endeared them to me,\nand different men take pleasure in different actions.\nFor before the Achaians’ sons set foot in the land of Troy\nI had nine times commanded troops and swift-sailing ships\nagainst foreign fighters. Much plunder kept coming my way,\nof which I chose what I fancied, and plenty afterwards\nI obtained by lot. At once my house grew rich: thenceforward\nI became respected and feared among the Kretans.\n“But when\nfar-seeing Zeus devised that hateful expedition\nwhich unstrung the knees of so many warriors, then\nthey ordered me, together with far-famed Idomeneus,\nto lead ships to Ilion, nor was there any device\nthat would let us refuse, for the people’s stern will compelled us.\nThere for nine years we Achaians’ sons were at war,\nbut on the tenth we sacked Priam’s citadel, and set out\nfor home in our ships. A god then scattered the Achaians,\nand for wretched me Zeus the planner thought up more trouble.\nOne month I stayed home, taking pleasure in my children\nand wedded wife and possessions. But after that\nto Egypt my spirit drove me to make a voyage,\nin ships that were well appointed, with my godlike comrades.\nNine ships I fitted out, and their crews assembled quickly.\nFor six days on end my trusty comrades feasted,\nand I provided them with victims in plenty, so they\ncould sacrifice to the gods and have a feast themselves;\nthen on the seventh we boarded, sailed out from broad Krete,\nrunning on before a strong wind out of the north,\nlightly, as though downstream: nor did any misfortune\nbefall my vessels: unscathed and free from sickness\nwe sat there, while the wind and the helmsmen steered them.\n“On the fifth day we reached Egypt’s fine-flowing stream\nand in that Egyptian river I anchored my curved vessels.\nThen I issued orders to my trusty comrades, to remain\nthere with the ships, and to be those ships’ protectors\nwhile I sent off scouts to find and man lookout posts.\nBut, trusting their strength, they yielded to wanton aggression,\nand at once began ravaging the Egyptians’ splendid\nfields, and carrying off their wives and little children,\nand killing the men. Word quickly reached the city,\nand, hearing the shouting, people came out at daybreak.\nThe whole plain filled up with infantry and horses\nand the bright glint of bronze. Zeus, hurler of thunderbolts,\ncast a craven panic upon my comrades: nobody dared\nto stand firm and face the foe, for trouble confronted us\non every side. Many of us they slew with the sharp bronze;\nothers they led off alive, to do forced labor for them.\nBut Zeus himself put this thought in my mind—how I wished\nI had suffered death and encountered my destiny there\nIn Egypt, since yet more sorrow was waiting to welcome me!\nAt once I removed from my head the well-wrought helmet,\nand the shield from my shoulders, and let fall my spear,\nand made my way toward the horses of the king,\nand clasped his knees and kissed them. He rescued and pitied me,\npicked me up in his chariot, took me, weeping, to his home.\nNumerous fighters ran at me with their ash-wood spears,\neager to kill me, for they were greatly angered;\nbut he warded them off, in concern for the wrath of Zeus,\nthe strangers’ protector, the stern requiter of evil deeds.\n“I stayed there for seven years, during which I acquired\ngreat wealth from the men of Egypt, for they all gave me gifts.\nBut when the eighth year came round for me, there appeared\na man, a Phoenician, a fine expert in deceptions,\na sharp nibbler, who already had cheated many people.\nBy his cunning he talked me into accompanying him\nto Phoenicia, where were located his home and his possessions,\nand there I stayed with him till a year had run its course.\nBut when at length the months and days were completed\nOf the circling year, and the seasons in turn came on,\nhe put me aboard a seagoing ship bound for Libya,\nwith a lying tale that we’d both be conveying a cargo,\nbut in fact to sell me there for a high price. I went with him\non the ship, though suspecting trouble, under constraint.\nShe ran on before a strong wind out of the north,\nabove central Krete; but Zeus was planning their destruction,\nand when we’d left Krete behind us, and there was no other\nland in plain view, but nothing save sky and sea,\nthen the son of Kronos conjured up a black cloud\nover our hollow ship, and the deep beneath it darkened.\nZeus with a clap of thunder hurled his bolt at our vessel:\nshe shuddered her whole length, struck by the bolt of Zeus,\nand was filled with the reek of sulfur. The crew all fell overboard,\nand like shearwaters went bobbing around our black ship,\nborne up by the waves. The god deprived them of their return.\nBut for me, in my heartfelt distress, Zeus himself at this moment\nput into my hands the sea-going vessel’s great mast,\nso that once more I might escape destruction. And so,\nclinging firmly to this, I was carried away by fierce winds\nfor nine days, but on the tenth, in the blackness of night,\na great wave rolled me ashore in Thesprotian country.\nThere the Thesprotian king, the hero Pheidon,\ncared for me without payment, for his son now found me\novercome by chill air and exhaustion, and took me home,\nleading me by the hand, till he reached his father’s abode,\nand gave me clothing, a mantle and tunic. It was there\nthat I heard news of Odysseus, for the king now told me\nhe’d befriended and entertained him on his way to his native land,\nand showed me all the possessions Odysseus had amassed—\nbronze and gold, and iron, laboriously wrought,\nenough to support his descendants to the tenth generation,\nso great was the wealth stored for him there in the king’s domain.\nBut Odysseus, he said, had gone to Dodone, to discover,\nfrom the deep-leaved sacred oak, what Zeus was planning,\nand how he should make his way back to Ithake’s rich land\nafter so long an absence, whether openly or in secret.\nAnd he swore to me at home, while pouring libations,\nthat the ship had been launched, and the crew were in readiness\nto convey him to his own country. But me he sent off first,\nsince there chanced to be a Thesprotian vessel ready\nto set sail for Doulichion, that country rich in wheat.\nHe told them to ferry me there, to King Akastos, with proper\ncare; but an evil plan had found favor in their hearts\nabout me, so I’d still suffer at misery’s nadir. When\nthe seagoing vessel had sailed a fair way from land, at once\nthey set about making ready the day of slavery for me.\nMy clothing, my mantle and tunic, they stripped off from me,\nand replaced them with the vile rags and tattered tunic\nthat you can see now in front of you. That same evening\nthey reached the tilled fields of sunny Ithake. Then\nthey left me bound fast in the well-benched ship with a rope\nthat they’d twisted tight, and themselves went off ashore,\nand hastened to take their supper there on the seashore.\nBut the gods themselves took care of me, untied the knots\neasily. Wrapping the rags around my head, I slid down\nthe polished gangplank, plunged breast first into the sea,\nstruck out with both arms, swimming fast, and very quickly\ngot back ashore, well away from where they were.\nThen I went up and found a coppice in full bloom,\nand lay cowering there, while they, complaining loudly,\nwent searching around; but when it seemed quite hopeless\nto go on looking, they went back and reembarked\non their hollow ship. The gods themselves kept me hidden\neasily, then brought me safe here to the farmstead\nof an understanding man. So, it’s still my fate to live.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Ah, wretched stranger, indeed you stirred my heart deeply\nwith your detailed tale of how much you suffered and wandered!\nBut one part was not, I think, right, nor will you convince me—\nwhat you said of Odysseus. Why should a man such as you\ntell a pointless lie? Apropos my lord’s homecoming,\nthis I know well: he got himself so hated by all the gods\nthat they would not allow his life to end among the Trojans\nor in the arms of his friends, after winding up the war.\nThen all the Achaians would have raised him a burial mound,\nand great glory would have been his, and his son’s, hereafter.\nBut now, ingloriously, the storm winds have swept him away.\nI stay out here with the pigs, I don’t go into town,\nexcept those times when prudent Penelope wants me,\nwhen news has reached her from somewhere or other—then\nfolk sit round and keep querying every detail,\nboth those who grieve for their lord who’s been so long gone,\nand those who enjoy eating up his livelihood for free.\nBut I haven’t fancied this business of questioning and enquiries\never since a certain Aitolian deceived me with his story.\nHe was someone who’d killed a man: after wandering far\nhe appeared at my house, and I gave him a friendly welcome.\nHe’d seen him, he said, with the Kretans in Idomeneus’ company,\nrepairing his ships, severely battered by storms. He assured me\nOdysseus would be back here by summer or harvesttime,\nbringing much treasure, both he and his godlike comrades!\nAnd you, grief-struck old man, since some god led you to me,\ndon’t try to please me with lies, or to charm me in any way:\nThat’s not why I shall respect and befriend you, but through fear\nof Zeus, god of strangers, and because I feel pity for you.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“The spirit you have in your breast is indeed distrustful,\none not to be won or persuaded even by my sworn oath!\nCome, then, let’s make an agreement, to which hereafter\nthe gods who hold Olympos can bear witness for us both:\nIf your master does in fact return to this house of his,\nthen give me a mantle and tunic to wear, and send me\non to Doulichion, which is where my heart’s set on going;\nbut if your master does not come back home—as I tell you\nhe will—set your servants on me, have me thrown off a high cliff,\nas a warning to other beggars against telling lying tales.”\nThen the noble swineherd responded to him, saying:\n“Stranger, that way I’d win a fine reputation for virtue\namong men, both today and in time to come, were I,\nwho brought you into my hut and entertained you,\nthen to kill you, deprive you of the dear breath of life!\nVery ready I’d be then to pray to Kronos’ son Zeus!\nBut now it’s time for supper. My comrades should very soon\nbe home, so we can make a tasty meal in the hut.”\nWhile the two thus conversed, the one with the other, the pigs\nand the men who were herding them now drew near. The sows\nthey shut up for the night in their accustomed sties,\nand a vast clamor arose from the pigs as they were penned.\nThen the noble swineherd called to his comrades, saying:\n‘‘Fetch out the best of the hogs, so I can slaughter it\nfor the stranger—he’s traveled far—and we’ll share it too,\nwho have all the trouble of tending these white-tusked swine\nwhile others devour our labor and pay nothing for it.”\nSo saying, he split up wood with the pitiless bronze,\nwhile the others brought in a five-year-old fattened hog\nand set him down by the hearth. Nor did the swineherd\nforget the immortals now, for his was a virtuous mind.\nHe cut off and cast in the fire as firstlings hairs from the head\nof the white-tusked hog, with prayers to all the gods\nthat quick-witted Odysseus might return to his own home.\nThen he lifted a billet of oak he’d kept from the splitting\nand felled the hog. It died. They cut its throat and singed it,\nthen butchered it at once. The swineherd took cuts of raw flesh\nfrom all its limbs as firstlings, wrapped them in rich fat,\ngave them a sprinkling of barley, then threw them in the fire.\nThe rest they cut up, and threaded the pieces on spits,\nand roasted them carefully, then drew all the pieces off\nand heaped them on platters. The swineherd now\nstood up to carve, an expert in fair sharing. The meat\nhe sliced into seven portions: one he set aside\nfor the nymphs and for Hermes, son of Maia, together\nwith an accompanying prayer. Of the rest, each man got one.\nBut Odysseus he honored with the long cuts from the chine\nof the white-tusked hog, and gladdened his master’s heart.\nResourceful Odysseus now addressed him, saying: “Eumaios,\nI only wish you could be as dear to Zeus the Father\nas to me, a poor man, whom you honor with such good things.”\nTo him, then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Eat, my strange guest, and enjoy what’s offered here,\nsuch as it is. A god will give one thing, but let another go,\njust as the whim takes him. He can do anything .”\nSo he spoke, and offered the firstlings to the gods that are forever,\npoured bright wine in libation, then put the cup in the hands\nof Odysseus, sacker of cities, and sat down by his portion.\nBread was served to them by Mesaulios, whom the swineherd\nhad acquired by himself, during his master’s absence,\nunknown to his mistress and to the aged Laertes,\npurchasing him from the Taphians with his own resources.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nMesaulios took off the bread, and they hastened to retire,\nfilled to repletion with all the bread and meat they’d eaten.\nNow night came on—bad weather, the dark of the moon. Zeus rained\nthe whole night through. A strong wet west wind kept blowing.\nThen Odysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd:\nwould he strip off his own cloak and give it him, or tell\none of his comrades to do so, since he cared for him so much?\n‘‘Hear me out now, Eumaios, and you, all his other comrades,\nwhile I tell you a boastful story. It’s the wine that’s urging me—\nmind-crazing stuff, that sets on even the quick-witted\nto singing and gentle laughter, drives him to get up and dance,\nor to make some remark better left unspoken. However,\nnow that I’ve opened up, I won’t keep quiet about it.\nI wish I was young again and my strength still undiminished,\nlike the time we prepared an ambush, and led it beneath Troy’s walls.\nThe leaders were Odysseus and Atreus’ son Menelaos,\nand I was the third in command, at their own invitation.\nWhen we came up under the city and its sheer wall,\naround the outskirts, in the thick brushwood, among\nthe reeds and marshes, crouching down under our arms\nwe lay. A bad night came on when the north wind dropped.\nIt grew chilly. Snow descended on us like hoar frost,\nfreezing cold. Ice crystals formed upon our shields.\nNow all the rest were equipped with cloaks and tunics\nand slept in peace, their shields pulled over their shoulders,\nbut when I set out I’d left my cloak behind with my comrades—\nthoughtlessly, not supposing I’d ever get so cold,\nso I’d come with only my shield and my shining waist-guard.\nBut in the third watch of the night, when the stars had turned,\nthen I spoke to Odysseus, who was lying close beside me,\nnudging him with my elbow. He gave ear at once.\n‘Scion of Zeus, Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\nI shan’t be among the living much longer, this wintry cold\nis killing me, I’ve no cloak, some god beguiled me\ninto wearing a tunic only: there’s no way out for me now.’\n“So I spoke, and he then thought up the following scheme—\nsuch a man he was both for planning and for fighting!—\nand speaking in a low voice he addressed me, saying:\n‘Quiet now, in case some other Achaian might overhear you.’\nWith that, head propped on his bent arm, he made a speech:\n‘Listen, friends: a god-sent dream came to me while I slept.\nWe’ve come too far from the ships. Is there someone who’d go\nand ask Atreus’ son Agamemnon, his people’s shepherd,\ncould he send us more of the troops from beside the ships?’\n“So he spoke, and there stood up Thoas, Andraimon’s son,\nwith alacrity, laid aside his purple cloak, and set off,\nrunning, back to the ships. I lay down in his clothing\ngladly. Then Dawn, golden-throned, appeared. Would that\nI were young now, as then I was, my strength still unimpaired—\nthen would one of the hands in the farmstead lend me a cloak,\nboth from kindness and out of respect for a decent man.\nBut as it is they despise me for the rags I’m wearing.”\nTo him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“Old man, this tale you recounted was faultless: in it\nnothing you said was unfitting or profitless. Hence\nyou’ll not go short of clothing nor of anything else\nthat befits a long-suffering suppliant on arrival—\nfor now: but at first light you’ll go back to your rags,\nsince here there aren’t many cloaks or changes of tunic\nto put on: no more than one for each man. But when\nOdysseus’ dear son returns, you can look to him\nfor clothing to wear, a cloak and a tunic too,\nand he’ll send you wherever your heart and mind desire.”\nSo saying, up he got, and made up close to the fire\na bed, throwing on it the skins of sheep and goats,\nand Odysseus lay down there, and over him he spread\na big thick cloak he kept by him to change into\nwhenever a really bad winter storm arose.\nSo there Odysseus slept, and alongside him slept too\nthe four young men. But the swineherd himself was not\ncontent to bed down there, to sleep away from the hogs,\nand made ready to go outside. Odysseus was glad\nthat he took such care of his absent lord’s property.\nFirst he slung a sharp sword from his sturdy shoulders,\nthen donned a very thick cloak to keep the wind out,\nand over this draped the fleece of a well-fed goat,\nand took a sharp hunting-spear as defense against dogs or men,\nand went out to get some rest where the white-tusked hogs\nslept, under a hollow rock, out of reach of the north wind.\n",

         "\nNow Pallas Athene was gone to spacious Lakedaimon,\nto remind Odysseus’ great-hearted, illustrious son\nabout his return journey, to speed up his homecoming.\nShe found Telemachos and Nestor’s splendid son\nbedded down in the forecourt of glorious Menelaos.\nNow Nestor’s son was still overmastered by gentle sleep,\nbut sweet sleep had not taken Telemachos: worry about his father\nhad kept him wakeful throughout the ambrosial night.\nNow grey-eyed Athene approached and addressed him, saying:\n“It’s not a good thing, Telemachos, this straying far from home,\nneglecting your possessions, the overweening men\ninfesting your house, the risk they may share and consume\nall your goods, while you’re gone on this useless journey!\nYou must urge Menelaos, good at the war cry, at once\nto send you back, if you want to find your blameless mother\nat home still: already her father and brothers are at her\nto marry Eurymachos—as a gift giver he outdoes\nall the other suitors, is ratcheting up the bride-price!\nAnd make sure she takes no item from the house without your consent—\nfor you know the kind of thinking that lurks in a woman’s breast:\nshe wants to increase the estate of the man who marries her,\nbut of former children and previous wedded spouse\nshe takes no thought once he’s dead, no longer asks after him.\nNo, you must go yourself, and entrust all your property\nto whichever one of your maidservants seems most reliable\nuntil the gods name to you your own noble bride-to-be.\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nThe best of the suitors are lying in wait for you, with intent,\nin the strait between Ithake and rugged Same, determined\nto kill you before you get back to your native land.\nBut I don’t see it happening. Before that, the earth will cover\nsome one of the suitors now devouring your livelihood.\nStill, keep your well-built ship far distant from the islands,\nand sail by night: you’ll get a good tailwind from that\none immortal it is who guards and protects you. But when\nyou make landfall at the nearest shore of Ithake then,\nsend on the ship with all your comrades to the city;\nyou yourself, though, must first seek out the swineherd—\nhe looks after your pigs, and also is well disposed\ntoward you. Spend the night there, and tell him to go into town\nwith a message for prudent Penelope: that you’re unharmed,\nand that you’ve made it back home successfully from Pylos.”\nThis said, she went on her way to lofty Olympos.\nTelemachos then awoke Nestor’s son from his sweet sleep\nwith a kick of the foot, saying: “Rise and shine now,\nPeisistratos, Nestor’s son! Bring out your whole-hooved horses,\nharness them up to the chariot! We need to get going.”\nPeisistratos, son of Nestor, responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, however much we want to be on the road\nno way can we drive through the dark night! It’ll soon be dawn.\nSo wait until Menelaos—Atreus’ hero son, famed spearman—\nbrings out his gifts and stows them aboard the chariot,\nand sends us on our way with affectionate good wishes;\nfor a guest remembers with gratitude all his days\nthe man who was his host, who showed him kindness.”\nSo he spoke, and promptly golden-throned Dawn arrived.\nMenelaos, good at the war cry, came out to them then,\ngetting up from the bed that he shared with fair-tressed Helen,\nand when Odysseus’ son, the hero, caught sight of him, he\nhurriedly clothed himself in his shining tunic, and flung\na great cloak over his sturdy shoulders, and went out\nand approached Menelaos and stood before him and said:\n[did Telemachos, the dear son of godlike Odysseus, saying:]\n“Atreus’ son Menelaos, Zeus’ scion, leader of hosts,\nsend me back right away to my own dear country,\nfor already my heart is impatient for the homeward journey.”\nMenelaos, good at the war cry, then responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, I’ll not press you to stay here overlong\nwhen you want to go home: indeed, I’d blame any other man\nwho, as host, behaved in an overfriendly manner\nas I would the downright unfriendly! Moderation in all things\nis best. It’s just as wrong to urge a guest’s departure\nagainst his will as to keep him when he’s itching to be off.\nTreat your guest well while he’s there, let him go when he wants.\nJust wait, though, until I bring your presents, and stow them—\nfine ones—aboard your chariot, for you to see, while I tell\nthe women to get dinner ready from the rich store within.\nFor there’s prestige and glory as well as profit when those\noff to travel this boundless earth eat a square meal first.\nAnd if you’d like a detour through Hellas and mid-Argos,\nI’d be happy to come along with you, I’ll harness up horses\nand be your guide round the cities—no one will pass us on\nempty-handed, they’ll give us something to take with us,\na fine bronze tripod, perhaps, or maybe a cauldron,\nor a team of two mules, or a golden drinking cup.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Atreus’ son Menelaos, Zeus’ scion, leader of hosts,\nI want to go back to our place now: when I came here I left\nno one to act as guardian over my possessions.\nIn seeking my godlike father I fear I may perish myself,\nor some article of great value go missing from my halls.”\nWhen he heard this, at once Menelaos, good at the war cry,\ngave instructions both to his wife and to her handmaids\nto make ready a meal in the hall from the rich store within.\nEteoneus son of Boethoos, now approached him,\nhaving just got up—he lived very close nearby—\nand him Menelaos, good at the war cry, asked\nto light a fire, and to roast some meat: he heard and did not\ndisobey. Menelaos now went to his fragrant storeroom,\nnot alone, but together with Helen and Megapenthes.\nWhen they came to where their valuables were stored\nthe son of Atreus chose a two-handled cup, and told\nhis son Megapenthes to carry a mixing bowl, made of silver,\nwhile Helen went and stood by the clothing-chests, where lay\nthe embroidered robes that she herself had fashioned.\nOne of these Helen, bright among women, chose\nand lifted out—the largest, the most exquisitely embroidered,\nthat shone like a star and lay underneath all the rest.\nThey went on out from the house till they met Telemachos,\nAnd fair-haired Menelaos then addressed him, saying:\n“Telemachos, may the return that your heart so much desires\nbe brought to pass by Zeus, Here’s loud-thundering spouse!\nAnd of all the gifts that are stored away in my house\nI’ll give you the one that’s most beautiful and most precious—\na finely wrought mixing bowl, one fashioned all of silver\nexcept for its rim, that’s finished off in gold,\nthe work of Hephaistos, a gift from the hero Phaidimos,\nthe Sidonians’ king, at the time that his house gave me shelter\non my way home by that route. Now I’d like to give it to you.”\nSo saying, Atreus’ son, the hero, placed in his hands\nthe two-handled cup, and strong Megapenthes brought\nthe shining mixing bowl, all silver, set it before him;\nwhile fair-cheeked Helen came up to him, carrying\nthe robe in her hands, and now addressed him, saying:\n“I too, dear child, now give you this gift, a memento\nfrom Helen’s hands, for your bride to wear at your longed-for\nwedding. Till then, keep it stored in your halls, looked after\nby your dear mother. And may you enjoy a safe return\nto your well-built home and to your own dear country.”\nThat said, she put it into his hands. He received it with pleasure.\nThe hero Peisistratos now took all the gifts and stowed them\nin the luggage box, gazing at them in wondering admiration.\nFair-headed Menelaos now led them into the house\nand had them all sit down upon chairs and benches,\nand a servant brought hand-washing water in a beautiful\ngolden ewer and poured it over a silver basin so\nthey could wash, and drew up a polished table for them.\nThe respected housekeeper brought in bread and served it\nalong with many side dishes, giving freely of what there was,\nwhile, nearby, Boethoos’ son carved helpings of meat,\nand the son of renowned Menelaos poured out the wine.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nThen Telemachos and the splendid son of Nestor\nharnessed the horses and boarded the fine-wrought chariot\nand drove out from the forecourt and the echoing colonnade.\nWith them went Atreus’ son, the fair-haired Menelaos,\nhis right hand holding enough mind-honeying wine\nin a golden cup, so they might, on leaving, pour libations.\nNow he stood in front of the chariot, and pledged them, saying:\n“Farewell, young men—and to Nestor, shepherd of the people,\ntake my greetings: to me he was like a kindly father\nwhen we sons of Achaians were warring in the country of Troy.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“All this indeed, Zeus’ nursling, exactly as you say,\nwe’ll recount to him on arrival. I only wish that as surely,\nwhen I return to Ithake, I’d find Odysseus at home,\nand be able to tell him all the kindness I’d had from you\nbefore coming, all the fine presents that I was bringing home.”\nJust as he finished speaking, a bird flew in on the right,\nan eagle, grasping a great white goose in its talons,\na tame bird out of the yard, and a crowd of men and women\nran behind, shouting. The eagle swooped toward them\nfrom the right, in front of the horses. They rejoiced at the sight,\nand the spirits of all were comforted in their hearts.\nPeisistratos, Nestor’s son, was the first to speak. He said:\n“Consider now, Zeus’ nursling, Menelaos, leader of hosts—\nWas it for us that the god showed this sign, or for you yourself?”\nSo he spoke. Menelaos the warlike was figuring in his mind\nthe right way to think, what might be his best response,\nwhen long-robed Helen got in ahead of him, saying:\n“Listen to me! I shall prophesy now, as the immortals\nput it into my heart, how I think it will come to pass.\nAs this eagle seized the goose brought up in our household,\nswooping down from the mountain where he was born and bred,\nso Odysseus—many ills borne, having wandered far—\nwill come back home and take vengeance, or maybe is home\nalready, and sowing the seeds of trouble for the suitors.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“So now may Zeus enact it, Here’s loud-thundering husband!\nThen there too I’d pray to you as I would to a god.”\nThat said,\nhe gave the horses a touch of the whip: they at once\ngalloped eagerly out of the city toward the plain,\nand strained all day at the yoke set about their necks,\ntill the sun went down and all the ways were in shadow,\nand they came to Pherai, to the dwelling of Diokles\nthe son of Ortilochos, whom Alpheios begot, and there\nthey spent the night, and he entertained them as guests.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthey harnessed the horses and boarded the inlaid chariot,\nand drove out from the forecourt and echoing colonnade.\nAt a touch of the whip the pair, nothing loath, sped forward,\nand soon made their way back to Pylos’ steep citadel.\nThen Telemachos spoke to the son of Nestor, saying:\n“Son of Nestor, will you promise to do the thing I’ll ask you,\nand then in fact do it? We’re friends of long standing ourselves\nbecause of our fathers’ friendship. Besides, we’re the same age,\nso this journey will simply establish our like-mindedness!\nDon’t take me on past my ship, Zeus’ nursling, but leave me there:\nI’m afraid the old man will detain me in his house against my will,\nthrough an urge to befriend me. I need to get home quickly.”\nSo he spoke; and the son of Nestor debated in his heart\nhow he might properly give this promise and fulfill it;\nand as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\nhe turned his horses toward the swift ship and the seashore,\nand there unpacked the fine gifts, laid them out in the ship’s stern—\nthe clothes and gold Menelaos had given Telemachos,\nwhom he now encouraged, addressed with winged words, saying:\n“Embark now, quickly, and summon all your comrades\nbefore I get home and break the news to the old man!\nFor this I know well, in my mind and heart: his spirit\nis so overbearing, he just won’t let you go—\nhe’ll come out here in person to escort you back: I don’t think\nhe’d mean to go home empty-handed! As it is, he’ll be very cross.”\nThat said, he drove off his beautiful-maned horses\nback to the Pylians’ township, and quickly reached his home.\nTelemachos meanwhile urged on his comrades, saying:\n“Put all the gear on the black ship in order, my comrades,\nand let’s embark ourselves, and then be on our way.”\nSo he spoke; they heard and promptly obeyed him,\nand embarked at once, and seated themselves at their rowlocks.\nNow while he was busy with prayer and sacrifice to Athene\nby the stern of the ship, he was approached by a person\nfrom a distant land, Argos—a fugitive murderer,\na seer, a man related by descent to Melampous,\nwho long ago was a dweller in Pylos, mother of flocks—\na wealthy Pylian, occupant of a very large house, but now\na stranger in other men’s country, fleeing from his own land\nand from great-hearted Neleus, noblest of living men,\nwho for a full year had kept his great wealth from him\nby main force, for Melampous lay shackled in Phylakos’ halls,\nunder harsh constraint, and suffering grievous hardship\nbecause of Neleus’ daughter, and the heavy infatuation\nwhich the Fury—that ruinous goddess—put in his mind.\nAnd yet\nhe escaped his fate, and drove off the loud-lowing cattle\nto Pylos from Phylake, paid out the godlike Neleus\nfor his misdeed, and brought the girl home as a wife\nfor his own brother. He himself went to other men’s land,\nto horse-pasturing Argos, where it was destined that he\nshould dwell, and hold sway over numerous Argives. There\nhe married a wife and established a high-roofed house,\nand sired Antiphates and Mantios, two sturdy sons.\nAntiphates later begot great-hearted Oikles, and\nOikles sired Amphiaraos, rouser of hosts, whom Zeus\nof the aegis and Apollo both held in great affection\nand befriended in every way. Yet he never reached old age’s\nthreshold, but died in Thebai because of a woman’s gifts.\nTo him were born two sons, Amphilochos and Alkmaion,\nwhile Mantios begot Polypheides and Kleitos. The latter\nDawn, golden-throned, snatched away because of his beauty,\nso that he might be numbered among the immortals;\nbut high-spirited Polypheides Apollo made a seer,\nby far the best of mortals, after Amphiaraos died.\nHe moved to Hyperesea when he fell out with his father,\nand there he made his home, and prophesied to all mortals.\nHis son it was, Theoklymenos by name, who now\ncame up and stood by Telemachos. He found him pouring\nlibations and praying, there by his black ship,\nand he spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Friend, since I find you at sacrifice in this place,\nI entreat you by these burnt offerings, by the god, and by\nyour own head, and by the comrades who travel with you,\nanswer what I ask truly, and hold back nothing:\nWho are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“So, stranger, let me answer your questions quite honestly:\nI’m from Ithake by birth, and my father is Odysseus—\nif ever he was—who by now must have met his grim destiny—\nwhich is why I’ve set out with my comrades in a black ship\nand have come seeking news of my long-absent father.”\nTheoklymenos the godlike responded to him, saying:\n“I likewise have left my country, after killing a man\nof my own clan: many brothers and kinsmen he has\nin horse-pasturing Argos, with great power over Achaians.\nIt’s to avoid meeting death and black fate at their hands\nthat I’m on the run. It’s my fate to wander among men.\nTake me aboard your ship, as your suppliant fugitive,\nlest they murder me, for I think they’re hot on my trail.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“I shall not, since you want it, debar you from my trim ship.\nCome aboard! We’ll look after you, with what little we have.”\nSo saying, he took the other’s bronze spear from him,\nand laid it at length on the deck of the shapely vessel,\nthen he himself embarked on the seagoing ship,\nand seated himself in the stern, and made a place beside him\nfor Theoklymenos too. His men cast off the stern warps,\nand Telemachos now issued orders to his comrades\nto belay the tackle, and they promptly obeyed him.\nThe fir-wood mast they raised up and stepped in the hollow\nmast block, held it in place with the forestays, and then\nhauled up the white sail with the halyards of plaited leather.\nGrey-eyed Athene now sent them a blustery tailwind,\ngusting through the bright air, so the ship might swiftly\ncomplete her journey, speeding over the briny deep.\n[They voyaged past The Springs, and sweet-streamed Chalkis],\ntill the sun went down and all the ways were in shadow,\nand the ship reached Pheai, driven on by the wind of Zeus,\nthen skirted bright Elis, where the Epeians hold sway.\nOnward from there Telemachos made for the Sharp Islands,\nuncertain in mind if he was going to dodge death or be captured.\nBack in the hut, Odysseus and the noble swineherd\nwere at supper: the other men were eating the meal with them.\nWhen they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nOdysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd,\nto see if he’d still befriend him, invite him to stay there\nin the farmstead, or urge him to try his luck in the city.\n“Hear me out now, Eumaios, and all you other comrades!\nIn the morning I’m minded to make my way to the city,\nto beg for food, and not be a burden on you and your fellows.\nSo advise me well, and give me a reliable guide\nto take me there. But I’ll need to wander through the city\non my own, perhaps be given some bread, a cup of water.\nI might even go to the house of noble Odysseus,\nand impart what news I have to prudent Penelope, mingle\nin the company of the suitors, overbearing though they are,\nto see if they’d spare me dinner from their limitless plenty.\nI could offer them, there and then, services they might need—\nlet me list them, and you pay attention and hear me out!—\nThrough the favor of Hermes the Guide, the god who endows\nthe endeavors of every man with elegance and renown,\nin the matter of service, no other mortal could match me:\nbuilding a fire well, or chopping up dry firewood,\nor carving and roasting meat, or pouring out the wine—\nall such things in which the common folk serve their betters.”\nDeeply disturbed you then answered him, swineherd Eumaios:\n“Oh my, stranger, what can have put such a notion\ninto your mind? You must be set on your own destruction\nif you mean to go in among this company of suitors,\nwhose violence and arrogance go up to the iron sky!\nNot such as you are the servants of these people:\nno indeed: it’s young men, well dressed in mantles and tunics,\ntheir heads always slick with oil, their faces handsome,\nwho wait on them: their tables are kept well polished,\nand are heavily laden with bread and meat and wine.\nNo, you stay here, where no one’s irked by your presence—\nneither I, nor any of the other men I have here.\nBut when the dear son of Odysseus comes back home,\nhe’ll fit you out with a cloak and tunic, and send you\nwherever your heart and spirit say you should go.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Eumaios, I wish you could be as dear to Zeus the Father\nas to me, whom you’ve saved from wandering and distress!\nThere’s no worse evil for mortals than vagrancy; and yet\nfor the sake of their cursed bellies men incur grim hardship\n[when wandering, grief, and pain assail any one of them].\nBut now, since you’re keeping me here, and want me to wait\nfor him, your master, now tell me of godlike Odysseus’ mother\nand father, whom he left here on the edge of old age—\nare they perhaps still living beneath the rays of the sun,\nor are they dead by now and in the realm of Hades?”\nThen the swineherd, leader of men, responded to him:\n“So, stranger, I’ll give your question a truthful answer.\nLaertes still lives, but constantly prays to Zeus\nthat the spirit may fade from his limbs within his halls,\nbecause of his terrible grief for the son who’s absent,\nand for his wise wedded wife, who by dying caused him\nmost sorrow, and brought him to old age before his time.\nShe died of grief, lamenting her glorious son—\na miserable death, that I’d wish no man to suffer\nthat lived here as my close friend and treated me kindly.\nSo long as she lived, though it was in a state of sorrow,\nIt gave me pleasure to ask and enquire after her, since she\nhad raised me herself, together with long-robed Ktimene,\nher clever daughter, whom she bore as her youngest child.\nWith her I was reared, and she favored me scarcely less.\nBut when we both reached the longed-for prime of youth,\nher they saw married on Same, and she had countless bride-gifts;\nbut me she clothed in a mantle and tunic, both\nof the finest stuff, shod me with sandals, and then sent me\nout on the estate. Yet at heart it was me she cared for more.\nThese days I go short of such things, yet the blessed gods\nprosper the work of my hands, at which I labor:\nthat lets me eat and drink, care for respected guests.\nYet from my mistress I hear nothing pleasant, either\nby word or deed, for an evil has fallen on the household—\nthese arrogant men! The servants greatly need and want\nto speak personally with their mistress, check each detail,\neat and drink, and then take some tid-bit back with them\nto the fields—such are the things as warm a servant’s heart.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Indeed, swineherd Eumaios, how little you must have been\nwhen parted so far from your country and your parents!\nBut come now, tell me this, and give me the true answer:\nWas the wide-wayed city of men destroyed in which\nyour father and lady mother had their dwelling?\nOr when you were out alone with your sheep or cattle,\ndid hostile men carry you off in their ships for sale here\nto your master’s house, and he paid a good price for you?”\nThen the swineherd, leader of men, responded to him, saying:\n“Stranger, since you’re questioning me about these matters,\nlisten in silence now at your ease, and drink your wine\nwhile you sit here. These nights are endless: you can sleep,\nyou can also listen for pleasure. No need to bed down\nbefore the time comes. Too much sleep can be exhausting.\nIf any one of the rest of you feels the urge to do so,\nlet him go out and sleep in the open: then, when it’s dawn,\nget a bite to eat, and take care of our master’s swine.\nBut we two will drink and feast in the hut, and enjoy\nhearing about each other’s wretched misfortunes\nas we recall them. A man looking back can find pleasure\neven in grief, one who’s suffered and wandered much.\n“So now let me answer the questions that you asked me.\nThere’s an island called Syria—you may have heard tell of it—\nat the turning points of the sun, out beyond Ortygie,\nIt’s not very populous, but possesses excellent terrain:\ngood for cattle and sheep, many vineyards, abundant wheat.\nNo famine ever afflicts this land, nor does any other\nhateful disease appear as a plague to wretched mortals,\nbut when the tribes of mankind grow old in the city,\nthen comes silver-bowed Apollo, together with Artemis,\nand assails and slays them with his gentle arrows.\nTwo cities there are: all the land’s divided between them,\nand over them both my father held sway as king—\nKtesios, Ormenos’ son, who was likened to the immortals.\n“Thither Phoenicians came, men famous for their ships,\nsharp traffickers, countless trinkets in their black vessel.\nNow there was in my father’s household a Phoenician woman,\ntall and good-looking, highly skilled in fine handiwork,\nand her these crafty Phoenicians set about to beguile.\nFirst, while she was washing clothes near the hollow ship,\none of them made love to her, a thing that fuddles the senses\nof truly feminine women, even one that’s well-behaved.\nThen he asked her who she was and from where, and she at once\npointed out my father’s high-roofed house, and declared:\n‘I come from Sidon, that bronze-rich city, and am\nthe daughter of Arybas, a man who had rivers of wealth;\nbut a bunch of Taphian pirates kidnapped me on my way\nback from the fields, and brought me here. I was sold\nto the man who lives up there, and he paid a good price for me.’\n“Then the man who’d secretly had her responded to her, saying:\n‘Would you like to go back with us now and get to see\nthe high-roofed house of your father and mother?—them too,\nfor they’re still alive, and the word is they’re very rich?’\n“Then the woman responded to him in these words, saying:\n‘This indeed might be done, if all you sailors were willing\nto swear an oath that you’d deliver me home unharmed.’\n“So she spoke, and they all swore the oath as she demanded.\nBut when they’d sworn, and completed the terms of the oath,\nthe woman addressed them again, in these words, saying:\n‘Keep quiet now, and let none of your crew accost me\nif we chance to encounter each other, either out on the street\nor at the well, in case someone goes to his dwelling\nand tells the old man, so that he becomes suspicious\nand keeps me closely confined, and plans your destruction.\nSo don’t forget what I say, and be quick with the barter\nfor your homeward voyage! When your ship is fully laden,\nthen contact me up at the house, and I will come,\nwith any gold I can find; and there’s one other thing\nI’d be glad to give you in return for my passage—a son\nof my master, whose house-nurse I am, a clever child\nwho trots along at my side when I go out: I’d bring him\naboard with me—he’d fetch you a gigantic price, wherever\nyou chose to sell him abroad to some foreign buyer.’\n“So she spoke, and went off back to the splendid mansion.\nThey stayed there in our country for an entire year,\nand by trafficking piled up the goods in their hollow ship.\nBut when the ship’s hold was full-laden for their return,\nthey then sent a messenger to alert the woman.\nA sharp-witted man it was that came to my father’s dwelling,\nbringing a golden necklace interlaced with amber beads.\nSo while in the hall the maidservants and my lady mother\nwere handling and looking at this and making their offer\nto buy it, the man nodded silently to the woman,\nand, having done this, departed, making for the hollow ship,\nand she took me by the hand, led me out of the house.\nThere in the forecourt she found the cups and tables\nof the men who’d been dining, associates of my father\nwho’d left for a council session, with public discussion.\nShe quickly hid three cups under the front fold of her dress\nand carried them off. In my innocence I went with her.\nSo the sun went down, and all the ways were in shadow,\nand we hurriedly made our way to the famous harbor\nwhere these Phoenician men’s swift ship was moored.\nThey now embarked, and sailed out over the watery ways,\nwith us two on board as well: Zeus gave us a tailwind.\nFor six days we sailed, both night and day; but when\nZeus, son of Kronos, brought on the seventh day,\nthen Artemis, divine archer, struck the woman down,\nand she fell in the bilge like a sea tern, with a thud.\nHer corpse they threw overboard to end as food for seals\nand fishes, and I was left there, grieving at heart.\nNow wind and wave in their passage carried us to Ithake,\nwhere Laertes bought me with his resources. Thus it was\nthat I first happened to set eyes on this country.”\nTo him then Odysseus, Zeus’ scion, responded, saying:\n“Indeed, Eumaios, you’ve stirred the spirit in my breast\nby telling me all the heartfelt sorrows you endured!\nYet surely you had some good along with the suffering\nfrom Zeus? After all your troubles you ended in the household\nof a decent man, who takes good care to provide you\nwith food and drink, and you have a good life; whereas I\ngot here as a vagrant, who’d strayed through many folks’ cities.”\nThese were the things they talked about to each other.\nNow they lay down and slept—briefly, not long, for soon\ncame fair-throned Dawn. And meanwhile Telemachos’ comrades\nmade landfall. They furled the sail, unstepped the mast,\nsmartly, and rowed the ship on till they reached their anchorage,\nthen belayed the stern warps, threw out the anchor stones,\nand themselves, disembarking on the strand of the seashore,\nprepared their meal, and mixed the bright red wine;\nand when they’d satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nsagacious Telemachos spoke first among them, saying:\n“The rest of you now row the black ship on to the city.\nI’m going out to inspect the fields and the herdsmen,\nand I’ll come into town this evening when I’ve seen to the estate.\nEarly tomorrow I’ll give you, as wages for your journey,\na square meal of meat, with some sweetly drinkable wine.”\nThen godlike Theoklymenos addressed him, saying:\n“Where should I go, dear child? To which particular house\nof the men in authority over rugged Ithake?\nOr shall I go straight to your house—yours and your mother’s?”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“In different circumstances I’d tell you to go to our house,\nwhere there’s no lack of hospitality; but for yourself\nthat’s not a good idea, since I’ll be away, and my mother\nwon’t see you: she seldom comes out in the house to face\nthe suitors, but works at her loom apart from them, upstairs.\nBut I’ll tell you another man to whom you can go instead—\nEurymachos, glorious son of skillful Polybos,\nwhom nowadays the Ithakans treat like a god, for he\nis their best man by far, as well as the most determined\nto marry my mother, acquire Odysseus’ privileges!\nYet Olympian Zeus alone, the sky-dweller, knows whether\nhe’ll meet with his day of ill destiny before that wedding.”\nAs he spoke, a bird flew by on the right: a falcon,\nApollo’s swift messenger, clutching a dove in its talons,\nand plucking its feathers, that were shed on the ground\nmidway between the ship and Telemachos himself.\nThen Theoklymenos called him aside from his comrades,\nand clasping him by the hand, exclaimed: “Telemachos,\nnot without some god’s will did that bird fly on our right!\nI knew, when I saw it, that this had to be an omen!\nThere is no other family that’s more kingly than yours\nin the whole realm of Ithake: you’ll hold power forever.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“If only these words of yours, stranger, might be fulfilled!\nThen would you quickly know friendship and gifts in plenty\nfrom me, so that any who met you would call you blessed.”\nThat said, he then addressed Peiraios, a faithful comrade:\n“Peiraios, son of Klytios, in all else you’re the most\nreliable of the comrades who accompanied me to Pylos:\nso now, please, take this stranger, give him a proper welcome\nin your home, with all due honor, until I come back.”\nPeiraios, famous spearman, responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, no matter how long you may stay out here,\nI shall take care of this man: as a guest he’ll lack for nothing.”\nSo saying, he boarded the ship, and ordered his companions\nto cast off the stern warps and to embark themselves.\nThey at once went on board, and sat down at their rowlocks.\nBut Telemachos shod himself in his well-made sandals,\nand took his sturdy spear, tipped with sharp-pointed bronze,\nfrom the deck of the ship. They cast off the stern warps,\npushed clear, and made for the city, just as Telemachos,\ndear son of godlike Odysseus, had ordered them to do.\nBut him his feet bore on, briskly striding, till he reached\nthe farmstead where were pigs unnumbered, beside which\nslept the good swineherd, with kind thoughts for his masters.\n",

         "\nThe two in the hut, Odysseus and the noble swineherd,\nhad stirred up the fire, and were making breakfast at dawn,\nand had sent out the herdsmen with droves of pigs to pasture.\nTheir usually noisy dogs now fawned round Telemachos,\nnot barking as he approached them. Noble Odysseus noticed\nboth the dogs’ silent fawning and the sound of footsteps,\nand at once he addressed Eumaios with winged words, saying:\n“Eumaios, there’s somebody coming here—one of your comrades,\nor some other acquaintance, because the dogs aren’t barking\nbut making up to him—and I can hear his footsteps.”\nHe’d not yet finished speaking when his own dear son\nappeared in the doorway. Amazed, the swineherd sprang up,\nand the vessels fell from his hands with which he’d been busy\nmixing the bright red wine. He went to greet his master\nand kissed his head and his two bright shining eyes\nand both his hands, tears falling thick and fast.\nAs a loving father welcomes his own dear son’s return\nfrom some distant land, after a ten-year absence—\nhis only son, late-born, for whose sake he’s suffered much—\nso now did the noble swineherd clasp godlike Telemachos\nand kiss him all over, as though he’d escaped from death,\nand, still weeping, then address him with winged words, saying:\n“You’re back, Telemachos, sweet light of my eyes! I thought\nI’d never see you again when you sailed off to Pylos!\nCome in now, dear child, and let me pleasure my heart\nwith the sight of you inside here, now you’ve arrived!\nFor you don’t often make visits to the herdsmen on the estate,\nbut stay in town: these days it would seem your fancy is\nto observe the baneful throng of these men, the suitors.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“So it shall be, old fellow. It’s on your account I’m here,\nto see you myself, and have you tell me whether\nmy mother is still in the house, or by now some other man\nhas got her in marriage, so that maybe Odysseus’ bed,\nfor lack of occupants, is full of foul spiders’ webs.”\nThen the swineherd, leader of men, responded to him, saying:\n“Indeed, she still holds on with an all too steadfast spirit\nhere in your halls, and always the sorrowful nights\nand days too waste her away with ceaseless weeping.”\nAfter thus speaking he took the bronze spear from him,\nand Telemachos entered, passing over the stone threshold.\nAs he approached, Odysseus, his father, offered him his seat,\nBut Telemachos, facing him, refused the offer, saying:\n“Sit down, stranger: we’ll find us another seat somewhere\nin our own farmstead—here’s the man’s who’ll set it for us.”\nSo he spoke. Odysseus sat down again. For Telemachos\nthe swineherd spread green brushwood, put a fleece over it,\nand Odysseus’ dear son now seated himself, and the swineherd\nset before each of them platters of roast meat\nleft over from what they’d eaten the day before,\nand hastily put fresh cuts of bread in the baskets,\nand in his ivy-wood bowl mixed some honey-sweet wine,\nand then sat down himself, facing godlike Odysseus.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them;\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nTelemachos then addressed the noble swineherd, saying:\n“Dad, where did this stranger come from? How did sailors\nbring him here to Ithake? Who did they say they were?\nFor I don’t imagine he made his way here on foot.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Very well, child: I’ll tell you the whole true story. He claims\nto be from broad Krete by birth. He says he’s wandered\nall over, from one human settlement to another,\na vagrant: that’s the fate some divinity spun for him.\nBut now he’s run away from a vessel of the Thesprotians\nand come to my farmstead. I put him into your hands.\nDo what you like with him. He says he’s your suppliant.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Eumaios, what you just said embarrasses me! For how\nam I to give this stranger a good welcome in my house?\nI’m only a youth still, I don’t trust the strength of my hands\nagainst any man who may pick a quarrel with me.\nAs for my mother, the heart in her breast is divided,\nwhether to stay there with me and run the household,\nrespecting her husband’s bed and the voice of the people,\nor to go off with whoever’s the best of the Achaians\nas a suitor there in her halls, who offers the richest gifts.\nAnd regarding this stranger, since he’s come to your home,\nI’ll clothe him in mantle and tunic, garments of quality,\nand give him a two-edged sword and sandals for his feet,\nand send him wherever his heart and spirit dictate.\nOr, if you like, keep him here and care for him in the farmstead,\nand I’ll send him down clothes and all the food he needs\nto eat, so he won’t be the ruin of you and your comrades.\nBut up there I won’t let him go, to sojourn among\nthe suitors, for they’re overweening and wanton, and may\nmock him: that would cause me the greatest embarrassment.\nIt’s hard for one man to get anything done against many,\nhowever strong he may be: they have far the greater power.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus now addressed him, saying:\n“Friend—surely it’s proper that I should reply—indeed\nyou rend my heart as I listen to all you tell me\nof the reckless acts that these suitors are now committing\nin your halls, against the will of one such as yourself!\nTell me, do you let yourself be oppressed? Or is it\nthat some god’s word has led your countrymen to hate you?\nOr is it your brothers you blame, whom a man relies on\nin a tight corner, even when a major feud arises?\nI wish I was really as young now as I am in spirit,\nor the son of peerless Odysseus, or the man himself—\nmight return from his wandering: there’s still room for hope:\nthen might some foreign mortal at once cut off my head\nif I didn’t prove myself a disaster to all those fellows\nwhen I came to the main hall of Laertes’ son Odysseus!\nWere they to overwhelm me, one man alone, by numbers,\nI’d much rather go down fighting, killed in my own home,\nthan have to go on witnessing these unseemly actions—\nstrangers maltreated, women servants forcibly dragged\nand manhandled everywhere in this beautiful building,\nwine recklessly squandered, men devouring my food\nwithout purpose or limit, no end to the business in sight.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“So, stranger, I’ll give you a full and truthful answer.\nThe people in general do not hate or resent me,\nnor have I brothers to blame, whom a man relies on\nin a tight corner, even when a major feud arises.\nThe fact is, our line’s been kept single by the son of Kronos:\nArkeisios sired Laertes, his one and only son;\nThen he in turn had one son, Odysseus; and Odysseus\nhad only me, left me here in his halls, got no joy of me.\nThat’s why countless enemies now occupy our house.\nFor all the highborn leaders who lord it over the islands—\nDoulichion, Same, and forested Zakynthos,\nbesides those who rule as princes in rugged Ithake—\nare all courting my mother, and wasting my property.\nShe neither rejects this hateful marriage nor is able\nto end the business; so they go on eating up my estate\nand waste it away—very soon they’ll tear me to pieces too!\nYet indeed all these matters rest on the knees of the gods.\nBut now, dad, you go quickly, tell strong-minded Penelope\nthat I’m safely back here for her, all the way from Pylos.\nI’m going to stay on here, and you come straight back yourself\nwhen you’ve told her, and only her: not a single other Achaian\nshould get wind of it. Many people are planning trouble for me.”\nTo him, then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\nBut come, tell me this, and give me an honest answer:\nShould I not, this same trip, also take the news to Laertes,\npoor man? For a while, despite his great grief over Odysseus,\nhe’d still keep an eye on the fields, still eat and drink\nwith the servants at home whenever the mood so took him;\nbut now, from the day when you went off by ship to Pylos,\nthey say he no longer eats or drinks as before,\nor goes out to the estate, but sits wailing and weeping\nin lamentation, and the flesh is wasting from his bones.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“That’s too sad, but for now we’ll leave him, despite our grief.\nFor if mortals somehow could have all they wanted, then\nour first choice would be the day for my father’s return.\nWhen you’ve given your message, come back. Don’t wander off\nover the fields after him, but instruct my mother\nto send off a servant, the housekeeper, as soon as may be,\nsecretly: she could take a message to the old man.”\nWith that he sent off the swineherd, who found his sandals,\nput them on, and left for the city. Nor did Athene fail\nto see the swineherd Eumaios depart from the farmstead,\nand herself approached now, in the likeness of a woman,\none tall and handsome, and skilled in fine handiwork.\nShe stood outside the hut’s entrance, visible to Odysseus;\nbut Telemachos neither saw her in front of him nor\nwas aware of her presence: gods are not clearly manifest to all.\nBut the dogs, like Odysseus, saw her: they didn’t bark, but slunk—\nterrified, whining—to the far side of the farmstead.\nShe nodded to noble Odysseus: he saw it, and went\nout from the hall, past the great wall of the courtyard,\nand stood before her. Athene then addressed him, saying:\n“Laertes’ son, Zeus’ scion, resourceful Odysseus,\nthe time has come: say the word to your son, don’t hide it,\nso that you both may plot death and doom for the suitors\nfor when you go back to the far-famed city: I myself\nshall not be slow to join you: I’m ready for this battle!”\nThat said, Athene touched him with her golden wand.\nShe dressed him first in a new well-laundered mantle\nand tunic, made his body more youthful and powerful.\nHis complexion grew swarthy again, his cheeks filled out,\nand the beard on his chin darkened once more. This done,\nshe took herself off, and Odysseus now went back\ninto the hut. His dear son was amazed at the sight,\nand averted his eyes in alarm, lest this might be a god,\nand spoke, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Stranger, you look quite different from what you did earlier:\nyou have different clothes on, your color isn’t the same!\nYou must be one of the gods who hold broad heaven!\nBe gracious, that we may bring you acceptable offerings\nand golden gifts, finely wrought. Only spare us, be merciful!”\nTo him then much-enduring noble Odysseus responded:\n“I am no kind of god! Why liken me to the immortals?\nNo, I am your father, for whose sake you are grieving\nand suffering much from the violence of men.”\nSo saying\nhe kissed his son, and the tears ran down his cheeks\nthat hitherto he’d always firmly held back; but Telemachos—\nnot yet convinced that this man was really his father—\nonce more spoke out, and responded to him, saying\n“You can’t be Odysseus, my father! No, this is some deity\nthat’s deceiving me, so that I’ll grieve more bitterly hereafter!\nThere’s no way a mortal man could contrive all this\nby his own unaided wit—it required a god to help him,\nwho could easily as he wanted make him either young or old.\nFor you, a moment ago, were an old man, meanly clad,\nwhereas now you resemble the gods who possess broad heaven.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Telemachos, it’s not fitting, when your own father is here,\nin the house, to be so astonished, indeed suspicious!\nI tell you, no other Odysseus will ever come here—\nIt is I, such as I am, who have suffered much, wandered far,\nand now, in the twentieth year, have come back home!\nWhat you see here’s the work of Athene, leader of hosts,\nwho transforms me however she wants, for she has the power—\nsometimes to resemble a beggar, then again in the likeness\nof a young man, his body decked out in expensive clothes!\nEasy enough for the gods, who possess broad heaven,\nboth to exalt a mortal man, and to debase him.”\nThat said, he sat down. Telemachos, shedding tears,\ncried out, and flung his arms round his own good father,\nand a longing arose in them both for lamentation:\ntheir sobs came thicker and louder than the cries of birds,\nvultures or sea eagles with hooked talons, whose chicks\nhunters stole from their nests before they were full-fledged—\njust as piteous were their sobs and the tears they shed.\nAnd now the sun’s light would have set on their lamentation\nhad not Telemachos asked a quick question of his father:\n“On what kind of ship, dear father, was it that sailors\nbrought you here to Ithake? And who did they claim to be?\nFor I don’t imagine you made your way here on foot.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus answered him, saying:\n“So then, my child, I’ll tell you the whole true story.\nThe Phaiakians brought me here, men famous for their ships—\nother men too they convey, whoever approaches them—\nand ferrying me asleep in a swift ship over the deep\nthey set me down on Ithake, and gave me splendid gifts,\nbronze and gold in plenty, and woven clothing,\nall of which by the gods’ grace is lying stored in caves.\nAnd now I’ve come here at Athene’s instigation\nso that we may make plans together for killing our enemies.\nSo come, count up and tell me the full tally of the suitors,\nthat I may know how many, and who, these fellows are,\nand after thinking it over in my peerless mind, decide\nwhether we two are sufficient to stand against them alone,\nwithout the aid of others, or will need to round up support.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“Father, I’ve always been told about your great renown,\nthat you were both a tough combatant and a shrewd planner;\nBut what you just said is too much, I’m astounded! No way\ncould two men fight so many, and strong men too!\nnot just a group of ten suitors, or even twice that,\nbut many, many more! Let me tally them for you:\nFrom Doulichion there are no fewer than fifty-two\nchosen youths, with six servants to wait on them;\nfrom Same, the count lists two dozen individuals;\nfrom Zakynthos, there are two score youths of the Achaians,\nand from Ithake itself, a dozen, all from the best families,\nand with these Medon the herald and the godlike minstrel,\nand a couple of serving men, skilled at carving roast meat.\nShould we encounter all these indoors, then bitter and desperate\nwould be the revenge that you’re here to take on their violence.\nSo, is there any supporter that you can you bring to mind,\nsomeone who’d gladly step forward to help the two of us?”\nThen much-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Well now, I’ll tell you, and you listen and pay attention,\nand decide for yourself if Athene with Zeus the Father\nwill suffice, or if I should find some other defender too.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Good indeed are these two defenders whom you mention,\nsitting high up there in the clouds: between them they rule\nthe rest of mankind, not to mention the immortal gods!”\nThen much-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Not long, for sure, will those two remain mere spectators\nof the fierce battle, when between the suitors and ourselves\nwhere Ares’ strength lies is decided, here in my halls!\nBut for now, at daybreak tomorrow you must be off\nback home, and mingle there with the arrogant suitors.\nAs for me, the swineherd will escort me later into town,\nin the likeness of a wretched and elderly beggar: and if\nin the house they mistreat me, still let the heart in your breast\nendure the sight of the pain I suffer; I may be dragged\nby the heels through the house, and then thrown out, or pelted\nwith missiles—nevertheless you must look on and bear it!\nYou can tell them to give over their mindless folly, using\ngentle words to dissuade them; but they won’t take\nany notice of you; for indeed, their fatal day is at hand!\nAnd another thing I’ll tell you, and you take it to heart:\nWhen Athene, resourceful counselor, puts it into my mind,\nI’ll nod my head to you, and you, when you see that,\nmust gather up all the weapons that are lying in the halls\nand stack them away at the back of the lofty storeroom,\nall of them; disarm the suitors with soothing words when they\nnote their absence, and start to ask you about them; say:\n‘I stored them away from the smoke, since they no longer look\nas they did when Odysseus left them on going off to Troy,\nbut are blackened with all the fire’s breath that’s got to them.\nAnd there’s a greater concern Kronos’ son has put in my mind,\nthat when you’re flushed with wine you may pick some quarrel\namong you and wound one another, and so disgrace\nyour feast and your wooing: for iron of itself attracts a man.’\n“But for us two alone leave behind two swords and two spears,\nand a couple of oxhide shields that we can heft in our hands,\nrunning up and seizing them; as for those fellows, Pallas\nAthene and Zeus the Counselor will befuddle their wits!\nAnd another thing I’ll tell you, and you take it to heart:\nIf indeed you are my son and of our blood, then don’t\nlet anyone know that Odysseus has come back home—\nDon’t break the news to Laertes, or to the swineherd, or\nto any household servant—or to Penelope herself!\nYou and I by ourselves will test the loyalty of the women,\nand also make trial of the menservants, find out which ones\nhonor the two of us, have respect for us in their hearts,\nand which are indifferent, and scorn you, man though you are.”\nThen his illustrious son responded to him, saying:\n“My father, I think you’ll find out the quality of my spirit\nsoon enough: I’m not enslaved by any slack-mindedness!\nHowever, I really think this plan of yours would profit\nneither one of us, therefore I urge you to reconsider.\nYou’d spend long hours, to no purpose, going round the estate\nmaking trial of each individual, while in your halls\nthose arrogant men, at ease, go on squandering your goods!\nRegarding the women, however, I do urge you to find out\nwhich of them disregard you, and which ones are innocent;\nbut as for the hands at the farmsteads, I’d prefer that we don’t\nmake trial of them now, but take care of that business later,\nif it’s true that you have some portent from aegis-bearing Zeus.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nBut meanwhile the well-built ship put in to Ithake\nthat had brought Telemachos and all his comrades from Pylos;\nand they, on coming into the deep-water harbor,\ndrove the black ship ashore, high up on dry land,\nwhere proud attendants unloaded their gear and promptly\ncarried off the resplendent gifts to the house of Klytios.\nThey sent a herald ahead to the house of Odysseus,\nto deliver a message to prudent Penelope—saying\nthat Telemachos had landed, but had ordered the ship\nto sail on to the city—so that the noble queen\nmight not become worried, and shed tears of tenderness.\nThe two of them, herald and swineherd, encountered each other\non the same errand, both bringing the news to Odysseus’ wife.\nSo when they arrived at the godlike queen’s abode,\nthe herald spoke up in the midst of the handmaids, saying:\n“By now, O queen, your dear son is back in this country.”\nBut the swineherd went up to Penelope, stood beside her,\nand passed on all that her dear son had told him to say;\nand when he’d delivered his whole message, he departed\nthe courtyard and hall, and went back among the pigs.\nThe suitors, however, were troubled, and downcast at heart,\nand went out from the hall past the great courtyard wall,\nand there, in front of the main gates, they sat down.\nEurymachos, Polybos’ son, was the first to address them, saying:\n“My friends, a great feat has been arrogantly accomplished\nby Telemachos—this voyage, which we thought he’d never make!\nSo now let us launch a black ship, the best one we have,\nand assemble a crew of sailors as oarsmen, who’ll bring\nword without delay to those others to sail back home at once.”\nHe’d not finished speaking when Amphinomos, looking round,\nsaw a vessel there in the deep-water harbor, its crew\nbusy furling the sail, and with oars in their hands.\nHe, with a cheerful laugh, now addressed his comrades, saying:\n“No need to send messages: here they are back home!\nEither some god told them this, or they themselves observed\nTelemachos’ ship sailing past, but couldn’t intercept it.”\nSo he spoke. They now got up and went to the seashore,\nand the crew drove the black ship ashore, high up on dry land,\nwhere proud attendants unloaded their gear, while they\nthemselves all went to assembly, but would not permit\nany others to sit with them, either young or old; and next\nEupeithes’ son Antinoos addressed them, saying: “Look here,\nsee how the gods have saved this fellow from harm!\nDay after day our lookouts perched up on the windy heights,\none succeeding another; and when the sun went down\nwe never spent nights ashore, but out on the deep sea\ncruised in a swift ship until the bright dawn came up,\nlying in wait for Telemachos, to capture and do away with\nthe man himself: but some deity brought him safely home.\nNow we here need to think up some other sorry end\nfor Telemachos, not let him escape us; I don’t think\nthat while he still lives this business of ours will flourish.\nHe himself is no slouch at planning and ideas,\nand the people here are no longer completely on our side.\nWe must act first, before this fellow brings all the Achaians\nto assembly—for I don’t think he’ll let up on us one whit,\nbut will give full play to his wrath, stand up among them all\nand report how we planned his murder, but failed to catch him;\nand they won’t approve of us on hearing of such low deeds,\nand may take low action themselves, expel us all\nfrom our homeland, so that we end up on foreign soil! We must\narrest him while he’s on his estate, well away from the city,\nor else on the road. We can then seize his property\nourselves, share it fairly between us—but leave the house\nfor his mother to occupy, and whichever man marries her.\nStill, if you dislike this proposal, would rather choose\nthat he stay alive, and keep all his ancestral wealth, then we\nshould stop consuming his nice rich store of goods\ngathering here: let each one of us rather court her\nfrom his own halls with gifts, seek to win her; she’ll then marry\nwhoever offers the most, who comes as her destined man.”\nSo he spoke, and each one of them became hushed in silence.\nAmphinomos was the next man to speak and address them,\nthe illustrious son of lord Nisos, Aretias’ son. He led\nthe suitors who came from Doulichion, rich in wheat\nand pasture; he was the one whose conversation\nmost pleased Penelope: he had an intelligent mind.\nHe, with friendly intent, now spoke before the assembly:\n“My friends, I’d myself prefer that we should not do away with\nTelemachos: it’s a most serious business, this spilling\nof royal blood. No, we must first learn the will of the gods.\nIf the ordinances of great Zeus confer their approval,\nthen I will kill him myself and urge the rest to do so;\nbut should the gods dissuade us, then I say we must desist.”\nSo spoke Amphinomos. They agreed with what he said,\nso they now got up, and left for the house of Odysseus,\nand on arrival sat down on the polished chairs there.\nNow prudent Penelope made a fresh decision: to show\nherself to her suitors, so outrageous and arrogant;\nfor she’d learnt in her halls of the plan to murder her son\nfrom Medon the herald, who’d overheard their discussion.\nNow she went down to the hall along with her handmaids;\nand when, bright among women, she reached the suitors,\nshe stood by the pillar supporting the close-packed roof,\nand, holding the shining veil in front of her face, upbraided\nAntinoos, addressing him by his name, and saying:\n“Antinoos, wantonly violent, deviser of evil! Yet they say\nthat you beat all those of your age in the land of Ithake\nas speaker and counselor! But such a man you are not!\nYou madman, why are you plotting death and destruction\nfor Telemachos? Why ignore those suppliants who have\nZeus as their witness? To plot evil against each other\nis impious! Don’t you know how your father came here in terror,\non the run from his countrymen, who were furious with him\nbecause he’d joined up with a group of Taphian pirates\nto raid the Thesprotians, when these were allies of ours?\nSo they were hot to waste him, to rip out his life spirit,\nand wholly devour his great and abundant livelihood.\nBut Odysseus held and restrained them, despite their urgency.\nIt’s his substance you eat without payment, his wife you’re courting,\nhis son whom you plan to kill. This distresses me greatly.\nSo stop it, I tell you, and make the others stop too.”\nThen Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, responded to her, saying:\n“Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelope, please don’t worry!\nYou’ve no need to let these matters disturb your mind.\nThat man does not live, nor shall do so, nor shall ever be born\nwho’ll lay violent hands on your son Telemachos\nso long as I’m still alive and have sight upon this earth!\nFor this I’ll declare to you, and indeed it shall come to pass:\nstraightway would his black blood gush out around my spear,\nsince indeed me too Odysseus, that sacker of cities,\nused often to set on his knees, would put morsels of roast\nmeat into my hands, and hold the red wine to my lips.\nSo Telemachos is by far the dearest of men to me,\nand he has no need, let me tell him, to fear death—not, at least,\nat the suitors’ hands. From the gods, there’s no dodging it.”\nThus he spoke,\nto cheer her, while planning Telemachos’ death himself.\nShe now went back to her shining upper chamber\nand there wept for Odysseus, her dear husband, until\ngrey-eyed Athene shed sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\nAt evening, the noble swineherd returned to Odysseus\nand his son, and they set about preparing their supper,\nhaving slaughtered a yearling pig. Then Athene approached,\nand standing beside Odysseus, son of Laertes, tapped him\nwith her wand, and once more made him an elderly man,\nand put threadbare clothing on him, for fear the swineherd\nmight recognize him at sight, and then go off and tell\nprudent Penelope, not keep the news to himself.\nTelemachos was the first to address the swineherd, saying:\n“You’re back, noble Eumaios! What news is there from town?\nAre the proud suitors returned by now from their ambush,\nor still watching out for me on my homeward journey?”\nTo him swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“I wasn’t concerned to go wandering all through town\nenquiring about this matter: my mind was made up\nto hurry back here once I’d delivered my message. A swift\nmessenger from your comrades then met up with me,\na herald, who was the first to break the news to your mother.\nAnd there’s one other thing I know, which I saw for myself:\nI was well up above the city—where the hill of Hermes is—\non my way, when I noticed a fast ship putting in\nto our harbor: there was a crowd of men aboard her,\nand she was loaded down with shields and two-edged spears,\nand I thought that it must be them, but I can’t be certain.”\nSo he spoke; and Telemachos, princely in power, smiled,\nwith a quick glance at his father, but avoiding the swineherd’s eye.\nWhen they’d finished their work and got their supper ready,\nthey sat down to eat: no one lacked his fair share of the meal.\nAnd when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\ntheir minds turned to rest, and they welcomed the gift of sleep.\n",

         "\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nTelemachos, dear son of godlike Odysseus, then\nfastened under his feet his fine sandals, picked out\na sturdy spear, that was comfortably fitted to his grasp,\nand, eager to leave for town, addressed the swineherd, saying:\n“Old fellow, I’m off to the city now, so that my mother\nmay actually see me: I have a feeling she won’t\ngive over her ghastly wailing and tearful lamentation\nuntil she sees me in person! Here’s what I want you to do:\nTake this unfortunate stranger into town, so he can\nbeg there for his dinner: whoever so wishes can give him\na crust and a cupful. No way can I burden myself with\nthe rest of mankind, with these troubles of my own!\nIf this angers the stranger, so much the worse for him\nwill it be: it’s my pleasure to speak the honest truth.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Friend, neither do I myself want to be kept back here!\nFor a beggar it’s better to beg for his dinner in town\nthan out in the country: whoever so wishes can feed me.\nNo longer am I of an age to hang on here at the farmstead\nand do whatever some man in charge tells me I must!\nOff you go: this fellow here will take me as you ordered—\nwhen I’ve warmed myself at the fire, and the sun heats up!\nFor the clothes I have on are threadbare: I might be overcome\nby the dawn frost. You say, too, it’s a long way into town.”\nSo he spoke. Telemachos went out through the farmstead\nwith rapid strides, busy thinking up trouble for the suitors.\nWhen he reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, he stood\nthe spear he was carrying up against a lofty pillar,\nand himself went in, stepping over the stone threshold.\nThe first to see him by far was the old nurse Eurykleia\nas she spread fleeces over the richly decorated chairs.\nWeeping, she rushed to greet him, and the other handmaids\nof stout-hearted Odysseus now came crowding round them\nand kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome.\nNow prudent Penelope came down from her chamber,\nin appearance like Artemis, or like golden Aphrodite,\nand burst into tears as she hugged her own dear son,\nand kissed his head and both his bright shining eyes,\nand, between sobs, addressed him in winged words, saying:\n“You’re back, Telemachos, sweet light of my eyes! I thought\nI’d never see you again when you sailed off to Pylos—\nagainst my will, secretly, to seek news of your dear father!\nSo come now, tell me in detail what sightings you had of him.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to her, saying:\n“Mother, don’t make me cry, don’t stir up my emotions\nwhen I’ve only just escaped sheer destruction! Instead\ngo upstairs to your chamber, take your handmaids with you,\nand wash yourself, put on a set of clean clothes,\nthen pray to all the gods, with full, perfect sacrifices,\nthat Zeus may one day enact deeds of retribution for us!\nI shall now go to the place of assembly, and invite home\nthe guest that came with me on my voyage back from Pylos.\nI sent him on ahead with my godlike comrades, and told\nPeiraios to take him back to his house, and give him\na kindly welcome, look after him till I myself arrived.”\nSo he spoke: her own answer remained unwinged.\nShe washed herself, and put on a set of clean clothes,\nand vowed to make full, perfect sacrifices to all\nthe gods if Zeus would enact deeds of retribution for them.\nTelemachos made his way out through the hall, his spear\ngrasped in one hand, two hunting dogs following at his heels,\nand marvelous was the grace that Athene shed upon him,\nso that all the people gazed at him in amazement as he came,\nand the haughty suitors now gathered all around him,\nspeaking fair words, but privately plotting trouble.\nHe, however, avoided the main crowd, and went over\nto where Mentor, Antiphos, and Halitherses were sitting,\nmen who from the start had been his father’s comrades,\nand sat with them, and they questioned him on every detail\nof his trip. Peiraios, famed spearman, then came over,\nbringing the stranger through the city to the assembly.\nTelemachos was not slow to join his guest, but approached him.\nFirst to speak was Peiraios, who now addressed him, saying:\n“Telemachos, send women over to my house now, at once,\nso I can deliver to you the gifts Menelaos gave you.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Peiraios, we don’t yet know how this business may turn out.\nIf the haughty suitors secretly slay me in my own halls,\nand share out all my family goods between them, then\nI want you, not one of them, to keep and enjoy these things;\nBut if I contrive death and destiny for that lot, then\nbring all the stuff to my house, and I’ll be glad to get it.”\nThat said, he took the stranger, so sorely tried, back home.\nWhen they reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, they took off\ntheir cloaks and laid them on the seats and the high chairs\nand went off to the polished bathtubs and had baths.\nAfter the handmaids had washed them, massaged them with oil,\nand dressed them in woolen mantles and tunics, they came\nout from the bathtubs and seated themselves on the chairs,\nand a servant brought hand-washing water in a beautiful\ngolden ewer and poured it over a silver basin\nso they could wash, and drew up a polished table for them.\nThe respected housekeeper brought in bread and served it\nalong with many side dishes, giving freely of what there was.\nHis mother sat facing Telemachos by the hall’s main pillar,\nsettled back in her chair, spinning fine yarn on her distaff.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nBut when they had satisfied their desire for food and drink,\nit was prudent Penelope who opened the conversation, saying:\n“Telemachos, I’m going back now to my upper chamber,\nto lie down on my bed, that’s become a bed of sorrow,\nalways damp with my tears, ever since Odysseus set out\nwith the sons of Atreus for Ilion. Yet you couldn’t be bothered,\nbefore the haughty suitors arrived in the house, to tell me\nany clear news you may have about your father’s return.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“Very well, mother, I’ll give you a true and complete account.\nWe traveled to Pylos, to Nestor, shepherd of the people,\nwho gave me a warm welcome in his lofty dwelling\nas an honored guest, the way a father might treat his son\nback home from a long spell abroad: with just such kindness\nhe looked after me, both he and his glorious sons.\nBut of steadfast-minded Odysseus, living or dead, he told me\nhe’d heard not one thing, from any man on earth.\nHe sent me to Atreus’ son, famed spearman Menelaos,\nin a carpentered chariot drawn by his own horses;\nand there I saw Argive Helen, on whose account, and by\nthe gods’ will, Argives and Trojans endured such hardship.\nThen straight off Menelaos, good at the war cry, asked me\nwhat it was I’d come in search of to lordly Lakedaimon.\nWhereupon I then told him the whole truth of the matter.\nAt this he responded to me with the following statement:\n‘I tell you, it was indeed in the bed of a brave warrior\nthat these fellows, cowards themselves, hoped they might lie!\nAs when in a thicket, the lair of a powerful lion,\na doe has laid to sleep her newborn suckling fawns\nand goes off, traversing foothills and grassy glens\nin search of pasture, and the lion returns to his den\nand on both her fawns unleashes a ghastly fate—just so\nwill Odysseus unleash a ghastly fate on these men!\nHow I wish—by Zeus the Father and Athene and Apollo!—\nthat he, as strong as he was that time in well-built Lesbos\nwhen he stood up and wrestled a bout with Philomeleides,\nand threw him down forcefully, and all the Achaians cheered,\nmight come—he, Odysseus—in such strength among these suitors!\nThen they’d all get a swift end and a bitter marriage!\nAs regards the business you’re enquiring about, I shan’t\nveer off onto other subjects, nor will I mislead you—\nof all that I heard from that forthright Old Man of the Sea\nnot one word will I keep back or conceal from you!\nHe said he’d seen Odysseus on an island, much frustrated,\nin the halls of the nymph Kalypso, who by constraint\ndetains him there, so he can’t get back to his own country:\nfor he has no ships with oars, nor any comrades\nto further his voyage over the broad back of the sea.’\n“So spoke Atreus’ son, the famed spearman Menelaos.\nWhen I’d done all this, I set out: the immortals gave me\na following wind, and a speedy voyage to my own country.”\nSo he spoke, and stirred the heart in her breast with his words.\nThen the godlike Theoklymenos also addressed them, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, truly\nyour son knows nothing for certain!! Listen rather to me,\nfor I shall foretell the truth to you, hold back nothing!\nZeus, first of gods, be my witness, and this guest-friendly board,\nand the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\nthat Odysseus is already here, in his own homeland, sitting\nquiet or stealing about, learning of these misdeeds,\nand planting the seeds of destruction for all the suitors:\nsuch the bird portent I noted as I sat on the well-benched\nship of Telemachos here, and duly expounded to him.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“If only these words of yours, stranger, might be fulfilled!\nThen would you quickly know friendship and gifts in plenty\nfrom me, so that any who met you would call you blessed.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nMeanwhile, out in front of Odysseus’ house, the suitors\nwere amusing themselves by throwing discus and javelin\non the leveled terrace as always, in their arrogance. But when\nthe time for dinner arrived, and the flocks were coming home\nfrom the fields on every side, led by their usual herdsmen,\nthen they were summoned by Medon—who pleased them best\nof the heralds, and was present at their dinners—saying:\n“Young men, now you’ve all pleasured your hearts with sport,\ncome on into the house, so we can get dinner ready,\nfor it’s no bad thing to have meals at the proper time.”\nSo he spoke, and they stood up and obeyed his summons.\nWhen they entered the pleasantly sited house they took off\ntheir cloaks and laid them down on the chairs and benches,\nand set about slaughtering big sheep and fattened goats,\nand plumped-up porkers, and a cow from the herd, as they\nmade ready their meal.\nNow Odysseus and the noble swineherd\nwere preparing to leave the countryside, go in to town;\nand the swineherd, leader of men, spoke first, declaring:\n“Stranger, since you’re so eager to go off into the city\ntoday, as my master commanded—though I myself\nwould rather have left you here to watch over the farmstead—\nnevertheless I respect him, and fear that he might\nreprimand me later, and a master’s rebukes can be harsh—\ncome on now, let’s be going: the day is nearly over,\nit will soon be evening, and a little too cold for you.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\nBut yes, let’s be going. Be my guide all the way. And give me—\nif there’s one around that’s been cut for your use—a strong\nstaff to support me. You said the road was uneven.”\nWith that he slung over his shoulder his worn-out leather bag,\ntattered and rent, which was held by a twisted cord,\nand Eumaios gave him a staff that was to his liking,\nand the two set out. Dogs and herdsmen were left behind\nto look after the farmstead, while the swineherd led his master\ninto town, in the guise of a miserable aged beggar\npropped on a staff, wearing mean and threadbare clothes.\nBut when, as they made their way along the stony path,\nthey’d come close to the city, and had reached a spring, from which,\npaved and fair-flowing, the townsfolk got their water—\ndeveloped by Ithakos, Neritos, and Polyktor,\nwith a grove of black waterside poplars that encircled it\non every side, and the chill water came flowing down\nfrom the rocks above, and up high there was built an altar\nto the nymphs, where all travelers made offerings—there\nMelanthios son of Dolios overtook them while driving\nthose she-goats that were the very best from all his herds\nfor the suitors’ dinner; two herdsmen accompanied him.\nWhen he saw them, he reviled them, addressing them personally\nin aggressive, unseemly terms, that enraged Odysseus’ heart:\n“Now here comes a total no-good leading a no-good! As usual,\nthe god’s bringing like and like together! Where, pray,\nyou wretched swineherd, are you taking this old bald pig,\nthis tiresome beggar, this walking blot on our feasts?\nHe’ll stand and rub his shoulders at many doorposts,\nbegging for scraps, but never for swords or cauldrons!\nIf you gave me this dolt to be a guard on my farmstead,\nto sweep out the pens and fetch green shoots for the kids,\nthen by drinking whey he could build up his thigh muscles!\nBut since all he’s learned is bad stuff, he won’t be willing\nto do real work—he’d rather slouch his way through\nthis district begging, to feed his bottomless belly!\nI’ll tell you one thing straight, that will certainly come to pass:\nif he hangs around the residence of godlike Odysseus, then\nthere’ll be plenty of footstools shied by men at his head\nthat his ribs will splinter as he’s pelted throughout the house.”\nSo he spoke. As he passed, in his folly he kicked Odysseus\non the hip, yet failed to knock him clear of the path.\nOdysseus stood there unshaken, pondering whether\nhe should attack with his staff, and beat the life out of him,\nor collar him by the waist, dash his head on the ground.\nBut he steeled himself, and endured. The swineherd stared\nin rebuke at this fellow, raised his arms, and prayed aloud:\n“You nymphs of the spring, Zeus’ daughters, if Odysseus\never burned thigh pieces for you, wrapped in rich fat,\nof lambs or kids, then grant me fulfillment of this prayer:\nmay that man, my master, return, and divinity guide him!\nThen would he scatter all those glorious airs that you\nflaunt in your arrogance now, always strutting around\nthis township, while useless herdsmen bring the flocks to ruin.”\nThe goatherd Melanthios responded to him, saying:\n“My oh my, how this dog rants, mind full of malice!\nOne day I’ll carry him off in a well-benched black ship,\nfar away from Ithake, where he might bring me a fortune.\nOh, I wish silver-bowed Apollo would strike down Telemachos\ntoday in his halls, or the suitors would kill him, as surely\nas for Odysseus, far off, the day of return’s been lost.”\nSo saying, he left them behind there, as they walked slowly on,\nwhile he moved fast, and soon reached his master’s house.\nHe went straight in, and sat down among the suitors,\nfacing Eurymachos, the friend whom he liked the best.\nThe carvers set before him a portion of roast meat, while\nthe respected housekeeper brought him bread, and placed it\nready to eat. Now Odysseus and the noble swineherd\nstopped when they got near; about them rang the notes\nof the hollow lyre, for Phemios was preparing to sing for them.\nThen Odysseus clutched the swineherd’s hand, and said:\n“Eumaios, surely this is Odysseus’ fine house? It’s easily\ndistinguishable from the rest, even when there are many.\nOne building’s linked to another, and the courtyard’s fitted\nwith wall and copestones, its doors are finely worked\nand double-paneled: no man could furnish it better. And I\nobserve that within there’s a feast for many in progress,\nfor the smell of roast meat rises from it, and within it echoes\nthe lyre, made by the gods an accompaniment to feasting.”\nTo him then, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“Easily did you know it, for in all else you don’t lack sense.\nBut now we have to think how we shall act next.\nYou could go first into this pleasantly sited house,\nand mix with the suitors, while I stay out here. Or else,\nif you like, you stay here, and I’ll go in before you.\nBut don’t linger outside too long, or someone might notice,\nand hit you or chase you off. Do please be careful.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Noted and understood. You’re spelling it out for the wise.\nYou go on ahead, and I’ll stay behind out here—\nI’m not unused to being hit, or having things thrown at me.\nMy spirit is steadfast, for I’ve suffered many setbacks\nfrom rough seas and in war: let this be added to them!\nBut a ravening belly there’s no way of concealing—\nan accursed plague, that brings many evils upon mankind.\nFor its sake, too, well-benched ships are armed and sent\nout on the unharvested sea, bearing ills to their enemies.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nNow a dog lying there raised its head and pricked up its ears—\nArgos, stout-hearted Odysseus’ dog, that he, years ago,\nhad bred up himself, but got no joy of, departing too soon\nfor sacred Ilion. Young hunters used to take Argos\nto go in pursuit of wild goats, or deer, or hares; but now\nhe lay neglected, his master long since absent,\nin the abundant dung of the mules and oxen left\noutside the gates, until the servants of Odysseus\ncarted it off to manure his widespread estate. There lay\nthe dog Argos now, his body crawling with dog ticks.\nBut the moment he sensed that it was Odysseus nearby\nhe wagged his tail and laid back both ears, and yet\nno longer had the strength to move any closer to\nhis master, who now looked away, and wiped off a tear\nthat he easily hid from Eumaios, then questioned him, saying:\n“Eumaios, it’s odd, this dog lying here in the dung—\nhe has a good body, but I still can’t really be certain\nif he once had the speed to match his fine appearance,\nor was nothing more than one of those table dogs\nthat their masters take care of only to put on a show.”\nTo him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“This is indeed the dog of a man who died far away.\nIf he were such today, in body and performance,\nas he was when Odysseus left him, and set out for Troy,\nyou’d at once be astonished on seeing his speed and strength!\nNo wild beast that he started in the thick woodland’s depths\never escaped him. He was also a keen-nosed tracker.\nBut now he’s in a poor way, and his master has perished\nfar from his homeland. The women are heedless, can’t be bothered\nto care for him. Servants no longer directed by their master\nwon’t perform their duties properly any more,\nfor far-seeing Zeus strips away half the proper worth\nfrom any man, once the day of slavery overtakes him.”\nSo saying, he went on into the pleasantly sited building\nand made straight for the hall to join the noble suitors.\nBut Argos the fated lot of black death overwhelmed\nonce he’d seen Odysseus again, in the twentieth year.\nGodlike Telemachos was the first by far to notice\nthe swineherd advancing through the house, and at once\ninvited him with a nod. Eumaios looked round and seized\na nearby stool, on which the carver would sit to cut\nall the portions of meat for the suitors feasting there\nin the hall. This he took and placed at Telemachos’ table,\nopposite him, and sat down himself. A herald now set\na portion of meat before him, with bread from a basket.\nVery soon after him Odysseus entered the building\nas he was, in the guise of a miserable aged beggar\npropped on a staff, wearing mean and threadbare clothes.\nHe sat down on the ash-wood threshold inside the doorway,\nleaning back on the doorpost of cypress, which long ago\na craftsman had skillfully planed and made true to the line.\nTelemachos now beckoned the swineherd over to him,\ntook a whole loaf from the exquisite basket, together\nwith all the meat he could pick up in both hands, and said:\n“Take this, a gift for the stranger. Tell him he should himself\ngo round among all the suitors, begging. Embarrassed restraint\nis not a useful emotion for a man who’s in need.”\nSo he spoke;\nthe swineherd, on hearing his order, went up to Odysseus,\nand standing close, addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Stranger, Telemachos gives you this, says you should\ngo round among all the suitors, begging. Embarrassed restraint\nis not a useful emotion, he says, for a man who begs.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“Zeus, lord, grant that Telemachos prosper among his peers,\nand may all that his heart desires be accomplished for him.”\nWith that he received the food in both hands and laid it\ndown at his feet on his tattered old leather bag and ate\nwhile the minstrel was still performing there in the hall.\nBut when he’d eaten dinner, and the divine minstrel was done,\nthe suitors’ noisy clamor resumed in the hall. Now Athene,\nstanding close beside Odysseus, Laertes son, urged him on,\nto go round among the suitors, collect his crusts of bread,\ndiscover which were right-thinking, which lawless. Yet even so\nshe’d no plan to save a single one of them from destruction.\nOff he went to beg of them, moving from left to right,\nwith outstretched hand all round, as though he’d long been at it.\nThey felt pity, and gave, and regarded him with wonder,\nquestioning who he might be, and where he came from.\nThe goatherd Melanthios now addressed them, saying:\n“Listen to me, you suitors of our illustrious queen!\nAbout this stranger: I’ve actually seen him before—in fact\nit was the swineherd who brought him back here, but I\ndon’t know the man himself, or who he claims as family.”\nSo he spoke. Antinoos then chastised the swineherd, saying:\n“You infamous swineherd, why did you bring this fellow\nhere into town? Don’t we have enough vagrants already,\nthese tiresome beggars who disrupt our feasts? Is it not\nenough for you that such men should cluster here and guzzle\nour lord’s livelihood, that you bring in this fellow too?”\nTo him, swineherd Eumaios, you then responded, saying:\n“High-born you may be, Antinoos, but that was not well said.\nFor who’d himself seek out and invite any stranger\nfrom abroad, except maybe some kind of public worker—\na prophet, a healer of sickness, a carpenter—even a godlike\nminstrel, who gives delight with his singing? Such men\nare invited worldwide on mankind’s boundless earth,\nbut no man would bring in a beggar to devour his substance!\nYou’re always too severe, more than the rest of the suitors,\non Odysseus’ servants, on me above all—although\nI don’t care, so long as prudent Penelope and godlike\nTelemachos are here, both still living in these halls.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Silence! Never waste words in answering this man!\nAntinoos has an old habit of meanly provoking people\nwith his rough language, and urges others to do the same.”\nThat said, he addressed Antinoos with winged words, saying:\n“Antinoos, truly you care for me like a father his son, the way\nyou tell me to drive this stranger away from our halls with words\nof enforcement! May no god bring this about! Take something,\nand give it him! Far from begrudging you, I command it!\nDon’t worry about my mother, or the rest of the household\nservants resident here in the house of godlike Odysseus!\nBut in fact this isn’t the kind of thought in your breast:\nyou’d far rather eat yourself than give to somebody else.”\nTo him then in turn Antinoos responded: “Telemachos,\nhigh-flown speaker, in anger unbridled, what’s this you said?\nIf all the suitors would offer him just what I do, then\nfor three months this house would keep him at a distance!”\nSo saying, he seized and brought out from beneath the table\nthe footstool on which he rested his sleek feet while feasting.\nThe others, more generous, filled Odysseus’ old bag\nwith crusts and meat. Now Odysseus was on his way\nback to the entrance, after making free trial of the Achaians,\nbut he stopped by Antinoos, and said to him: “Give, friend!\nYou don’t look to me like the meanest of the Achaians,\nbut rather the noblest, for you have the air of a king!\nSo it’s right that you should give me an even larger portion\nof food than the rest, and I’d spread your fame worldwide!\nFor I too once dwelt in my own rich house among other\nprosperous men, and I often would give to a vagrant,\nno matter what sort he was or what he might be lacking!\nCountless servants I had, and much else in abundance\nowning which men live well, and are known as wealthy.\nBut Kronos’ son Zeus lost me all—on some whim, I suppose—\nby inciting me to go off, with a bunch of roving pirates\nto Egypt—a lengthy voyage—and meet my ruin there.\nWell, in the river of Egypt I anchored my curved vessels.\nThen I issued orders to my trusty comrades, to stay\nthere with the ships, and to be those ships’ protectors\nwhile I sent off scouts to find and man lookout posts.\nBut, trusting their strength, they yielded to wanton aggression,\nand at once began ravaging the Egyptians’ splendid fields,\ncarrying off their wives and their little children,\nand killing the men. Word quickly reached the city,\nand, hearing the shouting, people came out at daybreak.\nThe whole plain filled up with infantry and horses\nand the bright glint of bronze. Zeus, hurler of thunderbolts,\ncast a craven panic upon my comrades: nobody dared\nto stand firm and face the foe, for trouble confronted us\non every side. Many of us they slew with the sharp bronze;\nothers they led off alive, to do forced labor for them.\nBut me they sent on to Cyprus with a chance-met stranger,\nDmetor, Iasos’ son, a powerful Cypriot prince.\nFrom there I’ve come here, with much hardship on the way.”\nTo him Antinoos then responded, saying: “What god\nhas delivered this nuisance, this spoiler of feasts, to us?\nYou, keep your distance, stand well away from my table,\nor you’ll soon find yourself in a bitter Egypt and Cyprus,\nthe right place for the bold and shameless beggar you are!\nYou make your pitch to each man in turn, and they give\nthoughtlessly, since there’s no restraint and no compunction\nin handing out other men’s stuff, and everyone has so much.”\nAt this resourceful Odysseus took a step back, and said:\n“I see your mind’s no match for your looks! You wouldn’t\nspare even salt from your home store for your own suppliant,\nand though at another man’s table, you’re still reluctant\nto break off a crust and give it me! Yet there’s plenty here.”\nSo he spoke, and Antinoos grew yet more enraged at heart.\nStaring angrily, he addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Indeed, you’ll no longer get safely back, I think,\nout through this hall, now you’re bandying insults too.”\nSo saying, he threw the footstool, struck Odysseus’ right shoulder\nat the base, where it joins the back; but he stood rock firm.\nAntinoos’ missile failed to floor him. He said nothing,\njust shook his head, mind deeply pondering trouble. Then\nhe made his way back to the threshold and seated himself,\nand set down his well-filled bag, and addressed the suitors, saying:\n“Listen to me, you suitors of the illustrious queen,\nto what the heart in my breast now urges me to tell you!\nThere’s no pain felt by the mind, nor any sorrow, when\na man takes a hit who’s fighting to save his own possessions—\ncattle, maybe, or flocks of white sheep—but Antinoos\nstruck me because of my wretched belly, that damnable\nplague, the source of so much trouble for mankind!\nIf beggars have their own gods or Furies, then may death’s\nend find Antinoos before ever he comes to marriage!”\nThen Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, responded to him, saying:\n“Sit still and eat quietly, stranger, or go off somewhere else,\nor the young men may seize you, by hand or foot, for the way\nyou talk, and tear you apart, and throw you out of the house.”\nSo he spoke, indignant and headstrong, but they all rebuked him,\nand thus would one of these overproud youths address him:\n“Antinoos, you did wrong to strike this luckless vagrant!\nIf he turns out to be some god from heaven, you’re done for!\nAnd the gods do assume the form of some stranger from afar,\ntake on any shape, to wander through our cities\nobserving both good governance and its violent transgressions.”\nSo spoke the suitors; but he paid no heed to their words,\nand Telemachos nursed great sorrow at heart because\nof the blow to his father, yet shed no tear on the ground\nbut just shook his head, mind deeply pondering trouble.\nWhen prudent Penelope was informed about the assault\non the man in the hall, she exclaimed, among her handmaids:\n“May Apollo, renowned archer, so strike you yourself!”\nTo her then responded Eurynome, the housekeeper, saying:\n“Would that our prayers might find fulfillment! Then not\none of these men would live till another fine-throned Dawn.”\nPrudent Penelope replied to her, saying: “Good mother,\nthey’re all our enemies, since they’re plotting trouble for us;\nbut Antinoos is the worst, he’s like black death!\nSome luckless stranger’s been going round in the house\nbegging from all the men, driven to it by poverty.\nAll the rest gave him enough to fill his bag, but this man\nthrew a footstool and struck him, low down on his right shoulder.”\nSuch her words while she sat in her room, conversing\nwith her handmaids, and noble Odysseus was eating his scraps.\nThen she sent for the noble swineherd, and addressed him, saying:\n“Go now, noble Eumaios, invite this stranger here:\nI’d like to show him some kindness—and ask him if perhaps\nhe’s had has some news of steadfast-minded Odysseus,\nor has actually seen him: he seems to be widely traveled.”\nThen to her, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“Indeed, my queen, I could wish these Achaians would be silent,\nhe spins such a tale as would enchant your very soul!\nThree nights I had him with me, and three days I kept him\nin my hut—he first came to me after he jumped ship,\nbut that wasn’t the end of the tale of hardship he told me.\nLike the man gazing rapt at a minstrel performing lays that\nhe’s learned from the gods for the entrancement of mortals,\nwho are ceaselessly eager to hear him, whenever he sings—\nthat’s how this fellow charmed me as he sat in my home.\nHe says he’s a family guest-friend of Odysseus, and dwells\nin Krete, that place where the line of Minos holds sway.\nNow he’s come here from there, with much hardship on the way,\nwandering ever onward. He’s had news of Odysseus, he says:\nquite near, in the Thesprotians’ rich terrain, alive,\nand bringing much treasure back with him to his home.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Go, summon him! He can tell me all this, face to face.\nAs for these men sitting outside or here indoors, enjoying\na good time, let them go on, since that’s their fancy!\nTheir own possessions, bread and sweet wine, are left\nuntouched in their homes, and are eaten by their servants,\nwhile they themselves, day in day out, flock to our house,\nslaughter our cattle and sheep and fatted goats, hold feasts\nat which they swill down our bright red wine without\nany restraint. Most is gone now, for there is no man here\nsuch as Odysseus once was, to keep ruin from our house.\nBut were Odysseus to come back home, then he and his son\nwould at once exact vengeance for these men’s violent acts.”\nSo she spoke. Telemachos now sneezed, loudly. The whole\nhouse echoed ringingly round them. Penelope laughed,\nand at once addressed Eumaios with winged words, saying:\n“Please go now and bring the stranger here before me!\nDon’t you see how my son just sneezed at everything I said?\nIt follows that death shall not be unfulfilled for the suitors—\nto the last man: not one shall escape death and the fates.\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nIf I find that in all he relates he speaks only truth,\nthen I’ll dress him in mantle and tunic, the very best there are.”\nSo she spoke. The swineherd went, on hearing her words,\nto Odysseus, and addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“Stranger, father, prudent Penelope wants to see you—\nTelemachos’ mother: her heart bids her make enquiries\nabout her husband, although she’s suffered much already.\nIf she finds that in all you relate you speak only truth,\nthen she’ll dress you in mantle and tunic—things of which\nyou stand much in need! As for food, go beg through the land\nto keep your belly well fed: those who so choose will give.”\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“In a moment, Eumaios, I’ll be relating the whole truth\nto Ikarios’ daughter, the prudent Penelope! My knowledge\nof Odysseus is sound, and we’ve borne like hardships. But\nI’m much afraid of this crowd of dangerous suitors,\nwhose aggression and violence reach up to the iron heaven!\nFor just now, as I went through the hall, doing no harm,\nthis man struck me, causing much pain, yet neither\nTelemachos nor anyone else came out to protect me.\nSo tell Penelope she must wait in the halls, however\nimpatient she may be, until the sun goes down:\nthen let her ask me about the day of her husband’s return,\nand give me a seat that’s nearer the fire, since my clothes\nare threadbare. You know this yourself: I appealed to you first.”\nSo he spoke. The swineherd then, after hearing his words,\nwent back in. Penelope at once addressed him, saying:\n“You haven’t brought him, Eumaios! What’s this vagrant up to?\nIs he scared without reason of someone, or maybe embarrassed\nhere in the house? Embarrassment makes a useless beggar.”\nTo her then, swineherd Eumaios, you responded, saying:\n“What he says is well chosen, as anyone else would agree:\nhe hopes to avoid the violence of these arrogant men,\nso he wants you to wait to see him until the sun goes down.\nFor yourself too, my queen, it would indeed be far better\nto speak with the stranger, and hear what he says, alone.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“This stranger’s not witless: he figures how things may go.\nFor there may well be no other mortal men alive\nwho in their violence contrive such reckless acts as these.”\nSo she spoke, and the noble swineherd then departed\nand joined the throng of the suitors after he’d told her all.\nAt once he addressed winged words to Telemachos, head\nheld close, so that nobody else could hear him, saying:\n“Friend, I’m off out there now to guard the pigs and the rest—\nyour and my livelihood. You take charge of everything here.\nAbove all, keep yourself safe, take good care you don’t run\ninto trouble: many Achaians now have it in for you—\nmay Zeus destroy them utterly before harm can befall us!”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Old fellow, so it shall be. Off you go when you’ve had some food.\nBut come back tomorrow with fine sacrificial victims!\nAll here will be cared for by me. And by the immortals.”\nSo he spoke. The swineherd sat down again on a polished\nchair, and when he’d satisfied his desire for food and drink,\nhe went back to his pigs, leaving the courts and the hall\nfull of banqueters. Now they began to enjoy themselves with\ndancing and singing, for already the evening had arrived.\n",

         "\nNow there came up a public beggar, whose custom it was to beg\nthrough the town of Ithake, well known for his ravenous belly,\nforever guzzling and swilling. There was no strength in him,\nnor force; yet his great bulk made an imposing sight.\nHis name was Arnaios: this his lady mother had given him\nat birth. But Iros was his nickname with all the young men\nbecause he used to run errands for anyone who would ask him.\nUp he came now, bent on chasing Odysseus away\nfrom his own home, and began, with winged words, to upbraid him:\n“Out of this entrance, old man, before someone drags you off\nby the foot! Don’t you see how everyone’s winking at me,\nencouraging me to drag you? Yet I’m ashamed to do it.\nSo up with you now, or our quarrel will soon come to fisticuffs!”\nWith an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n“Sir, neither by words nor by action am I causing you harm,\nnor do I resent someone treating you—however large the helping!\nThis threshold has room for us both, nor is there need for you\nto be jealous of others. It seems to me you’re a vagrant\nas I am. Prosperity is something the gods will allot. But don’t\nprovoke me too much with your fists, lest you rouse my wrath,\nand, old man though I am, I spatter your breast and lips\nwith your blood! Then I’d enjoy much greater peace and quiet\ntomorrow, since I don’t think you’d then come back\na second time to the hall of Laertes’ son Odysseus.”\nNow Iros the vagrant grew angry, and addressed him, saying:\n“Oh my, how glibly this bald old pig rants on,\nlike some crone by the oven! But I’ll contrive trouble for him,\npunch him out with both hands, scatter all the teeth\nfrom his jaws on the ground, as I’d treat a crop-rooting sow!\nCome, gird yourself now, let all these men get to watch us\nfighting! Yet how could you ever stand up to a younger man?”\nSo these two, there in front of the lofty doorway\non the polished threshold were taunting each other sharply;\nAntinoos, princely in power, now noticed them at it,\nand, with a light laugh, addressed the suitors, saying:\n“Never before, my friends, has anything happened to match\nthe sport that some god’s brought to this house! The stranger\nand Iros are challenging one another to a fistfight!\nso gather round quickly, let’s make a real match of it!”\nSo he spoke. They all sprang to their feet, with laughter,\nand crowded about this couple of tatterdemalion beggars.\nAntinoos, son of Eupeithes, then addressed them, saying:\n“Listen, all you proud suitors, to what I have to say!\nThese goats’ paunches over the fire, set there for our supper,\nthat we filled first with fat and blood —let whichever of these two\nemerges victorious, proves himself the better man,\nstand up and take for himself the one that he chooses.\nWhat’s more, he shall always feast with us, nor will we allow\nany other beggar to join us or to beg among us.”\nSo Antinoos spoke: what he said was to their liking.\nThen with crafty intent resourceful Odysseus declared:\n“Friends, there’s no way an old man worn out by grief\ncan fight with a younger opponent; and yet my belly,\nthat worker of evil, urges me to succumb to his attacks!\nBut come now, all of you swear me a mighty oath\nthat no one, backing Iros, will strike me a foul blow\nin reckless mood, and use force to let this fellow beat me.”\nSo he spoke, and they all swore the oath as he requested.\nBut when they’d sworn, and completed the oath-taking, then\nTelemachos, princely in power, addressed them once more, saying:\n“Stranger, if your heart and proud spirit are urging you\nto beat off this man, have no fear of any other Achaian:\nany man who strikes you will be up against many more!\nI myself am your host, accepted by these two princes,\nAntinoos and Eurymachos, sagacious men both of them.”\nSo he spoke, and they all applauded. And now Odysseus\ngirded his rags about his loins, revealing his thighs,\nboth muscled and large, and his broad shoulders appeared,\nand his chest and his powerful forearms. Also Athene\ncame close and magnified the limbs of the people’s shepherd,\nso that even the suitors condescendingly admired them,\nand thus would one of them speak, with a glance at his neighbor:\n“Soon will Iros, un-Irosed, have a loss of his own making,\nso muscled a thigh does the old man reveal beneath his rags.”\nSo he spoke, and Iros’ spirit was severely shaken.\nYet even so the serving men made him gird up his rags\nand forced him out, terrified, the flesh shivering on his limbs.\nThen Antinoos addressed a scathing rebuke to him, saying:\n“Better for you, you braggart, had you never been born\nif you tremble in front of this man and are so afraid of him—\nsomeone so old, so broken by the hardship he’s suffered!\nI’ll tell you this straight out, and it’ll happen for sure:\nif he’s victorious, proves himself the better man,\nI’ll clap you in a black ship, send you off to the mainland,\nto King Echetos, dangerous maimer of all mortal men alive,\nwho’ll cut off your nose and ears with the pitiless bronze,\nand rip out your privates, give them raw to the dogs to eat.”\nSo he spoke, and yet greater trembling seized on Iros’ limbs\nas they led him out to the middle. Both men put up their hands.\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus was debating in his mind\nwhether to slam him so hard that life left him as he fell,\nor hit him just hard enough to stretch him out on the ground;\nand as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\nto hit him lightly, and not arouse Achaian suspicions.\nSo after they raised their hands Iros led to the right shoulder,\nbut Odysseus struck his neck beneath the ear. The blow\ncrushed in the bones. At once red blood filled his mouth,\nhe fell in the dust with a cry, and gnashed his teeth,\nand drummed on the ground with his feet. The lordly suitors,\narms raised, nearly died laughing. And then Odysseus\ndragged him out by his foot through the doorway to the courtyard\nand the gates of the colonnade. There he propped him sitting\nagainst the courtyard wall, thrust a staff into his hand,\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “Now sit there,\nto scare off the pigs and dogs! And stop pretending\nto lord it over strangers and beggars, you wretch,\nor you may well bring a yet worse disaster upon you!”\nWith that he slung over his shoulder his worn-out leather bag,\ntattered and rent, which was held by a twisted cord,\nand went back to the threshold and sat there. The suitors\ncame inside laughing gaily, and congratulated him, saying:\n“May Zeus and the other gods, stranger, grant you all\nthat you most desire, the dearest wish of your heart,\nfor you’ve ended the begging routine of this insatiable fellow\nin our neighborhood! Soon we’ll send him across to the mainland\nto King Echetos, dangerous maimer of all mortal men alive!”\nSo they spoke, and Odysseus rejoiced at the words of omen,\nand Antinoos set before him the great paunch, filled\nwith fat and blood, while Amphinomos chose two loaves,\ntook them out of the basket, and set these too before him,\nand pledged him, holding a golden cup, and addressed him, saying:\n“Your health, father and stranger: may prosperity hereafter\nattend you, though now you’re beset by many troubles.”\nTo him resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n“Amphinomos, you strike me as a highly sagacious man,\nsuch a one as your father was, whose reputation I knew of:\nDoulichian Nisos, a man both valiant and wealthy.\nThey say you’re his son: you seem a well-mannered person,\nso I’ve something to tell you: please listen and pay attention.\nThis earth nurtures nothing of less account than man\namong all creatures that breathe and move upon it;\nfor he thinks he’ll not suffer setbacks in the years ahead\nso long as the gods grant him prowess and his knees are nimble;\nand when the blessed gods bring him hard times, this too,\nthough against his will, he endures with a stubborn heart,\nfor the spirit of men on this earth will meet and match\nthe day that the Father of gods and men brings on them.\nI too was once on the way to a good life among my fellows,\nbut, yielding to strength and violence, did many reckless deeds,\nbecause I trusted my father and the rest of my kinsmen.\nSo no man should ever use lawlessness, on any occasion,\nbut accept in silence those gifts that the gods may give him.\nSuch reckless acts I now witness the suitors committing,\nas they squander the goods and show no respect for the wife\nof a man who, I tell you, won’t be absent much longer\nfrom his friends and country—he’s close! May some god rather\nlead you home out of here, so you don’t encounter him\nwhen he’s back in his native setting, for not bloodless, I think,\nwill be the final reckoning between that man and the suitors,\nonce he’s made it home and is under his own roof.”\nSo saying, he poured a libation, and drank the honey-sweet wine,\nand then returned the cup to the commander of the people.\nBut Amphinomos went through the hall deeply worried at heart,\nhead bowed, for his spirit clearly foresaw disaster.\nYet he still failed to dodge his fate, since Athene bound him\nto be violently overwhelmed by Telemachos’ hands and spear.\nNow he sat down again in the chair from which he’d risen.\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put a thought in the mind\nof Ikarios’ daughter, the prudent Penelope: that she\nshould appear now before the suitors, flutter their hearts\nto the utmost, and thus win still greater appreciation\nfrom her husband and son than they’d accorded her hitherto.\nWith an awkward laugh, she addressed her housekeeper, saying:\n“Eurynome, I’m now minded, as I’ve never been before,\nto show myself to the suitors, hateful though I still find them.\nAnd I want a word with my son, to tell him he’d do better\nnot to consort so much with these overweening suitors,\nwho treat him politely, but are plotting his downfall later.”\nThen Eurynome, housekeeper, responded to her, saying:\n“All this indeed, child, was well and properly spoken.\nGo now, have a word with your son, don’t hold it back!\nBut wash yourself first, and rub oil into your cheeks—\ndon’t go as you are, leaving your face all tear-stained:\navoid indiscriminate mourning, day in day out! Your son\nhas now attained the age that you begged the immortals most\nto allow you to see: he’s become a bearded adult.”\nTo her then prudent Penelope now responded, saying:\n“Eurynome, don’t, though you care for me, try to talk me\ninto washing my body or massaging myself with oil!\nAny beauty I once had the gods, who possess Olympos,\ndestroyed, from the day when he left with the hollow ships!\nBut go tell Autonoe now, along with Hippodameia,\nto come here: I want them beside me in the hall.\nI won’t go in to the men alone: I’d be ashamed to.”\nSo she spoke, and out through the hall the old woman went\nto take these handmaids the message, request their presence.\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another idea:\non Ikarios’ daughter she shed sweet sleep: she lay back\nand dozed, there in her recliner; all her joints were relaxed.\nWhile she slept, Athene, bright among goddesses, gave her\nambrosial gifts, to make her seem wondrous to the Achaians.\nTo begin with she cleansed her fine features with ambrosial\nbeauty, a salve such as that which fair-garlanded Kythereia\nemploys when she goes to join the Graces’ delightful dance;\nand she rendered her taller and fuller in appearance,\nand of whiter complexion than freshly sawn ivory. When\nshe’d done all this, she, the bright goddess, went on her way,\nand the white-armed handmaids then approached from the hall,\nchatting loudly, so that sweet sleep let Penelope go,\nand she sat up, rubbing her cheeks, and said to herself:\n“In the depth of my misery soft oblivion stilled my senses!\nHow I wish that chaste Artemis would give me so soft a death\nhere and now, that I might no longer with heartfelt lamentation\nwaste my life away, ever yearning for the unrivaled virtues\nof my dear husband, a man without peer among the Achaians.”\nSo saying, she went down from her bright upper chamber—\nnot alone, for the two handmaids followed in attendance.\nWhen she, bright among women, came where the suitors were,\nshe stood by the central post of the snugly timbered roof,\nholding up her shining veil in front of her face\nand flanked on either side by a devoted handmaid.\nAt once the men’s knees were weakened, their hearts inflamed\nby passion: each one of them prayed he might share her bed.\nBut she now addressed Telemachos, her dear son, saying:\n“Your mind-set and thinking, Telemachos, have got unbalanced!\nWhen you were still a child, you had more common sense!\nBut now you’re grown, and are on the verge of manhood—\nand outsiders, seeing only your stature and good looks,\nwould certainly think you the offspring of a successful man—\nyour mind and thinking no longer are on the proper track!\nLook at this business that just took place in our hall,\nthe way you let this stranger be so badly mistreated!\nAnd what if this same stranger, while sitting here in our house,\nwere to suffer real hurt from such grievous brutality? You\nwould then bear the burden of public shame and disgrace!”\nSagacious Telemachos now responded to her, saying:\n“My mother, I cannot reprove you for becoming angry:\nI myself now see and recognize all these things in my heart,\nboth the good and the worse, though before I thought as a child.\nYet I can’t work out everything with sagacity, because\nthey drive me crazy, these men sitting all around me\ncogitating their wicked schemes, while I have none to aid me.\nStill, the contest between the stranger and Iros didn’t go\nas the suitors expected: the stranger turned out a better fighter.\nHow I wish—by Zeus the Father, by Athene and Apollo!—\nthat these suitors were likewise now beaten, here in our home,\nheads lolling, some of them out there in the courtyard,\nothers inside the house, and the knees of all were unstrung,\nas now that lout Iros sits at the entrance to the courtyard,\nhead lolling, his appearance much like that of a drunk,\nunable to stand on his feet or to make his way home\nto wherever he lives, since his limbs are quite unstrung.”\nSuch was their conversation, the one with the other;\nand Eurymachos now addressed himself to Penelope, saying:\n“Ikarios’ daughter, most prudent Penelope: could all\nthe Achaians throughout Iasian Argos see you now,\nstill more suitors would be feasting here in your halls\nfrom early tomorrow, since you excel all other women\nin beauty and stature—and indeed in your sensible mind.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Eurymachos, any excellence of beauty and figure I had\nthe immortals destroyed at the time the Argives embarked\nfor Ilion, and among them went my husband, Odysseus.\nWere he only to come back now, and give comfort to my life,\ngreater would be my renown, and finer too; but now\nI grieve, so many sorrows has some god laid upon me.\nIndeed, when he was leaving his native land, did he not\nclasp my right hand at the wrist, and then address me, saying:\n‘My wife, since I don’t imagine that the well-greaved Achaians\nwill all return safe and unscathed from the land of Troy—\nfor the Trojans, they say, are most redoubtable warriors,\nas both spearmen and archers, and also as skillful charioteers\ndriving swift-footed horses, such men as can most quickly\ndecide who’ll win the great contest of leveling warfare—\nI don’t know whether the god will bring me back, or if\nI’ll die out at Troy: the care of all here must rest with you.\nLook after my mother and father at home as you do now,\nor with even closer attention, while I’m far away;\nbut if the day comes when you see our son grown and bearded,\nthen wed the man of your choice, and leave this house.’\n“So he spoke,\nand now all this is being brought about. A night\nwill come when some hateful marriage will be the lot\nof my unblest self, whom Zeus has deprived of comfort.\nBut in this matter sore grief has come on my heart and spirit,\nfor this was never the way that suitors wooed in the past,\nwhen men wanting to court a fine lady and rich man’s daughter\nwould all be in competition with one another, themselves\nbringing along fat flocks and cows to provide a banquet\nfor the bride’s friends and family, and giving her splendid gifts—\nnot devouring the substance of others, with no payment.”\nSo she spoke, and noble much-enduring Odysseus rejoiced\nbecause she coaxed gifts from these men, and charmed their hearts\nwith sweet words, while her mind was set on quite different things.\nThen Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, once more addressed her, saying:\n“Ikarios’ daughter, most prudent Penelope, presents—such as\nany one of the Achaians might bring for you here—you should\naccept, for it’s never polite to refuse a gift! But we\nshall depart neither back to our holdings nor anywhere else\nuntil you marry the man who’s the best of the Achaians.”\nSo Antinoos spoke. What he said was to their liking,\nand each man sent off a herald to fetch his presents.\nA large and exquisite robe was what came for Antinoos,\nfinely embroidered: attached to it were a dozen brooches,\nall of gold, and each fitted with smoothly rounded clasps.\nThere soon arrived for Eurymachos an elaborate golden\nchain, strung with amber beads, as bright as sunlight.\nEurydamas’ servants brought him a pair of earrings, with triple\nclustering pendants: much grace shone from them.\nFrom the house of the lord Peisandros, Polyktor’s son,\nhis servant now brought a necklace, an exquisite ornament.\nThus every Achaian provided some kind of lovely gift.\nBut she, bright among women, went back to her upper room,\nwhile her handmaids accepted these beautiful presents for her.\nThe men now turned their attention to the dance and delightful song\nfor their pleasure, awaiting the arrival of evening; and while\nthey were still enjoying themselves, dark evening came on.\nThen at once they set up three braziers in the hall\nto give them light, and piled seasoned firewood round them,\ndried out long since and sapless, newly split with the bronze,\nand set torches between them. The maids of steadfast-minded\nOdysseus took turns lighting them, and he himself, Zeus-born\nresourceful Odysseus, now spoke among them, saying:\n“You maidservants of Odysseus, your long-absent lord,\ngo back now up to the chamber where your revered queen is,\nply your distaffs beside her—and keep her cheerful while\nyou’re sitting there in her room—or card the wool\nwith your hands: I myself will make light for all these men,\nand even if they’re determined to stay up till well-throned Dawn\nthey won’t exhaust me, oh no: I’m a much-enduring fellow.”\nSo he spoke. But the handmaids tittered, and glanced at each other,\nand fair-cheeked Melantho reproved him in shameful wise—\nshe whom Dolios sired, but Penelope raised and cherished\nlike a daughter, and gave her all the toys she wanted.\nYet not even so did she share any part of Penelope’s sorrow,\nbut was having sex with Eurymachos, was his regular lover.\nShe now upbraided Odysseus in censorious language, saying:\n“You miserable stranger, you must be clean out of your mind!\nYou’re not willing to go get your sleep in a smithy, or some\npublic doss-house: oh no, you’re busy speaking so boldly,\namong all these gentlemen! Have you no proper respect?\nWine’s surely fuddled your wits, or else your mind’s\nalways like this, you’re forever spouting nonsense!\nAre you above yourself after beating that vagrant Iros?\nAnother man, better than Iros, may soon stand up against you,\nbeat you about the head with his powerful fists, befoul you\nwith streams of your own blood, and chase you from this house.”\nWith an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus retorted, saying:\n“You bitch, I’ll go straight to Telemachos, tell him the way\nyou talk! Very likely he’ll cut you up, there and then!”\nSo he spoke. His words sent the women scurrying off:\nAway they went through the hall, the limbs of each one loosened\nbeneath her by fear: they thought he’d do what he said.\nBut Odysseus stood by the flaming braziers, fed them,\none eye on the crowd of suitors, while in his mind he pondered\nother matters, not destined to go without fulfillment.\nBut these haughty suitors Athene would not permit at all\nto back off from distressing outrage: she wanted its pain to sink\ndeeper still into the heart of Laertes’ son Odysseus.\nNow Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, began to address them,\nmaking fun of Odysseus, arousing laughter in his comrades:\n“Listen to me, all you suitors of our glorious queen, while I\nsay what the heart in my breast impels me to tell you!\nNot without the gods’ will has this man reached Odysseus’ home!\nThe torchlight does indeed appear to emanate from him—\nfrom his head, that is, which lacks the least trace of hair upon it.”\nWith that he addressed Odysseus, the city-sacker, saying:\n“Would you come and work for me, stranger, as a hired day-laborer,\non my outlying estate—your pay would be adequate—\ncollecting stones for the field walls, and planting tall trees?\nI’d provide you there with food the entire year through,\nand keep you well clothed, and give you shoes for your feet.\nBut since all you’ve learnt are bad habits, you won’t want\nto set yourself to hard work; no, you’d rather beg your way\nthrough the district, to keep your insatiate belly fed.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Eurymachos, how I wish we two might have a contest\nin the season of spring, when the days are growing longer,\nout in the meadow, and I had a well-curved scythe in my hands,\nand you another one like it, for us to make trial of our work,\ngoing without food until evening, and the grass was thick!\nOr again, I wish we had teams of oxen to drive—the best,\nbig and tawny, both well fed on grass, both of an age,\nboth equal in drawing power, and of no slight strength—\nin a four-acre field, the clods yielding to the plowshare:\nthen you’d see whether I could keep my furrows straight!\nOr again, if the son of Kronos from somewhere brought an attack\nupon us today, and I had a shield and two spears\nand a helmet made all of bronze, snug against my temples,\nthen you’d see me out there among the foremost fighters,\nand wouldn’t abuse me in speeches because of my belly!\nBut you’re so incredibly arrogant and rigid-minded—\nI suppose you think you’re a great and powerful fellow\nbecause those you consort with are mean and common?\nIf only Odysseus might come, and return to his own country,\nthen at once these doors, however wide, would be\nall too narrow for your flight out through the entrance!”\nSo he spoke. Eurymachos flared up in wrath, stared at him\nwith an angry glance, then addressed him with winged words, saying:\n“You wretch, I’ll soon punish you for the way you have of speaking\nso boldly, among all these gentlemen! Have you no proper respect?\nWine’s surely fuddled your wits, or else your mind’s\nalways like this, you’re forever spouting nonsense!\nAre you above yourself after beating that vagrant Iros?”\nSo saying, he snatched up a footstool; but Odysseus\nducked down at Doulichian Amphinomos’ knees in reaction to\nEurymachos, whose throw instead hit the wine bearer’s\nright hand, so that his pitcher fell to the ground with a clang,\nwhile he himself groaned, collapsed backward in the dust.\nThe suitors now burst into uproar throughout the shadowy halls,\nand thus would one of them speak, with a glance at his neighbor:\n“I wish this stranger had died somewhere else in his wanderings\nbefore he came here! Then he’d never have raised such a tumult!\nBut now we’re at odds over beggars, there’ll be no pleasure\nin our privileged feasting, since meaner ways prevail.”\nTelemachos, princely in power, also addressed them, saying:\n“Foolish sirs, you are crazy! You no longer hide the effects\nof your swilling and guzzling—some god must be stirring you up!\nYou’ve feasted well: go home now, lie down and rest—of course\nwhen the mood takes you: I chase no person away!”\nSo he spoke. Every one of them bit his lip and marveled\nat Telemachos because of his bold outspoken manner.\nBut Amphinomos, illustrious son of Nisos, the lord\nAretias’ son, now addressed them, saying: “Friends,\nin response to what has been fairly and justly spoken\nno man should take offense, make a hostile retort!\nDo not abuse this stranger, or any one of the servants\nnow domiciled in the household of godlike Odysseus!\nNo, rather let’s have the wine bearer pour drops in our cups\nso we can make libations, and then go home to rest,\nleaving the stranger behind here in the halls of Odysseus\nfor Telemachos to look after: it’s to his house that he’s come.”\nSo he spoke: what he said was acceptable to them all.\nThen a bowl was mixed up for them by the hero Moulios\nfrom Doulichion, a herald and the squire of Amphinomos.\nHe gave it to all in due order: they made libations\nto the blessed gods, and drank the honey-sweet wine.\nThen, libations made, when they’d drunk all they’d a mind to,\nthey all departed to rest, each man to his own home.\n",

         "\nSo noble Odysseus was left behind, there in the hall,\nwith Athene’s aid contriving a plan to kill the suitors;\nand now he addressed Telemachos with winged words, saying:\n“Telemachos, we must lay up all our weapons of war inside\nand disarm the suitors with soothing words when they note\ntheir absence and ask you questions about them. Say:\n‘I stored them away from the smoke, since they no longer look\nas they did when Odysseus left them on going off to Troy,\nbut are blackened with all the fire’s breath that’s got to them.\nAnd there’s a greater concern some god has put in my mind:\nthat when you’re flushed with wine you may pick a quarrel\namong you and wound one another and so disgrace\nyour feast and your wooing: for iron of itself attracts a man.’”\nSo he spoke. Telemachos obeyed his own dear father,\nand summoned his nurse Eurykleia, and addressed her, saying:\n“Good mother, please keep the women confined to their quarters\nwhile I put away in the storeroom the weapons of my father—\nfine gear, left in the house uncared for, blackened with smoke\never since my father’s departure, when I was still a child.\nBut now I want to store them out of reach of the fire’s breath.”\nHis dear nurse Eurykleia responded to him, saying:\n“Indeed, child, I could wish you were always so concerned\nto take care of the house and to guard the possessions in it!\nBut who, pray, will go get a light and carry it for you?\nThe maidservants would have done it, but you won’t let them.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“This stranger here; for I’ll permit no man to be idle\nwho gets my rations, however remote the place he’s from.”\nSo he spoke; but her answer remained unwinged,\nand she barred the doors of the pleasantly sited halls.\nOdysseus and his illustrious son now both set to work\ncarrying in the helmets and the embossed shields,\nthe sharp-pointed spears; and before them Pallas Athene\nwent holding a golden lamp that made resplendent light.\nAt once Telemachos spoke, and addressed his father, saying:\n“Father, here’s a great wonder that my eyes behold!\nReally, the walls of the hall and its elegant panels,\nthe roof beams of fir and the tall posts holding them up\nare glowing bright to my eyes, like a blazing fire!\nSurely some god’s in here, one of those who hold wide heaven.”\nResourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Hush! Keep this to yourself, and ask no questions!\nThis is indeed the way of the gods who hold Olympos.\nYou go get your rest now: I shall stay here and provoke\nmore interest yet in the handmaids and your mother—\nshe’ll weep, and question me about every detail.”\nSo he spoke, and Telemachos now went out through the hall,\nlit by the flaring torches, to bed down in his room,\nwhere he always retired when sweet sleep came upon him.\nNow once more he lay down there, to await the bright Dawn,\nwhile noble Odysseus was left behind, there in the hall,\nwith Athene’s aid contriving a plan to kill the suitors.\nNow prudent Penelope came down from her chamber,\nin appearance like Artemis or golden Aphrodite,\nand for her they set a chair by the fire, where she always sat,\ninlaid with spirals of silver and ivory: this was the work\nof the craftsman Ikmalios, who’d fashioned a stool for the feet\nthat was part of the chair itself. A great fleece was spread on it.\nOn this, then, prudent Penelope sat, while her white-armed\nhandmaids came in from the women’s hall, and began\nto remove all the leftover food, as well as the tables,\nand the cups from which these haughty men had been drinking;\nthey threw out the ash from the braziers, heaped them up\nwith fresh firewood, to provide both light and warmth. And now\nMelantho began once again to scold Odysseus, saying:\n“Stranger, are you still here? Are you going to annoy us\nall night, prowling round the house, spying on the women?\nGet out of here, you wretch, be content with your supper,\nor you’ll soon be thrown out, and beaten with firebrands too!”\nWith an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded:\n“Woman, why reprimand me in so resentful a spirit?\nIs it because I’m dirty and wear mean clothes and go\nbegging my way through the neighborhood? It’s need compels me.\nThat’s the way it is with beggars and vagabonds!\nYet I too once dwelt in my own rich house among other\nprosperous men, and I often would give to a vagrant,\nno matter what sort he was or what he arrived in need of!\nCountless servants I had, and much else in abundance,\nowning which men live well and are known as wealthy.\nBut Kronos’ son Zeus wrecked it all—on some whim, I guess.\nSo take good care, woman, lest one day you lose all\nthat beauty for which you stand out among the handmaids,\nlest your mistress may come to dislike you, and treat you harshly,\nor Odysseus may return—there’s still hope! But even if\nhe’s actually dead, and will nevermore come back home,\nyet already, thanks to Apollo, his son’s such a man as himself—\nTelemachos! He doesn’t miss it if one of the serving women\nin the hall misbehaves—he’s no longer the child he was.”\nSo he spoke, and prudent Penelope heard what he said,\nand rebuked the maidservant, addressed her directly, saying:\n“Bold woman, impudent bitch, none of your gross misconduct\nhas escaped me—on your own head you’ll wipe it off!\nWell did you know, since it was from me you heard it,\nthat I wanted to question the stranger here in my halls\nabout my husband, for whom my grief is great and ceaseless.”\nWith that she also addressed the housekeeper Eurynome, saying:\n‘‘Eurynome, bring a chair here, and spread a fleece upon it,\nso the stranger may sit down now and tell me his story\nand also listen to me: I’m eager to question him.”\nSo he spoke, and Eurynome at once went off and fetched\na polished chair, and threw a fleece over it. Then\nmuch-enduring noble Odysseus seated himself, and prudent\nPenelope was the first to start their discussion, saying:\n“Stranger, I shall begin by asking you this question:\nWho are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?”\nTo her then resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n“Lady, no mortal on this boundless earth could ever\nfind fault with you: your fame goes up to the wide heaven,\nlike that of some king, a blameless, god-fearing person\nwho reigns over many valiant men, and upholds\njustice: one for whom the black soil bears in abundance\nboth wheat and barley, the trees are heavy with fruit,\nthe flocks bring forth young in season, the sea yields fish,\nall from his good leadership, and his people thrive under him.\nSo question me here in your house about anything else,\nbut don’t ask me about my background or my native country,\nlest you fill my heart with yet more suffering as I\nrecall them; for I’m a man of deep grief. What’s more,\nit’s not right that I should sit in someone else’s house\nweeping and wailing: such uncurbed sorrow’s a bad thing.\nI don’t want one of your handmaids, much less you yourself,\nsaying I swim in tears since my mind’s deep-sodden with wine.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Stranger, any excellence of beauty and figure I had\nthe immortals destroyed at the time the Argives embarked\nfor Ilion, and among them went my husband, Odysseus.\nWere he only to come back now, and give comfort to my life,\ngreater would be my renown, and finer too; but now\nI grieve, so many sorrows has some god laid upon me.\nAll the highborn leaders who lord it over the islands—\nDoulichion and Same and forested Zakynthos,\nbesides those who rule as princes in rugged Ithake—\nall court me against my will, and squander my property.\nAnd so I pay no attention to strangers and suppliants,\nor to heralds at all, who indeed are public officials,\nbut waste my own heart away in yearning for Odysseus.\nSo these men urge my remarriage, while I spin my deceits.\nFirst, some god put in my mind the idea of a great web\nin my halls: so I set up a big loom, and started weaving—\nbroad was the web, fine of thread—then addressed them, saying:\n‘You young men, my suitors now noble Odysseus is dead,\nbe patient, though eager to wed me, until I finish\nthis web: I should not want my woven work to be wasted—\na shroud for the hero Laertes, against that day\nwhen the grim fate of pitiless death shall overtake him:\nthen the local Achaian women won’t be able to blame me\nfor a man who’d won so much being left with no winding-sheet.’\n“So I spoke; and the manly spirit was persuaded within them.\nFrom then on, day after day, I’d weave at the great loom,\nbut at night I’d have torches set up, and undo my work.\n“Thus for three years I convinced, and deceived, the Achaians;\nbut when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round,\nand the months wore away, and day after day passed by,\nthen it was that, told by my handmaids, the uncaring bitches,\nthey stole up on me and caught me, reproached me loudly.\nSo against my will I was made to finish the job, perforce;\nand now I can neither avoid this marriage, nor find\nany other way of escape. My parents keep urging me\nto get wed, my son frets as these men consume our estate—\nsomething he understands, for now he’s a man, well able\nto look after a household to which Zeus still grants honor!\nYet even so tell me your family, where you come from—\nyou’re not sprung from the oak of legend, nor from a rock!”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,\nwill you never quit questioning me about my background?\nI’ll tell you, then; though you’ll give me over to yet more\ngriefs than I have already—but that’s the way of it,\nwhen a man’s been absent from home as long as I have,\na vagrant who’s suffered much on the road from city to city.\nNevertheless I’ll answer your questions and enquiries!\nThere’s a country called Krete out in the wine-dark deep,\nfine, rich-soiled, and sea-girt; it has in it many people,\nso many they’re countless: they have ninety cities,\nand various tongues, one mixed with another—Achaians,\nproud native Kretans, Kydonians, all are established there,\nwith Dorians in three settlements, and noble Pelasgians too!\nAmong their townships is Knosos, a great city, in which Minos\nruled from the age of nine, held converse with great Zeus,\nand was father to my father, great-hearted Deukalion.\nDeukalion sired both me and the lordly Idomeneus,\nwho’d set out for Ilion in his curved ships along with\nthe sons of Atreus. My own famous name is Aithon;\nI was the younger by birth, he my elder and better.\nIt was there I met Odysseus, gave him a guest-friend’s gifts,\nfor a gale-force wind had brought him too to Krete\nas he made for Troy, driving him off course past Malea.\nSo he put in to Amnisos, site of the cave of Eileithyia,\nin a difficult harbor, having barely escaped the storm.\nHe went up to the city at once, and asked for Idomeneus,\nclaiming to be his dear and respected guest-friend; but\nit was ten or eleven days since Idomeneus had gone,\nsailing away with his curved ships to Ilion. So I\nescorted him to our house, and welcomed him properly,\nwith full entertainment from our rich household store;\nand for the rest of the comrades who were with him I obtained\nfrom public reserves both barley and bright red wine,\nand sacrificial cattle, to keep them well satisfied.\nThere for twelve days the noble Achaians were delayed\nby a north wind so powerful it wouldn’t even let them stand\nupright: I suppose some maleficent deity roused it.\nBut on the thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they put to sea.”\nThus he told many lies, but made them seem like the truth,\nand her tears flowed as she listened, her stubborn heart melted.\nAs snow will melt on a high mountain’s ramparts, where\nthe east wind thaws the snow that a west wind has sent down,\nand, melting, it brims the fast-flowing rivers—just so\nher fine cheeks streamed with the tears she shed as she wept\nfor the husband sitting beside her. But though Odysseus\npitied his sobbing wife in his heart, yet nevertheless\nhis eyes—as though made of horn or iron—remained\nunwavering under their lids. Deceptively he concealed\nhis own tears. When she’d had her fill of tearful lamentation,\nonce more she responded to him, saying: “Now I think\nI need to make trial of you, stranger, and discover\nwhether you and your godlike comrades did in fact\nentertain my husband at home, the way you claim!\nTell me, what clothes was he wearing, what kind of person\nwas he himself, which companions did he have with him?”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n“Lady, it’s hard for one who’s been so long abroad\nto say for sure: it’s now the twentieth year since he\ndeparted thence, leaving my native country! However,\nI’ll tell you how my memory pictures him today:\nnoble Odysseus had on a woolen cloak, purple in color,\nand double-folded, its fibula fashioned of gold,\nwith twin pin-sheaths. On its front was delicately incised\na hound with a dappled fawn gripped in its forepaws,\nwatching it writhe: and everyone thought it marvelous\nhow the dog, though of gold, eyed the fawn it was throttling,\nwhile the fawn’s feet were struggling in its efforts to escape.\nI noted the tunic he wore, too—it shone all over,\nlike the sheen you see on the skin of a dried onion,\nso soft and sheer it was, and as bright as sunlight,\nand many indeed were the women who marveled at it.\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nI don’t know whether Odysseus wore such clothes at home,\nor if some comrade gave him them on boarding that swift ship,\nor a stranger perhaps, since to many Odysseus was\na good friend, and few Achaians could be called his equal.\nI gave him a bronze sword myself and a double-folded\ncloak—a fine purple one—and a tunic with a fringe,\nand saw him off properly in his well-benched vessel.\nAnd there was a herald with him, a slightly older man—\nLet me describe him to you, as I recall he looked—\nround-shouldered, dark of complexion, with curly hair,\nand his name was Eurybates. Odysseus respected him more\nthan his other companions: they were a like-minded pair.”\nSo he spoke, and stirred in her heart yet more the urge to weep,\nsince she recognized the sure signs that Odysseus had told her.\nBut when she had had her fill of tearful lamentation,\nshe then responded to him, saying: “Hitherto, stranger,\nyou’ve earned our pity; but from this time on in my halls\nyou’ll receive the treatment that’s kept for an honored friend!\nI myself gave him those clothes, just as you describe them,\nfrom the storeroom, folded them, attached that bright brooch\nas an ornament for him! But himself I’ll never welcome\nreturning back home to his own beloved country:\nan ill-fated day it was, then, when Odysseus set out\nin his hollow ship to ill Ilion—that unspeakable name!”\nTo her then resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,\nno longer mar your fair flesh, nor waste away your heart\nin mourning your husband—though I cannot blame you:\nfor any woman will weep when she’s lost her wedded\nhusband, to whom she’s borne children, conceived in love,\nthough he’ll not be an Odysseus, who they say was like\nthe gods. Now stop your crying, and attend to my words,\nfor I’m going to tell you the truth, and hold back nothing.\nI recently heard news concerning Odysseus’ return—\nthat he’s near, in the rich country of the Thesprotians,\nstill alive, and bringing with him much splendid treasure,\ncollecting it through the region. But his trusty companions\nhe lost, with his hollow ship, on the wine-dark deep\non his way from the isle of Thrinakie, for Zeus and Helios\nmade him suffer because his comrades had slaughtered Helios’ cattle.\nSo they all perished in the surging deep; but him,\nastride his ship’s keel, the waves then cast ashore\nin the country of the Phaiakians, who are kin to the gods.\nThese treated him like a god, paid him heartfelt honors,\ngave him many gifts, and were themselves quite willing\nto escort him home unscathed. Odysseus would have been\nback here long since, had he not thought it more gainful\nto amass a great deal of wealth by wide world travel:\nfor Odysseus excels all mortals in his knowledge of ways\nto profit, a field in which no other man could match him.\nKing Pheidon of the Thesprotians told me as much. Moreover\nhe told me on oath, while pouring libations at home,\nthat the ship had been launched, and the crew were in readiness\nto convey him to his own country. But me he sent off first,\nsince there chanced to be a Thesprotian vessel ready\nto sail for Doulichion, that country rich in wheat.\nAnd he showed me all the possessions Odysseus had amassed—\nenough to support his descendants to the tenth generation\nwere the treasures stored for him there in the king’s domain!\nBut Odysseus, he said, had gone to Dodone, to discover\nfrom the deep-leaved sacred oak what Zeus was planning\nand how he should make his way back to Ithake’s rich land\nafter so long an absence, whether openly or in secret.\nThus, as I say, he is safe, he’ll be here at any moment:\nhe’s very near now, not much longer will he be absent\nfrom his friends and his country! I’ll give you my sworn word:\nZeus first, highest and best of gods, be my witness,\nand the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\nthat all these things indeed will come to pass as I tell you!\nWithin the current moon’s sequence Odysseus will arrive here,\nbetween this month’s waning and the rising of the next.”\nPrudent Penelope then responded to him, saying:\n“Would that these words of yours, stranger, might be fulfilled!\nThen you’d soon know both friendship and gifts in plenty\nfrom me—any man who met you would call you blessed!\nBut this is how, in my heart, I think it will be: Odysseus\nwill nevermore come home, nor will you obtain\nconveyance—there are no longer such masters in this house\nas Odysseus was among men—if he ever existed—\nto welcome respected strangers or escort them on their way.\nNevertheless, my handmaids, bathe him, make his bed\nwith bedding and coverlets and bright-colored blankets, so he’s\nwarm until he comes through to Dawn the golden-throned.\nThen early tomorrow bathe him and rub him with oil,\nso that in here beside Telemachos he may sharpen his appetite\nas he sits in the hall. It will be the worse for any of these\nmen who rudely annoys him: such a man will have no future\nhere from now on, no matter how angrily he reacts!\nFor how will you learn about me, stranger, whether I\nreally excel other women in mind and prudent counsel\nif you sit down to a meal in my hall unwashed\nand in threadbare clothes? Men’s span of life is brief.\nWhoever is harsh himself, whose mind knows harshness,\non him all mortals invoke disaster for the future\nwhile he lives, and the whole world mocks him once he’s dead.\nBut whoever is blameless himself, and has blameless thoughts,\nstrangers will spread his renown both far and wide\namong all mankind, and many will praise his nobility.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,\ncoverlets and bright-colored blankets have been hateful\nto me ever since I left Krete’s snow-clad mountains\nbehind me, and sailed away in my long-oared ship.\nI shall bed down as I’ve done on other sleepless nights:\nmany the nights I’ve spent on some wretched resting place,\nlying there waiting for the brightly enthroned Dawn!\nNor does the washing of feet bring solace of any kind\nto my heart: there isn’t a woman that shall touch my feet\nof all the servants you have here in this house—unless\nthere’s maybe some aged woman, with a devoted heart,\nwho’s suffered as much in her spirit as I have myself:\nI wouldn’t have any objection to her handling my feet.”\nOnce more prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Dear guest, never yet, of the strangers from distant places,\nhas a man so sagacious been more welcome in my home—\nso well-phrased and responsible is everything you say!\nI do have one such old woman, very sensible-minded,\nwho nursed and cared for that unfortunate man,\ncradled him in her arms the day his mother bore him.\nIt’s she who shall wash your feet, enfeebled though she is.\nCome on, up with you now, my prudent Eurykleia,\nand wash one of an age with your master: Odysseus, I’m sure,\nmust by now have just such feet and just such hands,\nfor too soon does the stress of ill-fortune age us mortals.”\nSo she spoke: the old woman hid her face in her hands,\nshed hot tears, then uttered words of lamentation, saying:\n“Alas, child, for you I am helpless. Zeus must have hated you—\ndevout heart though you had—beyond all other men.\nNever yet to Zeus, hurler of thunderbolts, did a mortal\nburn so many fat thighs, such splendid arrays of oxen\nas you offered up, with prayers that you might achieve\na sleek old age and rear your illustrious son. But now\nyou alone he’s wholly deprived of a day of homecoming!\nHe too, I imagine, was jeered at by the women\nof far-distant strangers, when he came to some house of renown,\njust as these bitches here all together are making fun of you,\nand it’s to avoid their mistreatment and endless insults\nthat you won’t let them wash you; so it’s me, nothing loath, to whom\nIkarios’ prudent daughter Penelope’s given the job.\nSo I’ll wash your feet, for both Penelope’s sake and yours,\nsince the heart in my breast is stirred by sorrow. But now\ntake good note of what I’m about to say to you:\nMany a travel-worn stranger’s made his way here, but none,\nI tell you, have I yet seen who bore so close a resemblance\nas you do—voice, build, and gait—to Odysseus himself.”\nTo her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n“Old dame, that’s what everyone says who’s seen us both:\nthat we resemble each other closely—a likeness\nthat you too now have noticed, and remarked on.”\nSo he spoke.\nThe old woman took the bright cauldron, and prepared\nto wash him. She first poured out a lot of cold water,\nthen added some hot. But Odysseus sat down by the hearth,\nand at once turned away toward the darker side, because\nhe’d suddenly realized that when she was handling him\nshe would notice the scar, and the truth would be revealed.\nAnd indeed, as she settled in close to wash her lord, she did\nat once know the scar, of a wound that a boar’s white tusk\nhad made when he went to Parnassos, to Autolykos and his sons—\nhis mother’s noble father, who outstripped all mankind\nin thieving and artful oaths, a talent bestowed by a god—\nHermes, to whom he burned acceptable thigh pieces\nof lambs and kids, and so was quite ready to protect him.\nNow Autolykos paid a visit to the rich land of Ithake,\nwhere he found the son of his daughter, recently born,\nand Eurykleia placed the baby on his knees at the moment he\nwas finishing supper, then spoke, and addressed him, saying:\n“Autolykos, up to you now to find a name to bestow on\nyour own child’s dear child: he has been much prayed for.” To her\nAutolykos then responded, saying: “My daughter’s husband,\nand you, my daughter, give him the name I shall tell you.\nSince I come here as one who’s dealt pain and grief to many,\nmen and women alike, over the fruitful earth,\nlet his name be Odysseus; and I, for my part, when he\ncomes as a grown man to the great house on Parnassos\nof his mother’s family, where I keep my possessions,\nwill give him his share, and send him back rejoicing.”\nThis was what Odysseus had come for, to get his splendid gifts.\nAutolykos greeted him, and the sons of Autolykos too,\nwith handshakes and expressions of cordial welcome,\nand his mother’s mother, Amphithee, embraced Odysseus,\nand kissed his head and both of his beautiful eyes,\nand Autolykos gave the word to his illustrious sons\nto get dinner ready, and they responded to his call.\nAt once they brought in a male ox, five years old,\nflayed it, dressed it, butchered the whole carcass,\nexpertly cut up the pieces and threaded them on spits,\nroasted these carefully and then shared out the portions.\nSo all day long until the hour when the sun went down\nthey feasted, and no one lacked his fair share of the meal.\nBut after the hour of sunset, when darkness came on,\nthen they retired to rest, and embraced the gift of sleep.\nWhen Dawn appeared, early risen and rosy-fingered,\nthey sallied forth on the hunt, both the dogs and the sons\nof Autolykos: and along with them noble Odysseus\nwent too. Up the steep slopes of the forest-clad mountain\nParnassos they climbed, and soon reached its windy ravines.\nThe sun was just striking the fields below on its way\nup from the peaceful and deep-flowing stream of Ocean\nwhen the hunters came to a forest glen. Ahead of them went\nthe dogs, pursuing a scent, and close behind them\nAutolykos’ sons, among them noble Odysseus, hard on\nthe heels of the dogs, and brandishing his far-shadowing spear.\nThere, in a dense thicket, was crouched a huge wild boar.\nThe damp force of driving winds could not penetrate its lair,\nnor the sun with its gleaming rays shine into it, nor the rain\npierce right through its protection, so thick it was; and the drifts\nof fallen leaves had piled up in their abundance round it.\nNow the boar heard the sound of footfalls, from men and dogs\npressing on in the hunt, and out from his lair he came\nto face them, back all abristle, fire glinting from his eyes,\nand stood close at bay. Then, first of them all, Odysseus\nsprang forward, long spear raised high in his stout hand,\nready to strike; but the boar beat him to it, gored him\nabove the knee, tore with his tusk a long gash in the flesh,\nattacking him slantwise, but failed to reach his leg-bone;\nand Odysseus struck him squarely in the right shoulder,\nso that the bright spear’s point now drove clean through.\nThe boar gasped, and fell in the dust, and the life fled from him.\nAutolykos’ sons then busied themselves with the carcass,\nand the wound that blameless godlike Odysseus had suffered\nthey skillfully bandaged, and stanched the flow of dark blood\nwith a charm, then went straight back to their father’s house.\nSo Autolykos, and the sons of Autolykos, healed him\nfully and well, handed over his splendid gifts, and then\nsoon sent him back rejoicing to his native country,\nto Ithake; and there his father and lady mother\nwelcomed him home with pleasure, asked detailed questions\nabout how he came to be wounded; he told them the way\nthe boar’s white tusk had gored him when he was out hunting\nup on Parnassos, together with the sons of Autolykos.\nThis scar the old woman recognized when she felt it\nin the palms of her hands, and she dropped his leg. It fell\nshin first into the basin, with a clatter of bronze:\nthe basin tipped over, the water spilled out on the floor,\nas joy and grief together invaded her heart, her eyes\nfilled with tears, and her voice stuck in her throat.\nHer hand reached out to touch Odysseus’ chin, she gasped:\n“It’s you, Odysseus, dear child, and I didn’t know you\nuntil I’d handled the rest of my master’s person!”\nWith that she turned her glance in Penelope’s direction,\nwanting to show her that her dear husband was there,\nbut Athene distracted Penelope’s mind, so she could neither\nmeet her eye nor guess at her meaning. As for Odysseus,\nhe felt for Eurykleia’s throat with his right hand, seized it,\nwith the other drew her close to him, and whispered, saying:\n“Old nurse, are you trying to kill me? You yourself suckled me\nat your own breast! And now, after suffering much,\nI’ve come, in the twentieth year, back to my own country!\nBut since you’ve hit on the truth, and a god’s alerted you,\nhush now, don’t let anyone else in the house find out!\nFor if you do, this I tell you, and it shall come to pass:\nshould some god let me put down these lordly suitors,\nI shall not spare you, my nurse though you were, when I slay\nthose other serving women, here in my halls.”\nThen prudent\nEurykleia responded to him, saying: “My child,\nwhat’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth?\nYou know how firm my strength is, how unyielding—\nI shall keep your secret as close as hard stone or iron!\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nIf some god lets you put down these lordly suitors,\nthen I’ll report to you on the women in your halls,\nwhich ones dishonor you, and which remain innocent.”\nTo her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n“Old mother, why tell me of them? There’s no need! I myself\nshall take good note and discover the truth about each one.\nNo, just keep my secret, and leave the rest to the gods.”\nSo he spoke. The old woman went off through the hall to fetch\nfresh foot-washing water, for the first lot was all spilt;\nand when she’d washed him, and rubbed him well with oil,\nOdysseus once more drew his chair back nearer the fire\nto warm himself, and concealed the scar beneath his rags.\nThen prudent Penelope started their conversation, saying:\n“Stranger, there’s one small thing I still must ask you,\nsince soon it will be the time for pleasant repose—at least,\nfor him whom sweet sleep possesses despite his cares!\nBut to me some deity’s brought a sorrow that’s measureless:\nby day I find my pleasure in mourning and lamentation,\nwhile I look to my household tasks, and those of my women;\nbut when night comes, and sleep catches everybody else,\nI lie on my bed, and around my throbbing heart\nsharp cares come crowding, to disquiet me as I lament.\nJust as Pandareus’ daughter, the greenwood nightingale,\nat the fresh onset of spring sings sweetly, sitting\nperched amid the thick foliage of the trees, and with\nclose variant trills pours forth her rippling song, a dirge\nlamenting her dear son Itylos, the son of King Zethos,\nwhom once with the bronze she slew unwittingly—even so\nmy heart’s torn in two directions, this way and that:\nshould I stay here with my son, keep everything unchanged—\nproperty, serving women, this large and high-roofed house—\nrespecting the bed of my husband and public opinion?\nOr should I now wed whoever’s the best of the Achaians\ncourting me here in my halls, bringing me countless gifts?\nSo long as my son was thinking and behaving as a child,\nhe wouldn’t let me abandon my husband’s house to remarry;\nbut now he’s full-grown and has come to manhood’s stature\nhe even begs me to go back home, so concerned he’s become\nfor his patrimony, which these Achaians are eating up.\n“But come, hear this dream of mine, and interpret it for me:\nI had twenty geese round the house, they came up from the water\nand I fed them on wheat: the sight of them warmed my heart.\nBut down from the mountain swooped a great eagle, with curved beak,\nbroke all their necks and killed them. They lay scattered\nall over the hall, while the eagle soared up in the bright sky.\nI wept and wailed, although it was only a dream,\nand the fine-tressed Achaian women gathered around me\nas I grieved sadly because the eagle had killed my geese.\nBut then back it came, perched on a jutting rafter,\nand with the voice of a human caught me short, declaring:\n‘Take heart, you daughter of far-famed Ikarios: this\nis no dream, but a true vision, that will surely be fulfilled!\nThese geese are the suitors, and I, who before was a bird,\nthe eagle, have now at last come back as your husband,\nwho’ll unleash a grim fate on all the suitors.’\nSo he spoke.\nThen honey-sweet sleep released its hold upon me,\nand glancing around I saw the geese in my domain\npecking up grain by the trough, as they’d done previously.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“Madam, no way is it possible, by twisting its clear meaning,\nto interpret this dream any other way, since Odysseus himself\nhas shown you how he’ll fulfill it! The doom of all the suitors\nis clear! Not one of them will escape death and the fates!”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Stranger, dreams are hard to make sense of or interpret,\nand not all of them reach fulfillment for us mortals.\nFor there are two gateways set up for fleeting dreams,\nof which one is constructed from horn, the other from ivory.\nThose dreams that come through the gate of sawn ivory\nare deceptive, bringing words that remain unfulfilled;\nbut those that emerge from the gate of polished horn\npresage the truth for anyone who beholds them. But for me\nit was not, I think, from there that my own strange dream\ncame—welcome though that would have been to me and my son!\nAnd another thing I will tell you, and you take it to heart:\nThe ill-starred day is approaching that’s to remove me\nfrom the house of Odysseus: for now I shall order a contest—\nthose axes that he used to set up here in his halls\nin a straight line, like ships’ props, twelve of them all told—\nhe’d stand at a distance, and shoot an arrow through them.\nSo now I shall order this contest for the suitors:\nwhoever, handling his bow, shall string it most easily\nand then shoot an arrow clear through all twelve axes,\nwith him I’d depart, leaving this house to which I came\nas a wedded wife—a fine home, and full of rich possessions!\nI think I shall always remember it, even in my dreams.”\nTo her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n“Respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,\ndo not any longer delay this contest in your house,\nfor resourceful Odysseus will arrive here before that—\nbefore these fellows can get to handle the polished bow,\nor string it, or shoot an arrow clean through the iron.”\nThen\nto him prudent Penelope responded, saying: “If you\nwere only willing, stranger, to sit on here in my halls\nand amuse me, sleep would never be shed upon my eyelids!\nBut no way can people possibly go without sleep forever;\nand so to each one of us mortals on this grain-giving earth\nthe immortals have allotted a proper time for repose.\nSo I shall go on back to my upper chamber and lie\non my bed, though it’s become a place of mourning for me,\nalways made damp by my tears, since the day when Odysseus\nleft to set eyes on ill Ilion—that unspeakable name!\nThat’s where I shall lie; but you sleep here in the hall—\nspread your own bedding, or have them make you up a bed.”\nSo saying, she went off back to her bright upper chamber,\nnot alone, for her handmaids accompanied her. And after\nshe’d retired to her upper chamber with her handmaids, then\nshe wept for Odysseus, her dear husband, until\ngrey-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\n",

         "\nBut noble Odysseus bedded down for sleep in the forecourt.\nOn the ground he spread out an undressed oxhide, above it\nputting many fleeces from sheep the Achaians had sacrificed;\nand when he settled, Eurynome threw a cloak over him.\nSo Odysseus, brooding on evil for the suitors in his heart\nlay there, still wakeful. And then from their hall the women\nemerged—those who had taken to sleeping with the suitors—\nlaughing and chattering cheerfully one to another; and rage\nerupted now in his breast, and much he debated,\nemotion and reason competing for his decision, whether\nto get up and rush them now, deal death to each one of them,\nor leave them to couple one last and final time\nwith these arrogant suitors. And his inner heart was growling\nas a bitch standing over her helpless puppies will growl\nat some unfamiliar man, more than ready to fight him: so\nhis heart growled within him, enraged at their bad behavior.\nBut he beat his breast, and upbraided his heart, declaring:\n“Endure, my heart! Worse than this you once endured\nthat day when the Kyklops, unmatchable in his strength,\nwas eating my valiant comrades; but you held on, till my plan\nbrought you safe out of that cave where you thought you’d die.”\nSo he spoke, addressing the dear spirit in his breast.\nIn full obedience to him, his heart now endured\nwithout pause; but he himself kept tossing and turning.\nAs a man cooking a paunch chockful of fat and blood\non a fierce blazing fire will turn it to and fro,\ndetermined to get it cooked through as fast as he can,\nso Odysseus tossed this way and that, trying to work out\nhow he was going to lay hands on the shameless suitors,\none man against so many. Then Athene approached him,\ndown from the sky, in appearance like a woman,\nand stood above his head, and addressed him, saying:\n“Wakeful again, you most ill-fated of all mortals?\nThis is your own house, and in this house are your wife\nand son—such a son indeed as anybody might pray for!”\nTo her then resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n“Yes indeed, goddess, all you’ve said is right and proper.\nBut here is what the heart in my breast is debating:\nhow I’m going to lay hands on these shameless suitors,\nalone, while they’re always in a body when they’re here.\nWhat’s more, there’s this greater problem that I’m facing:\neven if—both Zeus and you willing—I do kill them,\nhow then would I make my escape? Please consider that!”\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, responded to him, saying:\n“Stubborn man! There are many who’d trust a weaker comrade—\na mortal, without any knowledge of such wisdom as mine!\nBut I am a god, one who guards you through to the end\nin all your endeavors! And I’ll tell you this openly:\nif there were fifty troops of mortal men in ambush\nall round us, firmly determined to kill us, nevertheless\neven then you’d drive off with their cattle and fattened sheep!\nBut for now let sleep overtake you. To stay awake on watch\nall night is a bad thing too. Soon you’ll be free of troubles.”\nSo she spoke, and shed sleep on his eyelids, but herself,\nbright among goddesses, made her way back to Olympos.\nWhile sleep, the limb-loosener, still had hold of him,\nrelaxing the cares of his heart, his affectionate wife\nawoke and wept, sitting up there, still in her soft bed.\nBut when her spirit had had its fill of weeping, then she,\nbright among women, first prayed to Artemis, saying:\n“Artemis, lady goddess, daughter of Zeus, how I wish\nyou’d shoot a shaft into my breast and take away my life\nnow, at this instant, or a storm wind would snatch me up,\nwhirl me away along those dark murky pathways,\ncast me forth at the mouth of refluent Ocean, as once\nstorm winds carried away Pandareus’ daughters! The gods\nhad killed their parents, and they were left abandoned\nas orphans there in the halls, and were cared for by Aphrodite\nwith cheese and sweet honey and pleasant-tasting wine;\nand Here bestowed on them, above all other women,\nbeauty and wisdom, while chaste Artemis gave them stature,\nand Athene made them accomplished in elegant handiwork.\nBut while bright Aphrodite was making for high Olympos—\nto Zeus, with his joy in the thunderbolt, for well he knows all,\nboth the good fortune and the misfortunes of transient mortals—\nto ask for these girls the fulfillment of a healthy marriage,\nthe storm winds’ spirits meanwhile snatched them away\nand surrendered them to the mercy of the loathsome Furies.\nSo, I wish, might those powers whose homes are on Olympos\nannihilate me, or fair-tressed Artemis strike me—Odysseus\nwould be in my mind’s eye as I went under this hated earth,\nand I’d never pleasure the thoughts of any lesser husband!\nYet the burden’s endurable for anyone who weeps\nin the daytime, constantly moved by deep distress at heart,\nbut is mastered by sleep at night, for sleep brings forgetfulness\nof all things, both good and bad, once it’s shrouded the eyelids.\nYet on me some god laid the burden of evil dreams as well,\nfor this night there lay in my arms one exactly like him,\nas he was when he left with his troops, and so my spirit\nrejoiced, for I thought it no dream, but rather a waking vision.”\nSo she spoke, and straightway Dawn, the golden-throned, came up.\nThe sound of her voice, weeping, got through to noble Odysseus:\nhe tried to think, and it seemed to his half-asleep mind\nthat she’d recognized him and was standing there at his head.\nThen he picked up the cloak, and the fleeces that he’d slept on,\nput them down on a chair in the hall, and carried the oxhide\noutside, and left it. Hands raised, he then made his prayer to Zeus:\n“Zeus, Father, if willingly you gods have now brought me back\nover dry and wet to my country, after troubling me so much,\nlet one of those waking inside speak a word of omen for me,\nand out here a sign from Zeus be made manifest as well.”\nSo he spoke in prayer, and Zeus the Counselor heard him.\nAt once he delivered thunder from gleaming Olympos\non high out of the clouds, and noble Odysseus rejoiced.\nAnd a woman, a grinder of grain, sent forth a word of omen\nfrom the house nearby where the mills of the people’s shepherd\nwere set. At these twelve women all told were workers,\ngrinding barley and wheat, men’s marrow. By now the others\nwere all asleep, having ground their quota of wheat, and she\nwas the only one who’d not finished, for she was the weakest.\nShe stopped her quern now and uttered an omen for her lord:\n“Zeus, Father, lord over gods and men, how loudly\nyou thundered out of the starry sky, yet nowhere is there\nany trace of cloud: this must be a portent you’re granting someone!\nThen fulfill for poor me too the wish I shall now pronounce:\nMay this be the final and latest day on which these suitors\nenjoy their delectable feast in the halls of Odysseus, they\nwho’ve weakened my knees with so much agonizing labor\ngrinding their grain: may this dinner be their last!”\nSo she spoke: noble Odysseus rejoiced at the words of omen\nand the thunder of Zeus, as he planned revenge upon the guilty.\nThe other serving women in Odysseus’ splendid house\nwere up now. They rekindled unwearying fire on the hearth,\nand Telemachos rose from his bed, a godlike mortal,\nput on his clothes, slung a sharp sword from his shoulder,\nbound on a pair of fine sandals under his sleek feet,\npicked out a sturdy spear, tipped with keen bronze, and went\nand stood at the threshold, and then addressed Eurykleia, saying:\n“Dear nurse, have you honored the stranger in our house\nwith a bed and food, or does he lie as he is, uncared-for?\nClever my mother may be, but that’s her way: on impulse\nshe’ll do the honors for some person who’s entirely\nunimportant, yet dismiss his better with no respect.”\nTo him then prudent Eurykleia responded, saying: “Child,\nin this case you shouldn’t blame her, when she’s blameless.\nHe sat there drinking wine as long as he’d a mind to,\nbut for food he said he’d no more appetite: she asked him.\nThen later, when his thoughts turned to lying down and sleep,\nshe told her serving women to make up a bed for him;\nbut he—like some totally wretched and ill-fated person—\ndidn’t want to sleep in a bed or under blankets, but chose\nto doss down on an undressed oxhide and fleeces of sheep\nin the forecourt: we had to throw a cloak over him.”\nSo she spoke. Telemachos made his way out through the hall,\nspear in hand, two hunting dogs at his heels, and went\nto the place of assembly to join the well-greaved Achaians.\nNow Eurykleia, bright among women—daughter of Ops,\nPeisenor’s son—addressed the handmaids, saying: “To work!\nSome of you busy yourselves with sweeping the house out,\nsprinkling the floors, and dressing the well-made chairs\nwith their purple coverlets; others wipe off all the tables\nwith sponges, wash clean the mixing-bowls and the crafted\ntwo-handled drinking cups; others go fetch water\nfrom the spring—and move smartly, get it back here soon!\nFor the suitors won’t be long absent from the hall: they’ll return\ngood and early: this is a public feast day.”\nSo she spoke,\nand each one listened with care and did what she ordered:\ntwenty set off to the spring of dark water, while the rest\nwent knowledgeably about their various tasks in the house.\nThen in came the spirited menservants and began\nto split logs well and skillfully, while the women\nreturned from the spring; and after them came the swineherd\ndriving three hogs, the best ones of all that he had;\nthese he let out to graze in the lush enclosures,\nand himself put a friendly query to Odysseus, saying:\n“Stranger, do the Achaians show you more regard now?\nOr are they still insulting you here in the hall, as before?”\nTo him resourceful Odysseus responded, saying: “Eumaios,\nwould that the gods might exact requital for the outrage\nof these men, who in their arrogance behave so recklessly\nin another man’s house, and have no sense of shame.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nThen up to them came Melanthios, the goatherd, driving\nthose she-goats that were the finest of all in his flocks\nto make a meal for the suitors. Two herdsmen accompanied him.\nThe goats he tethered beneath the echoing colonnade,\nthen addressed Odysseus abusively, saying: “Stranger,\nwon’t you ever stop making yourself a nuisance in this house,\nbegging alms from the men here? Can’t you get out and stay out?\nI’m pretty sure that we two won’t part company until\nwe’ve sampled each other’s fists, since your begging isn’t done\nin the proper way. And besides, there are other Achaian feasts.”\nSo he spoke. Resourceful Odysseus made him no answer,\nbut shook his head in silence, mind brooding on trouble.\nThe third to arrive beside these was Philoitios, leader of men,\ndriving up for the suitors a barren heifer and she-goats\nbrought over by ferrymen, who also convey others,\ntravelers, whoever approaches them for passage.\nThe beasts he tethered with care in the echoing colonnade,\nand then went up to the swineherd, and addressed him, saying:\n“Who is this stranger, swineherd, who’s recently arrived\nhere in our house? From what men does he claim descent?\nWhere is his family? What is the country of his birth?\nIll-fated, yes, but he still has the mien of a lord, a king—\nthough the gods do afflict men who wander far and wide,\nspinning a wretched fate for them, princes though they be.”\nWith that he turned to Odysseus, hand outstretched in greeting,\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “Stranger, father,\nall hail to you! May prosperity be your lot hereafter,\nthough now you’re weighed down by plentiful misfortunes!\nZeus, Father, no other god’s more lethal than you are:\nonce you’ve created men, you show them no pity for\nthe hardship and miserable suffering they must endure!\nI broke sweat at the sight of you, my eyes are full of tears\nas I remember Odysseus, for I fancy he too must be\nclothed in just such rags as he wanders among men—\nthat is, if he’s still living, and sees the light of the sun!\nBut if he’s already dead, down in Hades’ realm, then woe\nis me for peerless Odysseus, who put me in charge\nof his cattle, when I was a boy still, in Kephallenian country.\nBy now they’ve bred past counting: no other way\ncould you get a better harvest of broad-browed cattle!\nBut others now order me to drive these cows in for them\nto eat! They pay no attention to the son of the house,\nnor does the gods’ wrath scare them: these days they’re bent\non sharing out the possessions of their long-absent lord!\nHere is a problem that the heart in my breast turns over\nendlessly: it would be wrong, while the son’s still alive,\nto take off, cattle and all, to the district of others,\nto alien folk: yet it’s worse to stay on here, and suffer\nmisery tending steers now claimed by somebody else!\nLong since, indeed, I’d have fled to some other strong prince,\nsince life here’s no longer endurable; but I still think\nof that unfortunate man, who might yet come back\nfrom wherever, and scatter the suitors throughout his house.”\nTo him resourceful Odysseus responded, saying: “Cowherd,\nsince you seem neither ill-intentioned nor witless, and I\ncan recognize for myself the good sense of your mind,\nI will speak out, and swear a great oath in confirmation:\nZeus, first of gods, be my witness, and this guest-friendly board,\nand the hearth of peerless Odysseus, to which I have come,\nthat indeed while you are here Odysseus shall come home,\nand with your own eyes you shall see, if you’re so minded,\nthe slaughter of the suitors, now lording it here.”\nTo him\nthen responded the herder of cattle, saying: “How I wish,\nstranger, that Kronos’ son would fulfill these words of yours—\nThen you’d discover my strength, and how my hands enforce it!”\nIn like manner Eumaios now prayed to all the gods\nthat quick-witted Odysseus might come back to his own home.\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another.\nMeanwhile the suitors were busy plotting death and doom\nfor Telemachos, when a bird came close to them on the left,\na high-flighted eagle, clutching a tremulous dove. At this\nAmphinomos addressed them, saying: “This plan of ours,\nto murder Telemachos, will not, I fear, end well\nfor us, my friends: let us rather be busy with our feasting.”\nSo Amphinomos spoke, and his words were pleasing to them.\nThey made their way to the house of godlike Odysseus,\ntook off their cloaks, laid them down on the chairs and benches,\nand began the slaughter for sacrifice of large sheep,\nplump goats, and fattened hogs, with a heifer from the herd.\nThey roasted the innards and served them, and mixed the wine\nin bowls, and the swineherd passed drinking cups around,\nwhile Philoitios, leader of men, served them with bread\nin beautiful baskets, and Melanthios poured their wine.\nSo they reached out their hands to the good things ready for them.\nNow Telemachos seated Odysseus—exploiting his advantage—\nin the well-built hall, but close to the stone threshold,\nset a mean stool for him, beside a little table,\nlaid a helping of innards beside him, poured him wine\nin a golden cup, and then addressed him, saying:\n“Sit here among these men now, and drink your wine:\nI myself will protect you from the mockery and the blows\nof all the suitors, since this is no public resort\nbut the house of Odysseus—his legacy to me!\nAnd you suitors, restrain your urge to utter insults\nor use your fists, lest strife—and a fight—arise between us.”\nSo he said. Every one of them bit his lip and marveled\nat Telemachos, because of his bold outspoken manner;\nand Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, now addressed them, saying:\n“Hard though it is, Achaians, we must now accept this speech\nof Telemachos, however boldly his words threaten us—although\nhad Kronos’ son Zeus not forbidden it, we should by now\nhave stopped him short in his halls, clear speaker though he is.”\nSo Antinoos spoke; Telemachos paid no heed to what he said.\nHeralds meanwhile were leading beasts through the city\nfor a lavish sacrifice, and the long-haired Achaians gathered\nbeneath a shady grove of Apollo, the deadly archer.\nWhen they’d roasted the outer meat and drawn it off the spits\nthey shared out the portions and enjoyed a splendid feast;\nand beside Odysseus the servers set a portion equal\nto that which they got themselves: such was the command\nof Telemachos, own dear son of godlike Odysseus.\nAthene, however, would not let these haughty suitors back off\nat all from their grievous conduct: she wanted its pain to sink\nstill deeper into the heart of Laertes’ son Odysseus.\nThere was among the suitors a man bred in lawlessness,\nKtesippos by name, who had his home on Same.\nHe, confident in his possession of prodigious wealth,\nwas courting the wife of the long-absent Odysseus.\nNow he addressed himself to the arrogant suitors, saying:\n“Give ear, you proud suitors: I’ve something to say to you.\nHis portion the stranger’s long had, as is right and proper—\nan equal one: it’s neither decent nor just to short-change\nany guest of Telemachos who may come to this house!\nI too, then, will give him a present, so that he in turn\nmay offer it as a prize to the foot washer or some other\nservant here in the house of godlike Odysseus.”\nSo saying,\nhe hurled with strong hand the hoof of an ox, that he seized\nfrom the basket where it was lying; but Odysseus dodged it,\nquickly ducking his head, and masked his inner anger\nwith a bitter grimace. The ox hoof struck the solid wall.\nTelemachos addressed Ktesippos in harsh words, saying:\n“Ktesippos, this business only let you escape with your life\nsince you didn’t in fact hit the stranger: he dodged your missile!\nOtherwise I’d have run my sharp spear through your body,\nand instead of a wedding your father would have been busy\nfixing your tomb! So let no man be seen misbehaving\nhere in my house: I now note all, and grasp each detail,\ngood or bad, where, before, I was only a child. Yet still\nwe are forced to endure the spectacle of such actions\nas the slaughter of sheep, the endless consumption of wine\nand food, since it’s hard for one man to hold back many.\nCome then, harm me no further in your ill-will—though even\nshould you be determined to murder me with the bronze,\nthat too I’d rather choose: it would be far preferable\nto die than to go on witnessing these unseemly actions—\nstrangers maltreated, women servants forcibly dragged\nand manhandled everywhere in this beautiful building.”\nSo he spoke, and they all were hushed in silence. At last\nAgelaos, son of Damastor, addressed them, saying: “Friends,\nin response to what has been fairly and justly spoken\nno man should take offense, make a hostile retort.\nSo don’t treat this stranger roughly, or indeed any\nof the servants here in the house of godlike Odysseus!\nTo Telemachos and his mother I’d like to say a word\nas a friend, that might just appeal to them both at heart:\nSo long as you in your breasts still nursed the hope\nthat quick-witted Odysseus might yet return to his home,\nthere could be no objection to your holding on, and keeping\nthe suitors at bay in your house, since this was the better course\nwere Odysseus to return, back as lord in his own domain;\nbut it’s clear enough now that he’s never going to return—\nso, Telemachos, sit by your mother and tell her this:\nshe should wed the best of these men, who offers her most:\nthat way you’ll enjoy your inheritance undiminished,\neating and drinking, while she can keep house for someone else.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“No, Agelaos, by Zeus, and by the sufferings of my father.\nwho may have died, or be wandering yet, far from Ithake,\nno way am I delaying my mother’s marriage—I’ve told her\nto wed any man she wants to: I’ll give them countless presents!\nBut I’d be ashamed, were she unwilling, to force her\nout of this house—may no god ever bring such a thing to pass!”\nSo Telemachos spoke. But Pallas Athene now stirred in\nthe suitors laughter unquenchable, sent their wits astray:\nthe jaws from which laughter issued seemed not their own,\nand the meat they were eating bloodstained, while their eyes\nwere brimming with tears, and their minds imagined wailing.\nThen godlike Theoklymenos spoke up among them, saying:\n“Wretched men! What’s this horror you’re suffering? Your heads\nand faces, your knees beneath them, are shrouded in night—\nlamentation’s afire, all dabbled with tears your cheeks,\nblood-bespattered the walls and elegant panels;\ncrowded with ghosts is the forecourt, crowded the yard,\nall flocking in darkness to Erebos, for now the sun\nhas perished from heaven, a foul fog’s swept over all.”\nSo he spoke; but all of them crowed with laughter at him,\nand Eurymachos, Polybos’ son, made the first comment, saying:\n“He’s out of his mind, is this stranger just come from elsewhere!\nQuick, boys, out of the house with him, have him go down\nto the marketplace, since he finds it dark as night in here.”\nTo him godlike Theoklymenos then responded, saying:\n“Eurymachos, I’m not asking you to provide me with guides!\nI still have my own eyes and ears and both my feet,\nand a mind in my breast in no way wrongly fashioned.\nUsing them I shall quit this house, for I sense trouble coming\nupon you that none of the suitors may escape or avoid\nwho here in the house of godlike Odysseus abuse\nother men with violence, commit acts of reckless folly.”\nSo saying, he walked out of that pleasantly sited house,\nand went to Peiraios, who gave him a friendly welcome.\nNow all the suitors, glancing at one another, tried\nto provoke Telemachos by mocking his guests. And thus\nwould one of these haughty youths harangue him, saying:\n“Telemachos, no one has worse luck than you with his guests!\nLike this vagrant here, brought in, whom you maintain—\nalways wanting food and wine, no good at work,\nno strength, nothing but a mere burden on the earth!\nAnd now this other fellow, who stood up and prophesied!\nIf you took my advice, you’d do far better to let us\nthrow these strangers aboard a ship of many rowlocks\nand send them off to the Sikels: they’d fetch you a good price.”\nSo spoke the suitors. Telemachos paid no heed to what they said,\nbut sat silently watching his father, always ready\nfor the moment when he’d lay hands on the shameless suitors.\nIkarios’ prudent daughter Penelope had set down\nher elegant chair so it faced them: she could now hear\nwhat each man was saying, there in the hall. For while\nthey were laughing, they’d also been readying their dinner—\nsweet and satisfying, since they’d slaughtered so many beasts.\nYet no more unpleasant supper could there have been\nthan the one that a goddess and a powerful man\nwould soon serve to those who’d started such vile misdeeds.\n",

         "\nThe goddess, grey-eyed Athene, now put it into the mind\nof Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelope, to bring out\nand set before the suitors the bow and the grey iron\nin Odysseus’ halls: a contest, and the start of the slaughter.\nShe climbed the high ladder that led to her own chamber,\nand with her strong hand picked up the neatly hooked key—\nbronze, finely wrought, with a fitted ivory handle—\nand made her way, with her handmaids, to the very furthest\nstoreroom, where were laid up her lord’s rich treasures:\nitems of bronze and gold and carefully worked iron.\nThere too was stored his back-bent bow and the quiver\nthat held the arrows, and many the hurtful shafts packed in it,\ngifts that a guest-friend gave him when they met in in Lakedaimon—\nIphitos, Eurytos’ son, in appearance like the immortals:\nthe two had encountered one another in Messene\nat the house of skillful Ortilochos. In fact Odysseus\nwas after a public debt then owed by the people:\nfor the men of Messene had come in their many-oared ships\nand lifted three hundred sheep from Ithake, with their shepherds.\nIt was for these that Odysseus had traveled far on a mission\nwhile still a youth, dispatched by his father and other elders.\nIphitos too was there in search of horses he’d lost:\na dozen brood mares, with sturdy suckling mules—\nthough these afterwards brought about his destined murder,\nwhen he came to that stout-hearted son of Zeus, the mighty\nHerakles, well acquainted with violent labors, who\nkilled him, guest though he was, and in his own house—\nmerciless man!—regardless of the gods’ wrath and the table\nhe’d set before Iphitos. The man himself he slaughtered,\nand the strong-hoofed mares he kept in his own domain.\nIt was on his quest for these that Iphitos met Odysseus,\nand gave him the bow once carried by great Eurytos, who\nleft it after his death to his son in his high abode;\nwhile Odysseus gave to Iphitos a sharp sword and a sturdy spear,\nthe start of a binding guest-friendship, yet they never\nknew one another at table; before that, the son of Zeus\nslew Iphitos, Eurytos’ son, in appearance like the immortals,\nwho gave the bow to Odysseus. But Odysseus never\ntook it with him when he went to war aboard the black ships:\nhe left it to lie there at home, a memento of a good friend.\nHe only ever carried it while still in his own country.\nWhen Penelope, bright among women, reached the storeroom,\nand stepped up to the oaken threshold—which a carpenter once\nhad expertly planed and fitted true to the level,\nand set up the doorposts on it, and the shining doors on them—\nat once she briskly detached the thong from its hook,\nand thrust in the key, and shot back the bolts from the doors\nwith a sure aim: they groaned loudly, the noise a bull makes\nas it grazes in pasture: so groaned the beautiful doors,\nattacked by the key, and swiftly flew open for her.\nShe made for a high platform, where stood various chests\nin which fragrant garments were stored. There, reaching up\non tiptoe, she grasped and removed from its peg the bow\ntogether with the bright bow-case in which it was held.\nThis done, she sat down, with the case placed across her knees,\nand burst into loud sobs as she took out her husband’s bow.\nThen, when she’d had her fill of tearful lamentation,\nshe made her way to the hall, where the haughty suitors were,\ncarrying in her hands the back-bent bow, with the quiver\nthat held the arrows, and many a hurtful shaft within it.\nServing women came with her, bearing a chest in which\nmuch iron and bronze lay stored, her husband’s prizes.\nWhen she, bright among women, came where the suitors were,\nshe stood by the central post of the snugly timbered roof,\nholding up her shining veil in front of her face\nand flanked on either side by a devoted handmaid,\nand at once she addressed the suitors, saying: “Hear me,\nyou overbold suitors, you who’ve been using this house\nas a base for feasting and drinking—continually, endlessly—\nwhile its master’s been so long absent; nor could you think up\nany other excuse to offer in support of your presence\nexcept your urge to wed me, make me your wife!—now come,\nsince here, plain as day, is a contest for all you suitors\nthat I’ll set before you: the great bow of godlike Odysseus!\nWhoever, handling this bow, shall string it most easily,\nand then shoot an arrow clear through all twelve axes,\nwith him I’ll depart, leaving this house I first came to\nas a wedded wife—a fine home, and full of rich possessions!\nI think I shall always remember it, even in my dreams.”\nSo she spoke, and then ordered Eumaios, the noble swineherd,\nto set up for the suitors the bow and the grey iron.\nWeeping, Eumaios took and arranged them: the cowherd too\nburst into tears at the sight of his master’s bow. But now\nAntinoos spoke in reproof, and addressed them, saying:\n“Stupid yokels, only concerned with things of the day!\nWhy, wretched pair, are you blubbering? It only agitates\nthe heart in your mistress’ breast! And that heart, as it is,\nlies grief-stricken, since she’s lost her beloved bedfellow!\nEither sit here and feast in silence, or, if cry you must,\ngo and do it outside. But the bow you must leave back here,\na decisive test for the suitors, for I don’t imagine\nthis polished bow will prove an easy one to be strung:\namong all this crowd here there’s not a single man\nsuch as Odysseus was—for I saw him myself,\nand remember him well, though then I was only a child.”\nSo he spoke; but the heart in his breast still hoped that he himself\nwould string the bow, shoot a shaft clear through the iron.\nIn fact, he would be the first to sample an arrow shot\nby that same peerless Odysseus, whom, as he sat in the hall,\nhe was now insulting, and urging his comrades to do likewise.\nThen Telemachos, princely in power, addressed them, saying:\n“Surely Kronos’ son Zeus must have rendered me witless!\nMy own\ndear mother, sensible though she is, declares\nshe’ll abandon this house and go with another husband—\nand yet I, in my witless mind, laugh and enjoy the fun!\nBut come now, you suitors, since here’s the prize before you:\na lady the like of whom there’s none now in all Achaia,\nor sacred Pylos, or Argos, or Mykenai, or even Ithake\nitself, or on the dark mainland. But you yourselves\nknow all this: what need for me to praise my mother?\nSo, don’t sidetrack the matter in hand with excuses, stop\nputting off the bow’s stringing: let’s get to see it now!\nIndeed, I myself might make trial of the bow—and if\nI should string it, and shoot an arrow through the iron,\nI shan’t have to worry about my lady mother leaving\nthis house with another man: I shall still be here, one now\nwell able to win my own father’s splendid contests.”\nWith that he stripped off the scarlet cloak from his shoulders,\nunslung his sharp sword, and sprang to his feet. He then\nfirst of all set up the axes. He dug a trench, a single\nlong trench for them all, cut true to a line, and tamped\nthe earth down round them. All watching him were amazed\nthat he set them up right, having never seen them before.\nThis done, he went to the threshold, to make trial of the bow.\nThree times he made it quiver in his effort to bend it;\nthree times he gave up, though privately he still hoped\nto string the bow and to shoot an arrow through the iron.\nAt his fourth attempt, indeed, he’d have drawn and strung it,\nso determined he was; but Odysseus shook his head, and stopped him.\nTelemachos, princely in power, again addressed them, saying:\n“Oh damn it, even in time to come I’ll be mean and feeble,\nor else I’m too young still, can’t rely on the strength of my hands\nto defend me against some man who starts a quarrel!\nSo come now, all you whose strength is greater than mine,\nmake trial of the bow, and let’s wind up this contest.”\nSo he spoke and grounded the bow, left it standing against\nthe close-fitting, well-polished door panels; and there too\nhe propped a swift arrow against the elegant door hook.\nThen he sat down again on the fine chair from which he’d risen.\nAntinoos now addressed them, the son of Eupeithes, saying:\n“All of you up in order, my comrades, from left to right,\nbeginning from where the cupbearer pours the wine.”\nSo spoke Antinoos, and what he said found approval.\nThe first to stand up was Leiodes, son of Oinops,\ntheir diviner, who always sat at the back of the hall\nby the beautiful mixing bowl: to him alone their reckless\nconduct was hateful. He disapproved of all the suitors.\nHe now was the first to take the bow and swift arrow:\nhe went and stood at the threshold, made trial of the bow,\nbut failed to bend it. His hands—tender, unhardened—\ntoo soon wearied of pulling. He addressed the suitors, saying:\n“Friends, I’m unable to bend it—let another man now try!\nMany the lordly men this bow is going to deprive\nof spirit and life, since indeed it’s far preferable to die\nthan live on after failing at that in pursuit of which\nwe continue assembling here, in daily expectation!\nAt present a man can still not only want but hope\nto marry Penelope, the bedfellow of Odysseus;\nbut when he’s made trial of the bow, and seen the result,\nthen let him court with his gifts some other finely costumed\nAchaian woman, and let Penelope marry whoever\nmakes her the best offer, and comes as her fated spouse.”\nSo he spoke and grounded the bow, left it standing against\nthe close-fitting, polished door panels; and there too\nhe propped a swift arrow, against the elegant door hook.\nThen he sat down again on the fine chair from which he’d risen.\nBut Antinoos spoke in reproof, and addressed him, saying:\n“Leiodes,\nwhat’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth,\nso fearful and grievous an utterance? To hear it enrages me!\nif it’s true that this bow will deprive many lordly men\nof spirit and life, because you yourself can’t bend it,\neven so, though your lady mother didn’t bear you to be\nstrong enough to string bows or shoot arrows, nevertheless\nother proud suitors there are who’ll bend it soon enough!”\nSo he spoke, and gave orders to Melanthios the goatherd:\n“To work, Melanthios! Get the fire going here in the hall,\nand beside it put a large chair with a fleece spread on it,\nand fetch out the big wheel of tallow you’ll find inside,\nso that we youths may warm the bow, and grease it with fat,\nand so get to make trial of it, and conclude this contest.”\nSo he spoke. Melanthios rekindled the unwearying fire,\nfetched, and set close by, a chair with a fleece spread on it,\nthen brought out the large wheel of tallow he found inside.\nWith this the youths warmed the bow, then tried it, but still\nfailed to bend it. They had nothing near the needed strength.\nBut Antinoos still held back, as did godlike Eurymachos:\nthey were the leading suitors, and far the best in prowess.\nTwo men now left the hall, going out together,\nthe cowherd and swineherd of godlike Odysseus; and he,\nnoble Odysseus himself, went close behind them.\nBut when they were all outside the gates and the courtyard,\nthen he spoke, and addressed them in friendly manner, saying:\n“Cowherd, and you too, swineherd, shall I tell you something\nor keep it to myself? Oh, my heart impels me to speak!\nHow would you feel about supporting Odysseus, were he\nsuddenly to appear from somewhere, brought by some god?\nWould you be on the side of the suitors, or of Odysseus?\nTell me whatever your heart and spirit dictate!”\nIn answer\nthe herdsman who cared for the cattle responded, saying:\n“Zeus, Father, would that you might fulfill this wish! Now grant\nthat man his return, and a god to escort him! Then\nyou’d learn what strength I have, and how my hands employ it!”\nEumaios in the same way likewise prayed to all the gods\nthat quick-witted Odysseus might return to his own home.\nSo when he’d found out for certain how these two were minded,\nOdysseus once more responded, and addressed them, saying:\n“Back home now indeed I am! After suffering much hardship\nI’ve returned, in the twentieth year, to my native country!\nI know that to both of you, alone of all my servants,\nmy arrival is truly welcome: of the rest I’ve not heard one\npray that I might return, make it back to my home!\nSo to you two I’ll speak the truth, how it’s going to be:\nif a god grants me victory over these haughty suitors,\nI’ll find wives for you both, and give you possessions,\nand houses built close to my own; and for me thereafter\nyou’ll be Telemachos’ comrades, indeed his brethren!\nAnd look, I’ll show you another manifest sign\nby which you may know me for sure and trust what I say—\nthe scar of the wound that I got from a boar’s white tusk\nlong ago, when I went up Parnassos with Autolykos’ sons.”\nSo saying, he pulled back his rags from over the great scar.\nWhen the two had examined it carefully, in detail,\nweeping they flung their arms about skillful Odysseus\nand kissed his head and his shoulders in loving welcome,\nwhile Odysseus likewise was kissing their heads and hands.\nAnd now the sun would have gone down on their tears\nhad not Odysseus himself put a stop to it, saying: “Quit\nyour weeping and wailing! Somebody coming out here\nfrom the hall might see us and report back to those inside.\nNow, you two go on in, but separately, not together—\nI’ll go first, you after me. And let’s have this as a signal:\nall the others, the whole crowd of these haughty suitors,\nwon’t agree to me being given the bow and the quiver;\nbut you, noble Eumaios, as you go through the house\nwith the bow, put it into my hands—and order the women\nto bar the close-fitting doors at the entrance to their quarters;\nand if any of them hear groans, or the thud of falling\nmen within our walls, they’re not to go out, but remain\njust where they are, keep silent, and go on with their work.\nAnd to you, noble Philoitios, I entrust the task of bolting\nthe courtyard gates, and quickly roping them shut as well.”\nSo saying, he made his way into the pleasantly sited house,\nand went and sat down on the chair from which he’d risen;\ngodlike Odysseus’ two servants then followed him inside.\nEurymachos was now turning the bow about in his hands,\nwarming it, this side and that, in the fire’s glow; yet not even\nthus could he bend it: his lordly heart was sore vexed,\nand, deeply troubled, he now addressed them, saying:\n“Alas, here’s distress for myself and for all of you too!\nIt’s not this lost marriage that I lament so much,\ngrieved though I am; there are many Achaian ladies,\nsome here on sea-girt Ithake, and more in other cities.\nBut if we’re so far lacking in strength compared\nto godlike Odysseus that we can’t even bend and string\nhis bow—that’s a disgrace that men yet unborn will hear of.”\nAntinoos, son of Eupeithes, then responded to him, saying:\n“It will not be so, Eurymachos, as you know very well!\nThroughout the region this is the god’s solemn feast day—\nwho’d be bending a bow now? Today we’ll take things easy,\nso put that aside! And why don’t we leave all the axes standing\nwhere they are? No one, I think, is going to come here, to the hall\nof Odysseus, Laertes’ son, and remove them! So for now\nlet the wine steward pour the initial drops in our cups\nso we can offer libations, and lay the curved bow aside;\nthen early tomorrow morning tell the goatherd Melanthios\nto bring the very best she-goats in all the herds, so we\nmay offer thigh-pieces to Apollo the famous archer,\nand then make trial of the bow and conclude the contest.”\nSo spoke Antinoos, and what he said found approval.\nNow the heralds poured water over their hands, and youths\nfilled up the mixing-bowls with drink, poured drops\ninto the cups for libation, then served wine to all.\nAfter they’d offered libations and drunk all they’d a mind to,\nresourceful Odysseus addressed them, with deception in mind:\n“Listen to me, you suitors of the illustrious queen,\nto what the heart in my breast now urges me to tell you!\nTo Eurymachos most of all, and to godlike Antinoos\nI appeal, since the latter got it right when he said\nthat for now you should put the bow by, let the gods decide—\nIn the morning the god will confer the power where he wishes!\nBut come, give the polished bow to me, that here among you\nI may try out my hands and strength, see whether the force\nis still there, as when my limbs were supple, or whether\nby now lack of care and vagrancy have destroyed it.”\nSo he spoke, and they all expressed high indignation,\nafraid as they were that he might string the polished bow.\nSo Antinoos spoke in reproof, and addressed him, saying:\n“Ah, wretched stranger, devoid of even the slightest sense!\nIs it not enough for you that you dine at ease among us,\nyour betters, that you’re barred from none of the feast, sit in\non all our conversation, when there’s no other stranger\nor beggar who gets to listen to everything we say?\nIt’s the wine, the honey-sweet wine, that damages you, just as\nit harms anyone who swills it, who drinks to excess! It was wine\nthat infatuated the Centaur, far-famed Eurytion,\nin the hall of great-hearted Peirithoos, when he went\nto visit the Lapiths: there, wits fuddled with wine,\nin his madness he wrought evil in Peirithoos’ house.\nOutraged, the heroes sprang on him, dragged him outside\nthrough the forecourt, cut off his ears and nose\nwith the pitiless bronze; and he, now stupefied in mind,\nwent about with his unstable spirit bearing that fatal burden.\nHence sprang the feud between the Centaurs and mankind;\nbut he first for himself met trouble, when heavy with wine.\nAnd for you I foresee great misery should you indeed\nbend and string this bow: you’ll find no courtesy here\nin our district—we’ll send you straight off in a black ship\nto King Echetos, maimer of all mortal men alive,\nfrom whom you would have no escape. So now sit quiet,\ndrink your wine, don’t contend with men younger than yourself.”\nPrudent Penelope responded to him, saying: “It’s neither\ndecent nor just, Antinoos, to deprive Telemachos’ guests\n—whoever may come to the house here—of their proper due!\nDo you expect, if this stranger, trusting his hands and strength,\nstrings the great bow of Odysseus, that he’ll then take me\noff to his home, and make me his bedfellow? I’m sure\nthat he himself now nurses no such expectation!\nSo none of you need to worry on that account, or let it\nspoil your appetite here: that indeed would be unseemly.”\nEurymachos, Polybos’ son, then responded to her, saying:\n“Ikarios’ daughter, prudent Penelope, we don’t think\nthis man will make off with you—yes, that would be unseemly!—\nbut the gossip of men and women could embarrass us: some low\nAchaian lout may well later start saying this kind of thing:\n‘Oh yes, far weaker men now are courting the bedfellow\nof a faultless man—they can’t even string his polished bow!\nBut some other fellow, a vagrant beggar, who turned up here\nstrung the bow easily, and shot clear through the iron.’\nSo men will talk, and this would be a reproach to us all.”\nThen prudent Penelope once more responded to him, saying:\n“Eurymachos, no way can good report spread in public\nabout those who devour, and so dishonor, a nobleman’s\nhousehold goods! Why make this, then, a matter for reproach?\nThe stranger’s a very big fellow, and strongly built; he also\nclaims he’s the son of a father of excellent ancestry.\nSo give him the polished bow now, and let’s see what happens!\nFor this I’ll declare to you, and it shall come to pass:\nif he does string the bow, and Apollo lets him triumph,\nI’ll dress him in cloak and tunic, fine quality garments,\nand give him a sharpened javelin, to ward off dogs and men,\nand a double-edged sword, and sandals to strap on under\nhis feet, and send him wherever his heart and spirit dictate.”\nThen sagacious Telemachos responded to her, saying:\n“There’s not one Achaian, my mother, more entitled than myself\nto give, or refuse, this bow to whomsoever I please—\nnot any of those who hold power here on rugged Ithake,\nor lord it over the islands toward horse-pasturing Elis!\nOf these none will thwart my will, even if I choose to make\nan outright gift of the bow, for this stranger to carry off!\nInto the house with you now, attend to your own tasks—\nthe loom and the distaff! And give orders to your handmaids\nto stick to their proper work! The bow shall be men’s business—\nall men’s, but mine above all: in this house I hold the power.”\nAstonished, Penelope went back into the house,\nand took to heart her son’s sagacious remarks.\nshe climbed to her upper chamber with her handmaids,\nand there she wept for Odysseus, her dear husband, until\ngrey-eyed Athene shed sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\nThe noble swineherd now picked up the curved bow,\nand was bearing it off; but the suitors all clamored in the hall,\nand thus would one of the arrogant younger men exclaim:\n“Where, wretched swineherd, are you taking that curved bow?\nAre you crazy? The hunting dogs you bred yourself will soon\nwolf you down, all alone among your pigs, if Apollo\nlooks kindly upon us—he, and the other immortal gods.”\nSo they spoke. Right there he dropped the bow where he stood,\nterrified: they were so many, the noise in the hall so loud.\nBut Telemachos shouted threateningly from the other side:\n“Old fellow, keep on with the bow! Obey them, and you’ll be sorry!\nThough I’m younger than you I’ll chase you out to the fields\nwith a shower of stones! At least I’m stronger than you!\nI only wish I was tougher, and a better man with my fists,\nthan all the suitors arrayed here in these halls: then I’d\nsoon send some of them packing from our house\nin a dire state, because of the trouble they make here.”\nSo he spoke, but the suitors all laughed cheerfully at him,\nforgetting the bitter resentment that they’d long nursed\nagainst Telemachos. The swineherd carried the bow\nthrough the hall to skillful Odysseus, placed it in his hands,\nthen summoned the nurse Eurykleia, and addressed her, saying:\n“Orders for you from Telemachos, prudent Eurykleia:\nyou’re to bar the close-fitted doors at the entrance to your quarters,\nand if any of you hear groans or the thud of falling\nmen here within our walls, they’re not to go out, but remain\njust where they are, keep silent, and go on with their work.”\nSo he spoke; but her answer remained unwinged. She went\nand barred the doors of their pleasantly sited quarters,\nwhile Philoitios said nothing, but hurried out of the house,\nand barred the gates to the well-walled courtyard. Down\nin the colonnade there lay coiled a shapely vessel’s\nfiber cable: with this he secured the gates, and himself\nwent back in, sat down on the chair from which he’d risen,\nand watched Odysseus, who was already handling the bow,\nkept turning it round, made trial of it this way and that,\nto see if worms had eaten the horn in its master’s absence;\nand thus would an onlooker speak, with a glance at his neighbor:\n“He must be a connoisseur, some kind of expert in bows!\nEither he himself has such fine bows stored back home,\nor else he intends to make one, the way he turns it about\nthis way and that—evildoer and vagrant that he is!”\nAnd another of these haughty youths would speak up, saying:\n“I wish just as much good fortune for this old fellow\nas he’s likely to get in the contest for stringing the bow.”\nSuch was the talk of the suitors. But resourceful Odysseus,\nas soon as he’d got his great bow and viewed it all over—\njust as a man, a professional lyre player and singer,\nwill easily stretch the string around a new peg, secure\nthe twisted sheep gut at either end, so now\nOdysseus without hard effort strung the great bow,\nand took it in his right hand, and tested the string,\nwhich sang good and high at his touch, like a swallow’s voice.\nThe suitors were much distressed. The faces of them all\nchanged color. Zeus thundered loudly, making plain his signs,\nand much-enduring noble Odysseus now rejoiced\nthat sly-counselling Kronos’ son had sent him an omen.\nHe picked up the swift shaft that lay there on the table,\nready (the rest were still stored in their hollow quiver—\nthose arrows that the Achaians were soon to experience),\nset it on the bow’s hand grip, then—still seated\nthere in his chair—drew the string with the notched arrow,\ntook careful aim, and let fly. He did not miss one helve base\nof all the axes: clean through and out at the end\nflew his bronze-heavy shaft. He addressed Telemachos, saying:\n“The stranger that sits in your hall, Telemachos, does you no\ndiscredit: I neither missed the mark, nor spent\nmuch labor on stringing the bow. My strength is still there—\nnot gone, as these suitors insult me by claiming so mockingly!\nBut now it’s time to get dinner ready for the Achaians—\nin daylight. And after that there’s other entertainment,\nsongs and the lyre, the accompaniment to feasting.”\nThen godlike Odysseus signaled them with his eyebrows,\nand his dear son Telemachos strapped on his keen-edged sword,\nand put out a hand to the spear, tipped with gleaming bronze,\nthat was standing close to him, propped up beside his chair.\n",

         "\nNow resourceful Odysseus stripped himself of his rags\nand sprang up on the great threshold, taking the bow\nand the shaft-packed quiver. He poured out the swift arrows\nthere at his feet, and addressed the suitors, saying:\n“This contest’s over, decisively ended; and now\nI’ll go for another target, reached by no man hitherto,\nto see whether I can hit it, and Apollo grant me glory.”\nHe spoke, and then aimed a bitter shaft at Antinoos,\nwho was on the point of raising an elegant cup to his lips—\ngolden, twin-eared—had it in his hands, was intending\nto drink wine from it: in his mind was no thought of death.\nFor who amid fellow feasters would ever imagine\nthat one man, however strong, alone against many,\nwould contrive for him a bad death and black fate? But Odysseus\ntook aim and struck him in the throat with his arrow,\nand clear through the tender neck the point was driven,\nand he slumped to one side, the cup dropped from his hand\nwhen he was hit, and up through his nostrils at once\ncame a thick spurt of human blood; a kick of his foot\nsent the table flying, scattered all the food on the floor,\nbread and roast meat in the dirt together. The suitors\nmade an uproar throughout the hall when they saw the man\nfallen: sprang from their seats, panic-stricken, in the hall,\nlooking all round at the solid walls, but nowhere\nwas there a shield or strong spear that they could grab.\nSo they abused Odysseus in furious words, declaring:\n“It’s an outrage, stranger, for you to shoot men! You’ll never\ncompete in another contest! Now you’ve sealed your fate!\nThe man you killed was by far the noblest of the youths\non Ithake: because of that the vultures shall eat you here.”\nSo said each of them, for indeed they supposed he’d not\nkilled the man on purpose: poor fools, they had no notion\nthat over them all the bonds of destruction were set.\nThen, with an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus replied:\n“You dogs, you thought that I’d never come home again\nfrom the Trojans’ land, the way you ravaged my house,\nand forcibly bedded my women servants, and while\nI was still alive, underhandedly courted my wife,\nwith no fear of the gods who own broad heaven,\nor of any human reproof that might come hereafter!\nNow over you all the bonds of destruction are set!”\nSo he spoke. Pale dread possessed them all: each man\nlooked round for a way to escape from sheer destruction.\nOnly Eurymachos now responded to him, saying:\n“If you indeed are Odysseus, come home to Ithake, then\nwhat you say about all the Achaians have done is just—\nmany their wanton acts, here in the house, out afield!\nBut the man lies dead who was to blame for it all—\nAntinoos! He it was who instigated these deeds,\nnot so much out of desire or need for the marriage,\nbut with a different aim, not fulfilled by Kronos’ son:\nthat over well-ordered Ithake he might himself\nbe king—and lie in wait for your son and kill him!\nNow he’s been fairly slain, spare these people: they are\nyour own! And hereafter we’ll collect you reparation\nfor all that’s been drunk or eaten here in this hall,\neach man providing you with the worth of twenty oxen!\nWe’ll requite you in bronze and gold until your heart is softened;\nbut until that time comes no man could blame you for your anger.”\nThen. with an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded:\n“Eurymachos, were you to give me all you had from your fathers,\nall that you now possess, plus what you could find elsewhere,\nnot even so would I stay my hands from slaughter\nuntil the suitors had paid the full price for their wrongdoing!\nNow it’s your choice whether you’ll stand and fight me\nor run—if anyone here can dodge death and its spirits;\nbut none of you, I think, will escape from sheer destruction.”\nSo he spoke: there and then their knees and hearts gave way.\nBut Eurymachos now spoke again, and addressed them, saying:\n“Friends, this man won’t restrain his invincible hands!\nNow he’s got control of the polished bow and its quiver\nhe’ll shoot from the smooth-worn threshold until he’s killed\nevery last one of us! We must think about how to fight him!\nSo draw your swords now, hold the tables in front of you\nagainst his swift deadly arrows, and then let’s all go for him\nin a body, try to shift him from the threshold and doorway,\nthen get to the city, raise a quick hue and cry. Do that,\nand this fellow will soon have shot his last shaft.”\nSo saying,\nhe now unsheathed his sharp sword, fashioned of bronze,\nwith its double edge, and made for Odysseus, yelling out\nhis fearsome war cry. At the same instant noble Odysseus\nlet fly another arrow. The swift shaft struck his breast\nunder the nipple, drove into his liver. He dropped his sword\non the ground, and fell, doubled up and sprawling, over\nthe table: the food all went flying to the ground, along with\nhis two-handled cup. His forehead smashed agonizingly\ninto the ground; both feet kicked out at his chair,\ndislodging it. A mist closed down over his eyes.\nAmphinomos next attacked renowned Odysseus, charging\nstraight at him, keen-edged sword ready and drawn, to see\nif he could force him back from the doorway. Telemachos\nwas too quick, aimed from behind with his bronze-tipped spear,\nand hit him between the shoulders, drove right through\nhis breast. He fell with a thud, hit the ground forehead first.\nBut Telemachos sprang back, left his far-shadowing spear\nthere in Amphinomos, much afraid that some Achaian—\nwhile he was busy prising that long spear loose—might rush up\nand give him a sword thrust, catch him still stooping. So he\nset off at a run, quickly reached his dear father, stood close\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “Father,\nI’ll go now and fetch you a shield and a couple of spears,\nand an all-bronze helmet, close-fitting at the temples.\nI’ll arm myself too while I’m gone, and get arms for the swineherd\nand the cowherd too: for sure, to be in armor is better.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“Run, fetch them, while I still have arrows for my defense,\nlest they force me away from the doors, all alone as I am.”\nSo he spoke, and Telemachos, in obedience to his father,\nmade his way to the storeroom where their fine arms were kept,\nand from there collected four shields, eight spears, and four\nbronze-plated helmets, decked with thick crests of horsehair.\nCarrying these, he quickly returned to his dear father.\nThen, first, he armored his own body in bronze,\nand the two servants likewise put on their splendid gear,\nand stood there flanking clever, subtle-minded Odysseus.\nHe, while he still had arrows for his defense, went after\nthe suitors, one by one, never stopping, there in his house,\naiming, then shooting. They kept falling, thick and fast.\nBut when the master had no more arrows to shoot,\nthe bow he propped up against the pleasantly sited hall’s\ndoorpost, to stand by the bright inner walls. He now\nslung from his shoulders a fourfold shield, and on\nhis powerful head next settled a well-made helmet\nwith a horsehair plume nodding fearsomely up above,\nand took two sturdy spears, both tipped with bronze.\nThere existed a side postern set in the solid wall,\nflush with the top of the pleasantly sited hall’s threshold,\nthat led into a corridor and had a close-fitting door.\nOn this corridor Odysseus ordered the noble swineherd\nto keep a close watch (one man only could rush it at a time),\nsince Agelaos had called out to all the suitors, saying:\n“Friends, won’t one of you now slip out by that side postern,\nget word to the people, raise a quick hue and cry? Do that,\nand this fellow will soon have taken his last shot.”\nThen Melanthios, herder of goats, responded to him, saying:\n“That won’t work, Agelaos, Zeus’ nursling: the fine courtyard\ndoors are dangerously close, and the corridor is narrow:\none man, if a good fighter, could hold off all comers. So let me\ngo fetch armor for us to put on, from his private storeroom;\nfor that, I’m certain, and no place else, is where\nOdysseus and his illustrious son have stowed their gear.”\nSo saying, Melanthios, herder of goats, went up\nby the steps of the hall to the storerooms of Odysseus.\nFrom there he took twelve shields, and a dozen spears,\nand as many bronze helmets with thick horsehair crests,\nand made his way back, and quickly gave them to the suitors.\nThen Odysseus’ knees and courage both wilted as he saw them\ngirding themselves in armor and brandishing long spears\nin their hands, and huge his task now appeared to him,\nand at once he addressed Telemachos with winged words, saying:\n“Telemachos, it must be one of the women in the halls\nis backing this bad fight against us—or maybe Melanthios.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“I myself, father, made the mistake here—no one else\nis to blame! It was I who left the close-fitting door\nof the storeroom ajar: they kept a sharper watch than I did!\nYou go now, noble Eumaios, and shut that storeroom door,\nand see if it’s one of the women who’s behind this, or,\nas I suspect, Melanthios, Dolios’ son.”\nSuch was\nthe conversation between them, one to the other.\nBut Melanthios, herder of goats, went back to the storeroom\nto fetch more fine armor. The noble swineherd saw him,\nand at once addressed Odysseus, close by him, saying:\n“Scion of Zeus, Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\nthere’s that dangerous busybody—the one we ourselves\nsuspect—off back to the storeroom! So tell me truthfully,\nam I to kill the man, if I prove the better fighter,\nor bring him here to you, to pay for the misdemeanors,\nall of them, that he’s committed here in your house?”\nTo him\nResourceful Odysseus then responded, saying: “For sure,\nI and Telemachos will hold off these haughty suitors,\nkeep them shut in the hall here, however hard they struggle!\nYou two should force both that man’s hands and feet\nbehind his back, lash them to boards there, dump him\ninto the storeroom, attach a braided rope to his body,\nhoist him up the tall column until he’s near the roof beams:\nthat way he’ll stay alive longest and suffer real agony.”\nSo he spoke. They listened carefully and obeyed him.\nTo the storeroom they went, unnoticed by the man inside,\nwho was searching for armor far in the back. The two\nlay in wait for him, standing on either side of the doorway.\nWhen Melanthios, herder of goats, was crossing the threshold—\nin one hand a splendid helmet, and in the other\nan old broad shield, that was all befouled with mildew\nand belonged to the hero Laertes, who’d carried it when young,\nbut it had long been laid up, the seams of its straps were rotted—\nthe two sprang, seized him, dragged him in by his hair,\nflung him down, sore anguished at heart, on the ground.\nThey lashed his hands and feet tight with agonizing bonds,\nforcing them right behind his back, exactly the way\nthat Laertes’ son, much-enduring noble Odysseus\nhad told them to do. They attached a braided rope to his body,\nand hauled him up the tall column until he was near the roof beams.\nThen, swineherd Eumaios, you made mock of him, saying:\n“This way, Melanthios, you’ll keep watch the whole night,\nlying there on the kind of soft bed that’s proper for you;\nnor shall Dawn, early risen, coming up from Ocean’s streams\nin gold-throned splendor escape your notice as you\nbring the suitors your she-goats to set up a feast in the hall.”\nSo he was left there, stretched tight in his deadly bonds,\nwhile the two put on their armor, closed the bright door,\nand made their way back to clever, subtle-minded Odysseus.\nThere they stood on the threshold, breathing courage,\nfour men against a crowd of good fighters in the feast hall.\nThen Zeus’ daughter Athene came up close to them,\nassuming the likeness of Mentor, in both voice and person.\nOdysseus rejoiced at the sight of her, and addressed her, saying:\n“Mentor, defend us from harm, remember your dear comrade\nwho used to do you good turns: you and I are the same age.”\nSo he spoke: but he guessed it was Athene the host-rallier.\nThe suitors across from him made an uproar in the hall\nand the first to rebuke Athene was Damastor’s son Agelaos:\n“Mentor, don’t let Odysseus sidetrack you with his glib talk\ninto fighting against the suitors and giving aid to him!\nFor this is how I think our purpose will be accomplished:\nwhen we kill these men, both father and son, you too\nwill be slain along with them, for the deeds you’re so eager\nto perform in these halls: with your own head you’ll pay for them!\nAnd when with the bronze we’ve stripped you of your violence,\nall the possessions you have, whether indoor or outside,\nwe’ll add to those of Odysseus! We won’t let your sons live\nin your halls, nor grant your daughters or your good wife\nthe right to move freely about Ithake.”\nSo he spoke,\nand Athene grew even more furious at heart,\nand upbraided Odysseus with angry words: “No longer\nis your courage steadfast, Odysseus, nor that fine prowess\nyou showed when over Helen—high-born, white-armed—\nfor nine years you fought the Trojans unceasingly,\nand many fighters you killed in that dread conflict—\nit was your advice brought down Priam’s broad-wayed city!\nWhy then now, when you’re back to home and possessions,\ndo you wail at the thought of facing up to the suitors?\nSo come here, my friend, stand beside me, watch me at work,\nand see the way, when up against hostile fighters,\nthat Alkimos’ son Mentor repays your good services!”\nShe spoke, yet still did not give him enough strength to prevail\nin his battle, was still making trial of the might and valor\nboth of Odysseus himself and of his illustrious son.\nAnd now she flew up to a roof beam of the smoky hall\nand perched there in plain view, in the likeness of a swallow.\nAgelaos, Damastor’s son, was now urging the suitors on,\nwith Eurynomos, Amphimedon, Demoptolemos,\nPeisandros, Polyktor’s son, and skillful Polybos;\nfor these were by far the most valiant of the suitors\nwho were still alive and fighting for their survival: the pick\nof the rest had already fallen to the bow and constant arrows.\nAgelaos then spoke among them, addressing them all: “My friends,\nthis man by now must surely hold up his invincible hands!\nAfter all those empty boasts his friend Mentor’s deserted him,\nand they’re left by themselves there at the outer doorway!\nSo don’t now throw your long spears at them all together,\nbut you six throw first, see whether Zeus will maybe\ngrant that Odysseus be hit, and we win the glory—\nonce he’s fallen, there’s no need to worry about the others.”\nSo he spoke. They all threw their spears as he suggested,\nwith force; but Athene made all their efforts unsuccessful.\nOne of them hit a doorpost of the well-built feast hall,\na second the close-fitting door itself; another’s\nbronze-weighted ash spear ended up against the wall.\nSo when the suitors’ spears had missed them, much-enduring\nOdysseus at once addressed them, saying: “My friends,\nthis, I’d say, is the moment for us too now to hurl\nour own spears into the thick of these suitors, who are so eager\nto kill and strip us, on top of their earlier misdemeanors.”\nSo he spoke, and they all now threw their keen-edged spears\nwith careful aim. Odysseus hit Demoptolemos;\nTelemachos, Euryades; the swineherd, Elatos; while\nthe cowherd who cared for the cattle killed Peisandros.\nThese then all together bit the wide earth with their teeth,\nand the suitors retreated to the innermost part of the hall,\nwhile the others rushed forward and pulled their spears from the dead.\nThen once more the suitors threw their keen-edged spears\nwith force, but Athene made their efforts mostly unsuccessful.\none of them hit a doorpost of the well-built feast hall,\na second the close-fitting door itself; another’s\nbronze-weighted ash spear ended up against the wall.\nbut Amphimedon hit Telemachos on the arm at his wrist,\na glancing blow, the bronze scraping the surface of the skin,\nand Ktesippos with his long spear grazed Eumaios’ shoulder\nabove his shield, but the spear flew on, ended in the ground.\nThen once more those with the sharp and subtle-minded Odysseus\nflung their own keen-edged spears into the thick of the suitors,\nand once more Odysseus, city-sacker, scored a hit,\non Eurydamas; Telemachos on Amphimedon; the swineherd\non Polybos, while the herder of cattle struck Ktesippos\nsquare in the breast, and boasted over him, saying:\n“Polytherses’ son, insult-fancier, nevermore, ever, again\nthoughtlessly talk big, but leave any kind of comment\nto the gods, since they are far mightier! Here is a guest-gift\nfor you, a return for that ox hoof you lately presented\nto godlike Odysseus, on his begging round in the house.”\nSo spoke the crumple-horned cattle’s herder; but Odysseus\nnow wounded Damastor’s son with his long spear, close up,\nand Telemachos wounded Leokritos, Euenor’s son,\nwith a spear in the nether belly, drove the bronze through:\nhe fell prone, hitting the ground squarely with his forehead.\nThen Athene held up her aegis, the destroyer of mortals,\nfrom on high in the roof: the suitors were terrified,\nand stampeded through the hall like a herd of cows\nthat the darting gadfly descends on and drives to distraction\nin the season of spring, when the days are lengthening;\nand just as vultures, with crooked talons and hooked beaks,\ncome out from the mountains and swoop down on other birds,\nthat fly fast over the plain, and avoid the clouds, but still\nthe vultures pounce and destroy them: they have no defense\nor way of escape, and men enjoy watching the hunt—\nso now did they harry the suitors throughout the hall,\nstriking them right and left, and hideous cries went up\nas their heads were cracked, and the whole floor ran with blood.\nLeiodes rushed forward and clasped Odysseus’ knees\nand with winged words entreated him, saying: “I beg you\nby your knees, Odysseus, respect me and pity me! Never,\nI tell you, have I offended any woman here in your halls\nby improper word or deed: in fact I did my best\nto stop any other suitor who began to behave that way!\nBut they took no notice, wouldn’t restrain their hands from mischief,\nand through such wanton misconduct have met a ghastly fate.\nYet I, their soothsayer, who have done no wrong, will die\nalong with them: there’s no gratitude for benefits received!”\nWith an angry glance, resourceful Odysseus responded, saying:\n“If, as you claim, you in fact are their soothsayer, then surely\nmany times you’ll have made a prayer in my halls that the end\nof a sweet homecoming might be kept far from me, that you\nmight be the one with whom my dear wife went, bore children!\nFor that you won’t escape a most bitter death.”\nSo saying,\nhe seized in his sturdy hand a sword that lay nearby:\nAgelaos had dropped it at the moment when he was killed.\nWith this sword Odysseus now slashed through Leiodes’ neck.\nThe man was still speaking as his head rolled in the dust.\nTerpes’ son too, the minstrel, was still trying to avoid black fate—\nPhemios, who was compelled to perform among the suitors.\nHe now stood holding the clear-toned lyre in his hands,\nclose to the postern door, uncertain in his mind\nwhether to slip from the hall and sit at the well-built altar\nof Zeus of Enclosures, on which Laertes and Odysseus\nhad burnt in his honor so many thighs of oxen,\nor whether to run to Odysseus, entreat him at his knees.\nAnd as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\nto run up and clasp the knees of Laertes’ son Odysseus.\nSo he laid down his hollow lyre upon the floor\nbetween the mixing-bowl and his silver-studded chair,\nand himself ran forward and clasped Odysseus by the knees,\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “By your knees\nI entreat you, Odysseus! Respect me and pity me! On you\nhereafter shall sorrow be laid, if you choose to kill a minstrel\nsuch as I am, who performs for both gods and mankind!\nI am self-taught, but the god has planted in my heart\nlays of all kinds: I’m equipped to perform before you\nas I would for a god—so don’t be too ready to cut my throat!\nTelemachos too, your dear son, could testify to the fact\nthat it was against my will, with no desire on my part,\nthat I came to your house to sing for the suitors at their feasts—\nthey were stronger, and far more of them: they made me come.”\nSo he spoke. Telemachos, princely in power, heard him,\nand at once he addressed his nearby father, saying:\n“Whatever you do, don’t maim this innocent man with the bronze!\nLet’s also spare Medon the herald, who used to look after me\nhere in our house while I was still a child—that is,\nif Philoitios or the swineherd hasn’t already killed him,\nor he ran into you when you were storming through the house.”\nSo he spoke, and Medon, sagacious at heart, overheard him.\nHe’d ducked down under a chair, and wrapped himself in\nthe fresh-flayed hide of an ox, trying to avoid black fate.\nAt once he got up from the chair, quickly threw off the oxhide,\nrushed forward, clasped Telemachos by the knees,\nand uttering winged words then entreated him, saying:\n“Friend, here I am, it is I! Stay your hand, speak to your father,\nlest in his great strength he hurt me with the sharp bronze\nwhile incensed against these men, the suitors, who wasted\nhis goods here in his halls, and—the fools!—paid you no honor.”\nBut resourceful Odysseus smiled, and then addressed him, saying:\n“Relax! Telemachos here has protected you and saved you,\nso you may know in your heart, and pass the word to others,\nhow much better kind actions are than mean ones! But for now\nleave the feast hall, go sit down outside in the courtyard,\naway from the slaughter, you and the lay-rich minstrel,\nuntil I’ve finished the work I need to do here indoors.”\nSo he spoke. The two now went off, out of the feast hall,\nand sat themselves down by great Zeus’ altar, glancing\nin all directions, still half-expecting to be murdered.\nOdysseus too looked around, in his domain, to see whether\nany man, still alive, was hiding, in an effort to dodge black fate.\nBut what he saw was each one of them in the blood and dust—\nthe whole crowd, fallen, dead, like fish that fishermen\nhave drawn in their fine-meshed net up from the grey sea\nonto some crescent beach, and they all are lying there\nheaped up on the sand, sorely missing the waves of the sea;\nbut Helios, the bright sun, now heats the life out of them—\njust so the suitors all lay there, heaped up upon one another.\nResourceful Odysseus now addressed Telemachos, saying:\n“Telemachos, go and summon the nurse Eurykleia to me:\nThere’s something I have on my mind that I need to say to her.”\nSo he spoke, and Telemachos, in obedience to his father,\nwent and opened the door, and called to Eurykleia, saying:\n“Up with you now, old woman—you who are in charge\nof all the serving women we have in our hall—come here!\nMy father is calling for you, he wants to say something to you.”\nSo he spoke. Her own word remained unwinged: she opened\nthe doors of the well-built feast hall, and came out, Telemachos\nleading the way before her. She found Odysseus\nstanding amid the bodies of the men he had killed,\nbespattered with blood and gore, like a lion that’s come\nfrom the farmstead where it’s been feeding on an ox, and all\nits breast and its jowls on either side are beslobbered\nwith blood, so that it is a terrible sight to behold—\njust so was Odysseus bespattered, hands and feet alike.\nBut she, on beholding the corpses and the widespread bloodshed,\nbegan a cry of triumph, for the mighty deed she saw;\nbut Odysseus stopped her, cut short her enthusiasm,\nand uttering winged words, addressed her, saying:\n“Keep your joy to yourself, old woman—don’t exult aloud!\nIt’s not decent to vaunt over men that have been killed.\nThese dead were destroyed by divine fate and their own\ndastardly acts: they honored no mortals on this earth,\neither high or low, of those that came among them,\nand so through their wanton deeds they met a sorry end.\nNow tell me about the women in this household—both those\nwhose conduct dishonors me, and those that are innocent.”\nThen his dear nurse Eurykleia responded to him, saying:\n“Very well, my child: I’ll tell you the truth of the matter.\nFifty women there are that live here in your halls,\nhandmaids we taught to perform their various tasks,\ncarding the wool while enduring a lifetime of servitude:\nof these there are twelve who chose the path of shamelessness,\nshowing no respect for me or Penelope herself—\nTelemachos, though, only lately came of age: his mother\nhasn’t allowed him control over the women servants.\nBut now, please, let me go to that bright upper chamber\nand break the news to your wife, whom some god’s kept asleep.”\nTo her resourceful Odysseus then responded, saying:\n“No, don’t wake her yet. But go and tell those women\nwho’ve been guilty of shameful behavior to come in here, to me.”\nSo he spoke. The old woman went out through the hall\nto bring the women his message, and order them to come;\nwhile Odysseus summoned Telemachos, as well as the cowherd\nand swineherd, and addressed them with winged words, saying:\n“Start removing the corpses now. Get the women to help you.\nThen have them clean off these elegant chairs and tables,\nwashing them down with water, using porous sponges.\nWhen you’ve put the whole hall in proper order, then\ntake these maidservants out of the well-built hall, to a spot\nmidway between the round house and the courtyard’s flawless wall,\nand cut them up with your long sharp swords till you’ve taken\nthe life from them all and they’ve forgotten their Aphrodisiac\npleasures under the suitors, lying with them clandestinely.”\nAs he spoke, the women arrived in a body, all sobbing\ndesperately, all shedding big tears. So first of all\nthey bore out the bodies of the slain, and stacked them\nunder the colonnade of the well-walled courtyard,\npropped up against one another, while Odysseus directed\ntheir work himself, hurrying them. They were forced to carry\nthe corpses. Then they cleaned off the elegant chairs and tables,\nwashing them down with water, using porous sponges.\nTelemachos meanwhile, with the cowherd and the swineherd,\nscraped off the floor of the close-built house with shovels,\nand the women collected the scrapings, deposited them outside.\nThen, when they’d put the whole hall in proper order,\nthey took the maidservants out of that well-built hall, to a spot\nmidway between the round house and the courtyard’s flawless wall,\nand shut them in a tight corner, with no possible escape.\nSagacious Telemachos now spoke first to the others, saying:\n“A clean death isn’t the way by which I want to end\nthese women’s lives: they poured insults on my own head\nand my mother’s too, all while they were sleeping with the suitors.”\nSo he spoke, and taking the cable of a dark-prowed vessel,\nhitched one end to a tall pillar, the other about the round house,\nstretching it high, so no woman could touch the ground with her feet.\nAs when long-winged thrushes or doves are caught in the snare\nthat’s been set for them in a thicket, as they’re flying back\nto their roosts, and hateful the bed that now welcomes them,\nthese women’s heads bobbed in a line, and round their necks\nnooses were set for all, to give them most piteous deaths:\nthey jerked with their feet a little, but not for long.\nThen they brought Melanthios out, through the forecourt and yard,\nand cut off his nose and ears with the pitiless bronze,\nand ripped out his private parts for the dogs to eat raw,\nand in their fury chopped off his hands and his feet.\nThat done, they washed their own hands and feet, and went\ninto the house to Odysseus, and their work was over.\nBut he now addressed his dear nurse Eurykleia, saying:\n“Bring sulfur, old woman, that cleanses pollution, and bring me\nfire, to make fumes that will purge the hall; then tell\nPenelope to come down now, she and her handmaids,\nand have all the women servants in the house assemble here.”\nThen his dear nurse Eurykleia responded to him, saying:\n“Yes indeed, my child, all this you’ve requested is in order.\nBut please, let me bring you a mantle and tunic to wear—\ndon’t stand like that in your hall with your broad shoulders\nclad only in rags: that would be just cause for censure.”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to her, saying:\n“First of all, see that a fire is lit for me in the hall.”\nSo he spoke; and his dear nurse Eurykleia did not\ndisregard him, but fetched fire and sulfur; and Odysseus\nthoroughly purified hall and house and courtyard. Then\nthe old woman went back through Odysseus’ fine domain\nto bring word to the women, and order them to assemble;\nand out they came from their quarters, torches in their hands,\nand crowded round Odysseus, and embraced him,\nand clasped and kissed his head and his hands and shoulders\nin affectionate greeting, and a sweet longing possessed him\nfor crying and tears: each one of them was familiar to him.\n",

         "\nChuckling, the old woman ascended to the upper chamber,\nto bring her mistress the news that her dear husband was there,\nin the house: her feet hobbled, but her knees moved briskly,\nand she stood at Penelope’s head, and addressed her, saying:\n“Wake up, Penelope, dear child, so you may see\nwith your own eyes what you’ve longed for all this time!\nOdysseus is here, back at last, late though his return!\nHe’s slaughtered the haughty suitors who were preying on\nhis household, devouring his property, bullying his son!”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to her, saying:\n“Dear granny, the gods have crazed you—those who are able\nto change even the sharpest-witted into a nitwit, or take\na halfwit and set him well on the road to wisdom!\nIt’s they who’ve crazed you—you, who were once so sensible!\nWhy do you mock me thus, when my heart’s full of sorrow,\ntalking in that wild way, arousing me from sleep—\nsweet sleep, that bound me fast, enfolded my eyelids? Never\nhave I slept so soundly since that day when Odysseus\nleft to set eyes on ill Ilion—that unspeakable name!\nOff with you now, back down to the women’s quarters—\nand if any other woman, of all those who belong to me,\nhad come to me with this story, and woken me up, for sure\nI’d have quickly sent her packing, back downstairs,\nin a way she’d regret! But here your old age shall save you.”\nEurykleia, loyal nurse, then responded to her, saying:\n“Dear child, I’m not mocking you! What I said is the truth!\nOdysseus is here, back home, exactly as I informed you:\nthe stranger that all the men were insulting in the feast hall—\nthat’s him! Telemachos learned who he was a while back,\nbut he was discreet, kept his father’s plans well hidden\ntill he could punish the violence of these overbearing men.”\nSo she spoke. Rejoicing, Penelope sprang from her bed,\nand hugged the old woman, shedding tears from her eyelids,\nand, uttering winged words, addressed her, saying:\n“Come now, dear granny, please will you tell me truly,\nif he’s in fact come back home, as you say, how he contrived\nto lay hands on this crowd of shameless suitors—alone,\nwhile they always stay together when they’re in this house.”\nEurykleia, loyal nurse, then responded to her, saying:\n“I neither saw nor was told of it. I only heard the groaning\nof men being killed. We sat, terrified, at the back\nof our well-built quarters, behind the close-fitting doors,\nuntil your son came in from the hall and called us—\nhis father had sent Telemachos over to fetch us out.\nI found Odysseus standing among the slaughtered corpses:\nthey lay all around him, filled the hard-trodden floor,\nheaped on each other. To see him would have warmed your heart—\nall bespattered with blood and gore, like a lion, he was!\nAll the bodies are now collected at the gates of the courtyard,\nin one pile, and he’s purifying his fine home with sulfur,\nafter kindling a large fire. He’s sent me to summon you.\nSo come, that the hearts of you both may enter upon\ntrue happiness, after all the troubles that you’ve endured!\nNow at long last what you hoped for has been fulfilled:\nhe’s come back himself, alive, to his own hearth, and found\nboth you and his son in his halls. As for those who mistreated him,\nthe suitors, he’s been revenged on all of them in his house!”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to her, saying: “Dear granny,\ndon’t laugh out loud, don’t exult in triumph over them yet:\nyou know how welcome his appearance here in these halls\nwould be to us all, but most to me, and the son born to us.\nBut this is no true account, the way you tell it: no,\nsome immortal’s slaughtered the haughty suitors, in wrath\nat their heartbreaking wantonness and their wicked deeds;\nfor they had no respect for any dwellers upon this earth\nwhether high or low, whoever might come among them;\nso they’ve come to grief through their own mad folly. But Odysseus\nhas lost, far away, his return to Achaia—and his life.”\nEurykleia, loyal nurse, then responded to her, saying:\n“My child, what’s this word that’s escaped the barrier of your teeth,\nsaying your husband—who’s here, by the hearth downstairs!—\nwill never return home? Your heart’s always so mistrustful!\nLook, here’s another clear proof that I’ll now tell you: the scar\nfrom that wound the white tusk of a boar dealt him long ago:\nI saw it while washing his feet, and wanted to break the news\nto you yourself, but he put his hand over my mouth\nand in his great shrewdness of mind wouldn’t let me tell you.\nSo come with me now, and I’ll put my own life at hazard:\nif I’m deceiving you, kill me, in the most painful manner!”\nTo her prudent Penelope responded, saying: “Dear granny,\nit’s hard for you to fathom the thoughts of the gods\neternal, however intelligent you may be. Even so,\nlet’s go down and join my son, for me to see these men,\nthe suitors, dead, and whoever it was that killed them.”\nSo saying, she set off downstairs, debating in her heart\nwhether to keep at a distance from—her own dear husband?\nor rather go to him, clasp his head and hands and kiss them?\nBut when she’d come in, passing over the stone threshold,\nshe sat down facing Odysseus, in the light from the fire,\nby the opposite wall. He was sitting against a tall pillar,\nlooking down, and waiting to see if his comely bedfellow\nwould make any comment when she’d had a good look at him.\nBut she sat long in silence, heart possessed by wonder,\nnow with her eyes scrutinizing his face intensely,\nthen failing to recognize him in the mean rags he wore.\nTelemachos took her to task, and addressed her, saying:\n“Mother, my cruel mother, so unyielding at heart,\nwhy do you thus hold back from my father? Why not sit\nbeside him, interrogate him, ask him questions?\nNo other woman would thus, with obdurate heart,\nhold aloof from a husband who, much hardship suffered,\nhad, in the twentieth year, come back to his own country;\nbut your heart is always harder than any stone.”\nTo him\nPrudent Penelope now responded, saying: “My child,\nthe heart in my breast is lost in wonder, I cannot\nfind words with which to address or question him,\nor look him straight in the face. But if in actual truth\nhe’s Odysseus, come back home, then undoubtedly we two\npossess better ways of recognizing each other:\nsigns known only to us—no one else has access to them.”\nSo she spoke. Noble much-enduring Odysseus smiled,\nand at once addressed Telemachos with winged words, saying:\n“Telemachos, let your mother now make trial of me here,\nin my own domain: soon enough she’ll understand much better.\nBut at present, because I’m filthy, and clad in mean clothing,\nshe treats me with disrespect, won’t yet say I am he.\nFor now, we need to consider how best to settle matters.\nA man who’s killed only a single soul in his district,\neven one without many to avenge him when he’s gone,\nstill flees into exile, abandoning kin and country;\nbut we’ve slain the city’s mainstay, the very noblest\nof the youths on Ithake: this you need to bear in mind.”\nSagacious Telemachos then responded to him, saying:\n“Look to it yourself, dear father: they say yours is the best\ncounsel of all mankind, that there’s no other mortal,\nnot one living person, that could compete with you!\nAs for us, we’ll follow you eagerly, and I don’t think\nwe’ll fall short in prowess, insofar as we have the power.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“So, I shall tell you the best course as I see it.\nFirst all go and wash yourselves, then put on tunics,\nand tell the maids in their quarters to choose their dresses,\nand let the godlike minstrel with his clear-toned lyre\nact as our leader in the pleasures of dancing,\nso that any person outside who hears the sounds—\na neighbor or passerby—will assume it’s a wedding-feast.\nThat way the news of the slaughter of these suitors\nwon’t spread abroad through the district before we’ve gone\nout to our wooded farmstead, where we can then\nestablish whatever advantage the Olympian may grant us.”\nSo he spoke. They all were listening, and readily obeyed him.\nFirst they went and washed and put on their tunics,\nand the women decked themselves out, and the godlike minstrel\ntook up his hollow lyre, and aroused a longing in them\nfor the pleasures of song and fine dancing. So the great hall\nresounded all about with the noise made by the feet\nof dancing men, and well-dressed women, and thus\nmight a person outside the house who heard them declare:\n“For sure, someone must have married the much-wooed queen!\nHard-hearted she was, had no stomach to keep her wedded\nhusband’s domain right through, until he returned.”\nSo they’d say,\nbut knew nothing of the events that had in fact taken place.\nSo now great-hearted Odysseus was washed in his own house\nby his housekeeper, Eurynome: she massaged him with oil,\nand dressed him in an elegant mantle and a tunic,\nwhile over his body Athene shed an abundance of beauty,\nmaking him taller and sturdier, and from his pate\nshe conjured hair, thick and curling, like the hyacinth blossom.\nAs happens when some craftsman overlays silver with gold—\nan expert, to whom Hephaistos and Pallas Athene have taught\nevery kind of technique, to embellish the works he creates—\nso she now shed grace over his head and shoulders,\nand he came from the bath in appearance like the immortals,\nand sat down again on the chair from which he’d risen,\nfacing his wife; and he then addressed her, saying:\n“Strange lady, to you, beyond all womankind, those\nwho make their home on Olympos have given a stubborn spirit!\nNo other woman would thus, with obdurate heart\nhold aloof from the husband who, much hardship suffered,\nhad, in the twentieth year, come back to his own country!\nWell, granny, spread me a bed, so that I can settle down\nhere by myself, for the heart in her breast is of iron.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Strange sir, I’m being neither haughty nor indifferent,\nnor am I oversurprised. I know well what you looked like\nwhen you sailed from Ithake in that long-oared ship of yours.\nCome then, Eurykleia, make up the solid bedstead for him,\noutside the well-built bedroom that he himself constructed!\nThere set the solid bedstead, and put bedding on it—\nfleeces, blankets, bright coverlets.”\nSo she spoke,\nmaking trial of her husband. But Odysseus in response\nburst out in anger, and addressed his true wife, saying:\n“Woman, this word you’ve said embitters my heart!\nWho’s moved my bed elsewhere? A hard job that would be,\neven for a skilled worker, unless some god came down\nin person, and chose to shift it: easy enough for him!\nBut of mortals no man alive, however young and strong,\ncould dislodge it, for a great token was embodied\nin the bed that I fashioned—I, and no other man! There was\na small long-leafed olive-tree that grew there in the courtyard,\nflourishing, in its prime. Its girth was like a pillar.\nRound this I built our chamber, till it was finished,\nwith close-set stones, and a sound roof overhead,\nand dovetailed doors I added, made to fit closely; then\nI lopped off the foliage of the long-leafed olive, trimmed\nthe trunk from the root up, made it smooth it with a bronze\nadze, well and expertly, shaped it true to the line,\nmaking it into a bedpost, bored holes in it with my auger.\nBeginning with that, I worked till I’d finished the whole bed,\nadorned it with inlays—gold, silver, ivory—then latticed\nthe bed frame with thongs of oxhide, dyed bright purple.\nThus I describe this token to you—though I’ve no idea\nif this bed of mine’s still in place, wife, or whether by now\nsome man’s severed the olive’s trunk, and moved it elsewhere.”\nSo he spoke. Her knees and heart were undone on the spot,\nsince well she knew the sure tokens that Odysseus had described.\nThen she ran straight to him in tears, and flung her arms\nabout his neck, kissed his face, and addressed him, saying:\n“Don’t be angry with me, Odysseus! In all other matters\nyou’ve been the wisest of men—the gods it was brought us grief,\nbegrudging that we two should remain one with the other,\nenjoy our joint life together from youth to the brink of old age.\nBut please don’t now get cross or take me to task because\nat first sight I didn’t, as now, give you a loving welcome!\nThe heart in my breast was always terrified lest some man\nmight turn up here, beguile me with his specious story—\nmany there are who scheme for their own low profit!\nNot even Argive Helen, Zeus’ progeny, would have coupled\nin love and bed with that foreigner had she but known\nthe Achaians’ warlike sons were going to fetch her back\nto her own home and country. In her case a god\nincited her to commit her improper act: not till then\ndid she put in her mind that ghastly act of mad folly,\nthat first brought such grief upon us as well. But now—\nsince you’ve already recounted, clear and plain, the tokens\nof this bed of ours, seen by no other living mortal\nexcept you and me alone, and one solitary handmaid,\nAktor’s daughter, a gift from my father, before I came here,\nthe doorkeeper of our close-built bridal chamber now—\nyou’ve convinced my heart, all too stubborn though it was.”\nSo she spoke, and stirred in his heart yet more the urge to cry,\nand he wept as he held in his arms his loyal beloved wife,\nand welcome as is the appearance of dry land to men swimming,\nmen whose strong ship Poseidon has wrecked out on the deep,\nas it’s driven on by the gale and the cresting waves,\nand few have made it to land out of the grey salt sea\nby swimming, and thick is the brine that’s crusted on their bodies,\nand glad they are to have got ashore, and escaped disaster—\nso welcome to her was her husband as she looked upon him,\nnever relaxing the hold of her white arms round his neck.\nIndeed, rosy-fingered Dawn would have risen while they wept\nhad the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, not planned things otherwise.\nThe night’s last stage she prolonged, while holding up\ngolden-throned Dawn at Ocean, and not permitting her\nto yoke up her swift-footed horses, bringing light to mankind—\nPhaethon and Lampos, the colts that draw Dawn’s chariot.\nThen resourceful Odysseus addressed his wife, saying: “Not yet\nhave we reached the conclusion, my wife, of all our trials:\nthere’s a measureless task still awaiting us in the future,\nboth long and hard: I need to accomplish this in full.\nThat’s what the ghost of Teiresias prophesied to me\non the day I ventured down into the realm of Hades\nto enquire about my comrades’ homecoming, and my own.\nBut come, my wife, let’s to bed, so that now, at last, soothed\nby sweet sleep, we may find our joy and comfort together.”\nThen prudent Penelope responded to him, saying:\n“Your bed shall be ready for you whenever your heart\nis so inclined, now the gods have managed your return\nto your well-built home, and to your native country:\nbut since you’ve thought of this, and a god’s put it in your mind,\ntell me what this trial is—I fancy I’ll learn its nature\nsoon enough: no bad thing to know of it in advance.”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to her, saying:\n“Strange lady, why do you now so urgently want me\nto tell you this? Well, I’ll do so, I’ll keep nothing secret.\nBut your heart will get no joy of it, nor am I myself\nhappy about it. Teiresias said I must travel to numerous\ncities of men, while holding a well-shaped oar in my hands,\nuntil I come among men who know nothing of the sea,\nwho eat their food without flavoring it with salt\nand have never set eyes on ships with purple cheeks\nor on the well-shaped oars that serve as a ship’s wings;\nand he told me a manifest sign, one that wouldn’t escape me:\nwhen on the road I encounter another man who believes\nwhat I have on my sturdy shoulder is a winnowing-fan,\nI’m to fix my well-shaped oar on end in the ground,\nand offer a lavish sacrifice to the lord Poseidon—\na ram, a bull, and a stud boar that mounts its sows.\nI then must come back home, make rich sacred offerings\nto the immortal gods who possess broad heaven,\nin due order. Death will come to me from the sea,\nthe gentlest of ends, that will take me only when\nI’ve worn out a sleek old age, with my people round me\nprospering. All of this, he told me, would come to pass.”\nPrudent Penelope then responded to him, saying:\n“If indeed the gods are allowing you a better old age,\nthen there’s hope that we’ll get a chance to escape our troubles.”\nSuch was the conversation between them. All this while\nthe nurse and Eurynome were making up their bed\nwith soft bedclothes, under the light of flaming torches;\nand when they’d hastily readied the solid bedstead,\nthe old nurse went off to sleep in her own quarters,\nwhile Eurynome, maid of the bedchamber, conducted them\non their way to bed, holding a torch on her hand.\nAfter escorting them there she too retired, while they\nhappily rediscovered the world of their old-time bed.\nTelemachos and the cowherd and the swineherd now\nstopped their feet from dancing, stopped the women too,\nand lay down to sleep themselves, in the shadowy halls.\nWhen the couple had had their fill of passionate lovemaking,\nthey got pleasure from conversation, chatting to one another.\nShe, bright among women, told of all she’d borne in the halls,\nhaving to watch the destructive crowd of suitors, those who,\nwith her as excuse, had slaughtered many cattle and fat sheep,\nwhile too much wine was drawn from the storage jars; while he,\nZeus-born Odysseus, recounted all the woes he’d inflicted\non others, and all he’d endured with pain himself;\nand she heard him out with delight, and sweet sleep never\nwas shed on her eyelids until his whole tale was told.\nHe began with how he’d first overcome the Kikones,\nthen came to the rich terrain of the lotus-eating men;\nand all that the Kyklops did, and the price he made him pay\nfor those of his sturdy comrades he’d pitilessly devoured;\nand then how he came to Aiolos, who readily welcomed him,\nand gave him conveyance—but he was not yet fated to reach\nhis own land: once again the storm wind snatched him up\nand bore him, heavily groaning, over the fish-rich deep;\nthen how he’d come to Telepylos, where the Laistrygonians\ndestroyed his ships and all his well-greaved comrades,\nOdysseus alone escaping in his black ship. He next\nrecounted all of Kirke’s deceits and contrivances,\nhow he’d gone in his many-oared ship to Hades’ dank domain,\nto consult the spirit of Theban Teiresias; and how\nthere he’d seen every one of his former companions,\nbesides the mother who bore him, and nursed him as a child;\nhow he’d heard the voice of the Sirens, unceasing singers;\nhow he’d come to the Wandering Rocks, and to dread Charybdis\nand Skylle, from whom till then no man had escaped unscathed;\nand how his comrades had slaughtered the cattle of Helios;\nand how his swift ship had been struck by a smoldering bolt\nfrom high-thundering Zeus, and his fine comrades died together,\nall of them: he alone got clear of the grim death spirits;\nhow he came to the isle of Ogygia and the nymph Kalypso,\nwho kept him there, longing to have him as her husband,\nin her hollow caves, and looked after him, and declared\nshe would make him immortal and ageless all his days,\nyet never could win over the heart in his breast; and how\nafter many hardships endured he reached the Phaiakians,\nwho treated him with high honor, as though he were a god,\nand conveyed him home in a ship to his native country\nwith presents of bronze and gold and apparel. This concluded\nthe tale as he told it and was when sweet limb-loosening\nsleep sprang on him, dissolving his heart’s anxieties.\nThe grey-eyed goddess Athene now had another idea.\nWhen she figured Odysseus had had his fill of pleasure\nfrom bedding his wife and sleeping, she at once aroused\nfrom Ocean the Dawn, early risen and golden-throned,\nto bring light to mankind; and now Odysseus arose\nfrom his soft bed, and gave a charge to Penelope, saying:\n“My wife, by now we’ve had a surfeit of endless trials,\nboth of us, you here weeping over my troubled homecoming,\nwhile Zeus and the other deities hobbled me with hardships\nfar from my own country, though I longed to be back!\nBut now we’ve come at last to the marriage bed we yearned for,\nyou’ll care for such possessions as I have here in the halls;\nand as for the flocks that these haughty suitors have wasted,\nI’ll get a good many by raiding, and others that the Achaians\nwill give me, until we’ve replenished every last empty stall!\nMy first task now is to visit my wooded farmstead and see\nmy sturdy old father, who’s so distressed on my account.\nAnd on you, wife, I lay this charge, as a sensible woman:\nBeginning at sunrise the word will very soon get around\nconcerning these men, the suitors, whom I slew in our halls;\nso both you and your women servants must go upstairs\nto your chamber and sit there: no peeping, don’t ask questions.”\nThat said, he arranged his fine armor about his shoulders,\nwoke up Telemachos and the cowherd and the swineherd,\nand ordered them all to lay hands on their war gear. They\ndid not disregard him, but donned their bronze body armor,\nand opened the doors and went out, with Odysseus leading.\nLight already was over the earth, but Athene concealed them\nin darkness, and led them out quickly from the city.\n",

         "\nHermes, god of Kyllene, now summoned forth the ghosts\nof the men who’d been suitors: he held the staff in his hands—\nexquisite, golden—with which he bemuses the eyes\nof those he wishes, while others he conjures out of their sleep.\nThis he used to herd and to lead them: they followed him, squeaking.\nAs in the furthest recesses of some vast cave the bats\nflit about squeaking when one of them falls down the rock face\nfrom the chain they form, clinging closely one to another,\nso these went along with him, squeaking. Hermes the healer\nconducted them down dank and moldering pathways:\nby the streams of Ocean they went, and the White Rock,\nthey went by the gates of the sun and the region of dreams,\nand quickly they now arrived at the meadow of asphodels,\nwhere ghosts dwell, the shades of those whose toils are over.\nThere they found the ghost of Peleus’ son Achilles,\nand those of Patroklos and of peerless Antilochos,\nand of Aias, unmatched for handsomeness and stature\namong all the Danaans, save for Peleus’ peerless son.\nSo these gathered round Achilles. Close to them now\nthere came the ghost of Atreus’ son Agamemnon,\ngrieving; and round him clustered the ghosts of all those\nwho’d died and met their fate with him in Aigisthos’ house;\nand the first ghost to address him was the son of Peleus, saying:\n“Son of Atreus, we had this belief that Zeus, the hurler of bolts,\nloved you above other heroes, for all your days, because\nyou were lord over many brave men out there in the land\nof the Trojans, where we Achaians suffered much hardship.\nYet on you as well there was fated to come too early\nthat deadly destiny which no mortal born can avoid—\nWould that, while still enjoying your royal power,\nyou’d encountered your death and fate in Trojan country!\n“Then all the Achaians would have made you a burial mound,\nand great glory would have been yours, and your son’s, hereafter,\nwhereas now you’ve been doomed to suffer a most piteous death.”\nThen the ghost of the son of Atreus responded to him, saying:\n“Ah, fortunate son of Peleus, godlike Achilles: you died\nout at Troy, far from Argos, and around you others were slain,\nthe finest sons of the Trojans and the Achaians,\nfighting over your body; amid the swirling dust\ngreat in your greatness you lay, your horsemanship forgotten.\nThat whole day we battled; we’d never have quit fighting\nhad Zeus not unleashed a hurricane, and stopped us.\nBut when we’d carried you out of the battle to the ships,\nwe laid you on a litter, and cleansed your splendid body\nwith warm water and unguents, and the Danaans shed\nmany warm tears over you, cut off locks of their hair.\nYour mother came up from the sea with her immortal sea nymphs\nwhen she heard the news: a cry echoed over the deep,\na strange cry, and panic now seized on all the Achaians:\nthey’d have taken off and run for it, back to the hollow ships,\nhad they not been checked by a man versed in ancient wisdom—\nNestor: even before this his counsel had seemed the best.\nHe with friendly intent now addressed the assembly, saying:\n‘Stop this, you Argives! Don’t flee, you Achaian youths!\nIt’s his mother, come from the sea with her immortal sea nymphs\nin her concern for the death of her own son.’\n“So he spoke,\nand the great-hearted Achaians abandoned their panic flight.\nRound you gathered the daughters of the Old Man of the Sea\nlamenting piteously, wrapped you in ambrosial clothing;\nall the Nine Muses with their sweet antiphonal voices\nnow led the dirge—there wasn’t a single tearless Argive\nto be seen, so deeply did the clear-toned Muse affect them.\nSo for seventeen days, by night as well as by day,\nwe mourned you, immortal gods and mortal men together;\nthen on the eighteenth we surrendered you to the fire,\nand many fat sheep and crumple-horned oxen we slaughtered\naround you; you were burned in the gods’ own clothing\nwith a wealth of sweet honey and unguents: many Achaian heroes\nfooted it round the pyre in their war gear while you burned,\nfoot soldiers and horsemen both: a great clamor arose.\nBut when Hephaistos’ flames had finished their work,\nat dawn we collected your white bones, Achilles,\nin unmixed wine and fine oil. Your mother had given us\na golden two-handled jar: a present from Dionysos,\nshe said, and the work of renowned Hephaistos. In this\nyour white bones now lie, illustrious Achilles,\nmingled with those of dead Patroklos, Menoitios’ son;\nseparate are those of Antilochos, whom you honored\nabove all your comrades, save only dead Patroklos. Over them\nwe heaped up a huge and matchless burial mound—\nwe, the sacred army of Argive spearmen—on\na prominent headland by the broad Hellespont,\nto be visible far out at sea both to men now living\nand those yet unborn hereafter. And your mother\nsought and obtained from the gods most exquisite prizes\nand set them in mid-arena to be won by the best Achaians.\nBefore now you’ve been present at the funeral games of many\nheroes, when on the occasion of a king’s demise\nyoung men gird themselves up and prepare to compete\nfor prizes; had you seen these ones you’d have been astounded\nby the sheer beauty of the prizes the goddess, silver-footed\nThetis, set up in your honor: most dear to the gods you were!\nSo not even in death did you lose your name, but forever\nyour noble renown, Achilles, shall be known to all mankind.\nBut what pleasure had I from this—that I wound up the war?\nFor on my return Zeus contrived me a most miserable end,\nat the hands of Aigisthos and my accursed wife.”\nSuch was the conversation between them, one to the other.\nThe Escort, the slayer of Argos, now approached them,\nleading down the ghosts of those suitors whom Odysseus had killed;\nThe two, amazed by the sight, went straight to meet them.\nThe ghost of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, recognized\nMelaneus’ dear son, far-famed Amphimedon, who\nhad his home on Ithake, and whose guest-friend he’d once been.\nAtreus’ son was the first to speak, and addressed him, saying:\n“Amphimedon, what befell you, all picked men of like age,\nto bring you here, down below the dark earth? Not otherwise\nwould one make one’s list if selecting the best men in the city!\nWas it Poseidon destroyed you aboard your vessels\nby stirring up the dread blast of hard-blowing gales?\nOr did hostile men work your destruction on dry land\nwhen you were lifting their cattle and fine fleecy sheep\nor fighting them for their city and for their women?\nAnswer my question! I declare that I’m your guest-friend—\nDon’t you recall the time I came there to your house\nwith godlike Menelaos, to persuade Odysseus\nto accompany us to Ilion on the well-benched ships?\nA whole month the journey took us, crossing the broad deep,\nfor hard it was to persuade Odysseus the city-sacker.”\nThen the ghost of Amphimedon responded to him, saying:\n“Most glorious son of Atreus, Agamemnon, king of men,\nI recall these events, Zeus’ nursling, just as you recount them;\nand now I in turn shall tell you, truthfully and in full,\nwhat led to our nasty death, how the whole thing happened.\nWe were courting the wife of the long-absent Odysseus:\nshe neither rejected nor made this marriage that she hated,\nbut—while planning death and black fate for us—\nprivately conceived this other trick in her mind.\nIn her halls she set up a great loom, and started weaving—\nvery broad was the web, fine of thread—and said to us then:\n‘You young men, my suitors now noble Odysseus is dead,\nbe patient, though eager to wed me, until I finish\nthis web: I should not want my woven work to be wasted—\na shroud for the hero Laertes, against that day\nwhen the grim fate of pitiless death shall overtake him:\nthen the local Achaian women won’t be able to blame me\nfor a man who’d won so much being left with no winding-sheet.’\n“So she spoke; our proud hearts assented to what she said.\nFrom then on, day after day, she’d be weaving at the great loom,\nbut at night she’d have torches set up, and undo her work.\nThus for three years she beguiled and persuaded the Achaians;\nbut when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round,\nand the months wore away, and day after day passed by,\nthen one of her women, who knew the truth, informed us,\nand we caught her undoing her work at that splendid loom.\nSo she finished it off perforce, though against her will,\nand showed it to us when she’d woven it on the great web\nand washed it: it shone like the sun or the moon. It was then\nthat some evil spirit brought Odysseus from who knows where\nto the border of his estate, where the swineherd lived.\nThither too there came the dear son of godlike Odysseus,\non his way back in his black ship from sandy Pylos;\nand the two of them, after planning a nasty death for the suitors,\nreturned to the famous town, Odysseus later,\nbut Telemachos going on ahead of him. Now the swineherd\nbrought in Odysseus, meanly garbed, and made\nto look like a miserable beggar, of a great age\nand propped on a staff. The clothes he wore were ragged.\nNo man among us, not even the older ones, when he\nappeared out of nowhere could tell who he really was:\nwe all assailed him with insults, threw things at him.\nHe for a while, set firm in his purpose, put up\nwith being pelted and taunted there his own domain;\nbut when the intent of Zeus of the aegis stirred him,\nwith Telemachos’ help he removed all the first-class war gear,\nstowed it away in a storeroom and bolted the door.\nThen, in his crafty planning, he instructed his wife to set\nbefore the suitors his bow and the grey iron, as a contest—\nand the beginning of death—for us ill-fated men.\nNot one of us was able to draw and notch the string\nof his powerful bow: we all fell far short of that.\nBut when the great bow was passed into Odysseus’ hands,\nthen we all of us made a great outcry, shouted aloud\nnot to give him the bow, whatever he might say.\nOnly Telemachos urged him on, and told him to try it.\nSo the noble much-enduring Odysseus grasped the bow,\nand easily strung it, and sent an arrow through the iron.\nThen he went and stood on the threshold, and emptied out\nhis swift shafts, glancing round fiercely, and shot the prince\nAntinoos, then let fly at the others his hurtful arrows,\ntaking sure aim. The men fell thick and fast, and now\nit became very clear that some god was his helper,\nfor suddenly sallying forth they raged from room to room\nkilling men on all sides, and a ghastly clamor went up\nas heads were stove in, and the whole floor ran with blood.\nSo we all died, Agamemnon; and even now our bodies\nare still lying there, uncared-for, in the halls of Odysseus,\nsince the dear ones in each man’s home as yet know nothing of it—\nthose who’d wash the black gore away from our wounds,\nand lay us out, keening: the proper privilege of the dead.”\nThen the ghost of the son of Atreus responded to him, saying:\n“Ah, fortunate son of Laertes, resourceful Odysseus!\nTruly endowed with great virtue was the bedfellow you won!\nHow excellent was the mind-set of Ikarios’ daughter,\nblameless Penelope, how well she remembered Odysseus,\nher wedded husband! And so the renown of her great virtue\nshall never perish, because the immortals shall make a charming\nsong for men here on earth, about constant Penelope!\nNot such was Tyndareus’ daughter, who did a wicked deed,\nkilling her wedded husband: loathsome the song about her\nleft to posterity, and vile the repute she bequeathed\nto all womankind, even those who conduct was virtuous.”\nSuch was the conversation they had with one another,\nstanding in Hades’ domain, deep down below the earth.\nThe others now, leaving the city, soon arrived at Laertes’\nfarmstead, fine and well-cultivated, which he’d acquired\nlong ago, and heavy the labor that he’d expended on it.\nThis was his home. All round it ran the outhouses in which\nthere ate, sat, and slept those who were his servants\nout of necessity, working at whatever he wanted. Inside\nthe house lived an old Sikel woman, who took good care\nof the old man himself, on his farmstead, far from the city.\nOdysseus addressed his servants and son, saying: “You go now\ninto his well-built house, and quickly choose and slaughter\nfor dinner the very best of the hogs; but as for me,\nI mean to make trial of my father, find out whether he\nwill recognize me, know who I am when he sees me,\nor fail to know me, since I’ve been away so long.”\nSo saying, he handed over his war gear to his servants.\nThey then hastened into the house, but Odysseus\nwent off to the flourishing vineyard to carry out his test.\nAs he entered the large orchard he did not find Dolios,\nor any of his slaves or his sons: they’d all gone off\ncollecting stones to make a wall for the vineyard,\nwith the old man leading the way. Instead he found\nhis father alone in the well-constructed vineyard,\ndigging around a plant, in a filthy tunic,\npatched and shabby, and round his shins he’d fastened\nstitched leggings of oxhide, to stop him getting scratched,\nwith gloves on his hands against the thorns, and above them\non his head a goatskin cap—all fostering his sorrow.\nWhen much-enduring noble Odysseus saw him thus,\nworn out by old age, and with great grief in his heart,\nstanding below a tall pear tree he shed tears, as he\ndebated in mind and heart what it was he should do next:\nshould he kiss and embrace his father, tell him all\nabout how he’d returned, come back to his own country;\nor should he first ask him questions, test him on details?\nAnd as he reflected, it struck him that this was the better course:\nto make trial of him to begin with, use bantering language.\nWith this in mind noble Odysseus went directly to him.\nLaertes, head down, was still digging around the plant:\nhis illustrious son came up and addressed him, saying:\n“Old man, you’ve no lack of skill, the way you tend this orchard!\nYou take good care of it all, there isn’t one thing here—\nplant or fig tree, vine, pear tree, olive, or even\nthe vegetable plot—that lacks proper cultivation!\nBut I do have to tell you, and please don’t take offense:\nyour person is not well cared for: you endure a wretched\nold age, you’re unpleasantly filthy, you wear foul clothes.\nWhy doesn’t your master look after you? Not, clearly, because\nyou’re idle! There’s nothing slavish about your appearance,\nin bearing or stature: you’re like a man who’s a king—\nthe kind of person who, when he’s bathed and eaten,\nshould sleep soft. And that’s the proper way for the old!\nNow come, tell me this, and answer me truthfully:\nWhat man’s servant are you? Whose orchard is this you tend?\nAnd tell me this truly also, so I may be certain:\nIs this really Ithake I’ve come to, as a man informed me\nwhom I encountered just now as I made my way here?\nHe wasn’t very clear-headed: he didn’t manage to tell me\nany particulars, or listen to what I said when I asked him\nabout a guest-friend of mine: does he still live, exist?\nOr is he dead already, and in Hades’ domain? I shall\nspeak plainly to you: pay attention and hear me out!\nI once, in my own country, entertained a man\nwho’d come to our house, and no other mortal yet\nof all remote-dwelling strangers was more welcome there.\nBy descent he was, he said, from Ithake: he told me\nhis own father was Laertes, the son of Arkeisios.\nI escorted him to our house, and welcomed him properly\nwith full entertainment from our rich household store;\nand I offered him gifts of guest-friendship, such as are fitting—\nof fine-wrought gold I bestowed on him seven talents,\nand a mixing-bowl all of silver, adorned with flowers,\na dozen plain cloaks, the same number of rugs and blankets,\nand as many beautiful mantles, with matching tunics;\nwomen I also gave him, skilled in fine handiwork,\nfour of them, very attractive, the ones he fancied himself.”\nThen his father responded to him, shedding tears:\n“Stranger, indeed you’ve come to the land about which you ask;\nbut outrageous and reckless men are now masters of it,\nand these countless gifts you bestowed were given in vain,\nfor if you’d found him alive in this land of Ithake\nhe’d have sent you on your way with ample gifts in exchange,\nafter generous entertainment, the due right of the one\nwho began it. Come, tell me this, and give me a truthful answer:\nHow many years is it now since you entertained that guest,\nyour unfortunate guest—my son, if he ever existed,\nmy ill-fated son! Far from friends and homeland, either\nfish have doubtless devoured him out in the deep, or else\nhe’s fallen prey on land to wild beasts and birds. Neither\nhis mother nor I, his parents, mourned and enshrouded him;\nnor did prudent Penelope, his well-dowered wife,\nkeen over her own husband, as was fitting, on his bier\nafter closing his eyes—the proper entitlement of the dead.\nAnd tell me this truly also, so I may be certain:\nWho are you? From where? What city? Who are your parents?\nWhere is the swift ship moored that brought you hither\nwith your godlike comrades? Or did you pay your passage\naboard another’s vessel, so they put you off, and sailed on?”\nThen resourceful Odysseus responded to him, saying:\n“I will give you a full and truthful account of these things.\nI come from Alybas, where I live in a well-known house,\nand I’m the son of Apheidas, Lord Polypemon’s son:\nmy own name is Eperitos. Some god drove me off course\nfrom Sikanie, landed me here against my will. My ship’s\nout there, beached off farmland, far distant from the city.\nBut as for Odysseus, this is now the fifth year since\nhe departed from there and left my native country—\nill-fated man! Yet he had good omens on setting out—\nbirds on the right: I was glad of them as I sent him on his way,\nand he was glad at departure. We both had high hopes\nof meeting again as guest-friends, and exchanging splendid gifts.”\nSo he spoke. A black cloud of grief now covered Laertes:\nwith both hands he gathered up the dark grimy dust,\npoured it over his grizzled head, ceaselessly groaning.\nOdysseus’ heart was stirred, and up through his nostrils\nrose a strong sharp pang as he looked at his dear father.\nHe sprang forward, embraced and kissed him, exclaiming: “Father,\nI myself, here, am the man about whom you ask,\ncome back in the twentieth year to my own country!\nSo stop your weeping and tearful lamentation,\nfor I’ll explain everything. But we urgently need to hurry—\nI’ve killed the suitors who were occupying our house,\nin revenge for their outrageous conduct and wicked acts.”\nThen Laertes responded to him, saying: “If it’s true\nthat you who’ve come here are indeed my son, Odysseus,\nthen give me some certain proof that will convince me.”\nTo him resourceful Odysseus responded, saying: “Firstly,\ntake a close look at this scar, from a wound I was dealt\nby the white tusk of a boar out up on Parnassos, when\nI went there because you sent me, you and my lady mother,\nto my mother’s father Autolykos, to collect the gifts\nhe’d agreed and promised to give me when he came here.\nLook, I’ll also tell you the trees that you once gave me\nin our well-laid-out orchard: I asked for each one as I\naccompanied you through the garden—I was still a child.\nIt was these very trees we passed by, and you named them for me,\nand told me about each one. Thirteen pear trees you gave me,\nten apple trees, forty fig trees. Rows of vines too you named,\nand promised me fifty of these, to ripen at different times,\nwith clusters of grapes upon them at every stage, depending\non when Zeus’ seasons brought them to their heaviest weight.”\nSo he spoke, and his father’s knees and heart gave way\nas he recognized the sure signs that Odysseus had given him.\nHe embraced his dear son; but then noble much-enduring\nOdysseus caught and held him close as he fainted. But when\nhe came round again, and the spirit revived in his breast,\nhe responded once more, and spoke, saying: “Zeus, Father,\nyou gods indeed still exist on high Olympos, if it’s true\nthat the suitors have paid the price for their wanton violence!\nBut now I’m terribly scared at heart that very soon all\nthe men of Ithake will come here against us, and send\nurgent messages out to the Kephallenian cities.”\nResourceful Odysseus now responded to him, saying:\n“Never fear, don’t let these matters disturb your mind!\nAnd now let’s go to your house near the orchard, for I sent\nTelemachos on ahead, with the cowherd and swineherd,\nto quickly prepare a meal there.”\nSo the two of them spoke,\nand now made their way to Laertes’ fine house; and when\nthey reached his pleasantly sited dwelling, there they found\nTelemachos and the cowherd and the swineherd\ncarving plentiful meat up and mixing the bright wine.\nNow great-hearted Laertes was bathed there in his house\nby the Sikel servant. She rubbed him down with oil,\nand dressed him in a fine mantle; and Athene stood close,\nand filled out the limbs of the shepherd of the people\nand made him of greater stature and sturdier to behold.\nOut of the bath he came, and his dear son was astonished\nto see him look so like the immortal gods; and he spoke,\nand addressed him with winged words, saying: “My father,\nit must be that one of the gods who are forever\nhas improved your looks, made you taller and more handsome!”\nThen sagacious Laertes responded to him, saying:\n“How I wish, by Zeus the Father, by Athene and Apollo,\nthat—as strong as I was when, as lord of the Kephallenians,\nI took Nerikos’ well-built citadel, on the mainland cape—\nin our domain yesterday, my armor about my shoulders,\nstanding beside you I’d helped to beat back those men,\nthe suitors! Then indeed I’d have unstrung the knees of many\nthere in your halls: the sight would have gladdened your heart.”\nSuch was the conversation between them, When the others\nhad finished their work, and the meal was made and ready,\nthey sat down in order on the benches and chairs. As they\nwere reaching their hands to the food, there now came in\nthe elderly Dolios, and with him the old man’s sons,\nall tired from their field work: their mother, old Sikel servant,\nhad gone out and called them in, she who’d brought them up,\nand took good care of Laertes, now great age was on him.\nThey, when they saw Odysseus, and realized who he was,\nstood still, in dumbstruck amazement. But Odysseus\nin conciliatory language now addressed them, saying:\n“Old man, sit you down to dinner, and you others, give over\nyour wonder—we wanted to start on the food, but we’ve\nbeen waiting a while, expecting you any moment.”\nSo he spoke; but Dolios made straight for him, with both\narms outstretched, caught and kissed Odysseus’ hand at the wrist,\nthen addressed him with winged words, saying: “Dear master,\nyou’re back! We missed you so much, we never thought\nwe’d see you again! The gods themselves brought you here!\nGood health to you, a warm welcome, may the gods bless you!\nOh, and tell me this truly, I want to be quite certain:\nDoes prudent Penelope already know for sure\nthat you’re back home, or shall we send her a messenger?”\nResourceful Odysseus then responded to him, saying:\n“She already knows, old man: what need for you to do this?”\nSo he spoke. Dolios sat down again on his polished chair.\nIn the same way, his sons now gathered round famous Odysseus\nmade him welcoming speeches and clasped his hands in theirs,\nand then sat down in order beside their father, Dolios.\nWhile they busied themselves with dinner, there in the hall,\nRumor the messenger sped through the city’s every quarter,\nreporting the hideous death and fate of the suitors. Those\nwho heard it now hurriedly gathered from all directions,\nsobbing and wailing, there in front of Odysseus’ domain.\nOut from it each of them fetched their own dead for burial,\nand all those from other cities they now sent homeward,\nin the charge of seamen aboard swift ships; they themselves\nwent, grieving at heart, in a body to the place of assembly.\nThen, when they were all assembled and met together,\nEupeithes stood up and addressed them, incurable sorrow\na great weight on his heart on account of his own son,\nAntinoos, the first man that noble Odysseus had slain.\nShedding tears for him, he now addressed the assembly, saying:\n“A foul act it was, my friends, that this man committed\nagainst the Achaians! Many fine men he took in his ships,\nand the hollow ships he lost, and the men all perished;\nand others, the best of the Kephallenians, he slaughtered\non his return. So come, before he runs away to Pylos\nor sacred Elis, where the Epeians hold sway,\nlet’s get going, or hereafter we shall be disgraced forever:\nthis matter will be a reproach for men yet unborn to hear of\nunless we’re revenged on the killers of our sons and brothers!\nFor me there would certainly be no pleasure in clinging\nto life—I’d rather die now, join the departed shades!\nSo lets get going, before they cross the sea and escape us.”\nSo he spoke, shedding tears. Pity seized on all the Achaians.\nThen they were joined by Medon and the godlike minstrel\nfrom Odysseus’ domain, for sleep had now let them go.\nThey stood there among them: amazement gripped every man.\nThen Medon, thoughtful and sensible, addressed them, saying:\n“Hear me out now, men of Ithake! Odysseus did not\nperform these deeds without the immortal gods’ support!\nI myself saw a deathless god, who stood beside him,\nin all ways resembling Mentor, yet as an immortal\ngod he appeared there, in front of Odysseus, now\nencouraging him; now again, alarming the suitors\nhe’d storm through the hall, and they fell thick and fast.”\nSo he spoke, and pale fear now seized upon them all.\nThen among them there spoke the aged hero Halitherses,\nson of Mastor: he alone saw both before and after.\nHe with friendly intent now addressed the assembly, saying:\n“Give a hearing, you men of Ithake, to what I shall tell you!\nIt’s your own fault, my friends, that all these actions happened!\nYou wouldn’t listen to me or to Mentor, the people’s shepherd,\nand make your sons give over their mindless stupidity!\nIn their criminal folly they perpetrated a monstrous wrong,\nsquandering the possessions and insulting the bedfellow\nof a most noble man, saying he would never return.\nLet it be this way, then, and do as I tell you: we should not\nstrike back—he that does might bring trouble upon himself.”\nSo he spoke. More than half of them now sprang to their feet\nin a great uproar—the rest stayed together where they were,—\nfor this speech aroused their displeasure, they were convinced\nby Eupeithes, so that now they rushed off for their armor,\nand when they’d clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze,\nthey assembled then in a body in front of the spacious town,\nwith Eupeithes in his folly leading them: he imagined\nhe was going to avenge his son’s murder. He was not destined\nto come back himself, but rather to meet his fate there.\nAthene now spoke to Zeus, the son of Kronos, saying:\n“Son of Kronos, our Father, supreme above all rulers,\nwill you answer my questions? What’s your mind now hiding?\nWill you promote further warfare and the vile din of battle,\nor rather make friendship between the opposing sides?”\nThen Zeus the cloud-gatherer responded to her, saying:\n“My child, why ask me questions about these matters?\nWas it not you yourself who thought up this whole plan,\nfor Odysseus to come home and be revenged on these men?\nSo, do as you please—but I’ll tell you what’s fitting. Now\nthat noble Odysseus has worked his vengeance on the suitors,\nthey must swear a solemn oath: let him be king for life,\nwhile as to the killing of their sons and brothers, let us\nenforce a forgetting of it. Let them, as previously,\nbe friends with each other; let wealth and peace abound.”\nSo saying, he roused Athene, who was eager already, and she\nwent on her way, darting down from Olympos’ heights.\nWhen his group had assuaged their desire for mind-honeying food,\nmuch-enduring noble Odysseus quickly spoke to them, saying:\n“Someone has to go out and see how near they’re getting.”\nSo he spoke. One of Dolios’ sons now went out, as he ordered,\nstood at the threshold and saw them, all close at hand,\nand at once addressed Odysseus with winged words, saying:\n“It’s them, they’re close! We need to arm ourselves at once!”\nSo he spoke; they stood up and donned their armor. Odysseus\nand his men were four, with the six sons of Dolios, while\nLaertes, and Dolios too, both armed themselves as well,\ngrey-haired though they were, now forced to be warriors.\nThen, when they’d clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze,\nthey opened the doors and went out. Odysseus led them.\nAthene, daughter of Zeus, now joined their company,\nlikening herself to Mentor in both voice and appearance.\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus rejoiced at he sight of her,\nand at once he addressed his dear son Telemachos, saying:\n“Telemachos, you’ll now learn for yourself—having come\nwhere battle picks out the truly best men fighting—\nnot in any way to disgrace your fathers’ ancestors, who\nlong ago excelled the world over in manly strength and valor.”\nSagacious Telemachos responded to him, saying:\n“You’ll see me, if you so wish, dear father—such is my spirit—\nin no way, as you say, disgracing your ancestry.”\nSo he spoke. Laertes was glad, and made this declaration:\n“What a great day for me, you kind gods! I’ve joy past measure!\nHere are my son and my grandson contending over valor!”\nGrey-eyed Athene now came up and addressed him, saying:\n“Ah, son of Arkeisios, of all my friends the dearest,\npray first to the grey-eyed maiden and to Zeus her father,\nthen at once whirl up your far-shadowing spear and throw it!”\nSo spoke Pallas Athene, and breathed great strength into him.\nHe made his prayer to Pallas Athene, and at once\nwhirled up his far-shadowing spear, and threw it, and struck\nEupeithes through the bronze cheek piece of his helmet,\nwhich did not hold up the spear: the bronze passed through,\nand he fell with a thud, and his war gear clattered on him.\nThen on their front rank fell Odysseus and his illustrious son,\nstriking at them with swords and twin-edged spears.\nAnd now they’d have killed them all, cut them off from home,\nhad not Athene, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus,\nshouted aloud, and stopped dead all the combatants, saying:\n“Cease this disastrous warfare, you men of Ithake,\nso you may part the sooner, and without bloodshed.”\nSo spoke Athene, and pale fear now seized upon them.\nIn their abject terror the arms now flew from their hands\nand dropped to the ground as the goddess uttered these words,\nand they turned toward the city, longing to save their lives.\nMuch-enduring noble Odysseus now gave a fearsome shout,\nand gathered himself and swooped like some high-flying eagle;\nbut then Kronos’ son flung down a smoldering bolt, which landed\nright in front of the grey-eyed child of the mighty Father. At this\nshe, grey-eyed Athene, addressed Odysseus, saying:\n“Scion of Zeus, Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,\nhold back now, abandon the strife of leveling battle,\nor Kronos’ son, far-seeing Zeus, may get angry with you.”\nSo spoke Athene: he obeyed, and was happy. A sworn\ntreaty for time to come was now made between both sides\nby Pallas Athene, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus,\nlikening herself to Mentor, in both voice and appearance.\n",
