# Homer's Living Network: Tracing Character Relations Across English Odysseys

## Chapter: Translation as Transformation

### Research Design Step-by-Step

**This digital humanities research integrates three complementary approaches:**
* Computational analysis using data science and NLP techniques
* Cultural-historical contextualization through literary studies
* Translation theory to interpret linguistic and narrative shifts

## Project Plan

The objectives are described [here](research-question.md).

### 1. Data Collection

A detailed descrition of the data is [here](data.md)
#### The Corpus
* **What**: Comprehensive collection of significant English Odyssey translations (1615-2023)
* **Selection criteria**: Cultural impact, innovative approach, temporal distribution
* **Format**: Plain text files with consistent encoding and formatting
* **Sources**: Project Gutenberg, HathiTrust Digital Library, Oxford Text Archive, publisher-authorized digital editions

#### English Literature and Translations
* **What**: Metadata catalog of Homeric reception in English literature
* **Scope**: Translations, adaptations, and significant allusions from Middle Ages to present
* **Variables**: Translator demographics, publication context, translation approach, critical reception
* **Purpose**: Establishing contextual framework for network analysis

#### Translations at a Glance
* **What**: Comparative metrics database of textual features across translations
* **Features**: Core character epithets, speech patterns, narrative emphasis, stylistic markers
* **Format**: Structured database enabling efficient cross-translation comparison
* **Goal**: Identifying patterns of character representation across temporal periods

### 2. Preprocessing

#### Clean and Normalize
* Remove paratextual elements (introductions, footnotes, page numbers)
* Standardize spelling and punctuation conventions
* Normalize character names and references across translations
* Resolve OCR errors and inconsistencies in digitized texts

#### Structure and Tag
* Implement TEI-inspired lightweight XML tagging system
  - `<book>` divisions with consistent numbering
  - `<speaker>` tags with standardized character IDs
  - `<epithet>` markers with character attribution
  - `<place>` tags for geographical references
  - `<interaction>` tags to capture character relationships
* Develop automated tagging pipeline with manual verification
* Create alignment markers to enable cross-translation parallel analysis

#### Entity Resolution
* Develop character identity resolution system
  - Map variant names to canonical identifiers
  - Resolve pronouns and indirect references
  - Track disguises and transformations (especially for Athena/Odysseus)
* Create character attribute database (divine/mortal, gender, status)
* Establish relationship taxonomy (kinship, guest-host, antagonistic)

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Lexical Analysis
* Type-Token Ratio (TTR) calculation by translation, book, and character speech
* Zipf Distribution Analysis to compare vocabulary richness
* TF-IDF Vectorization to identify characteristic vocabulary by translation
* Distinctive collocation patterns in character representations
* Diachronic vocabulary shift analysis

#### Visualization Suite
* Character presence heatmaps across books/translations
* Word clouds of epithets by character and translation period
* Principal Component Analysis of translation lexical features
* Temporal evolution of key Homeric concepts (xenia, kleos, nostos)
* Speech attribution proportions by character across translations

#### Network Preliminaries
* Character co-occurrence matrices
* Interaction frequency tables
* Centrality measures by translation
* Community detection to identify character groupings
* Comparative network diagrams across translation periods

### 4. Network Analysis

#### Character Network Construction
* Define network parameters:
  - Nodes: Characters with attribute data
  - Edges: Interactions, mentions, relationships
  - Weights: Frequency and significance of connections
* Create directed multigraphs representing narrative relationships
* Develop temporal network models showing narrative progression

#### Comparative Network Metrics
* Calculate and compare centrality measures across translations:
  - Degree centrality (character prominence)
  - Betweenness centrality (narrative bridging)
  - Eigenvector centrality (connection to important characters)
* Analyze community structures and character clustering
* Trace changes in character importance across translation history

#### Diachronic Network Evolution
* Periodization analysis (Renaissance, Romantic, Victorian, Modern, Contemporary)
* Gender-based network analysis to track changing representation
* Divine/mortal interaction patterns across translation eras
* Character agency metrics based on network position and speech attribution

### 5. Cultural-Historical Contextualization

#### Translation in Context
* Correlate network shifts with historical-cultural movements
* Analyze translator backgrounds and theoretical approaches
* Map network changes to literary movements and gender politics
* Connect translation choices to contemporaneous classical scholarship

#### Reception Analysis
* Examine paratextual framing of character relationships
* Analyze critical reception focusing on character representation
* Trace influence patterns between translations
* Identify innovations and conservative tendencies in network representation

### 6. Synthesis and Conclusions

#### Pattern Recognition
* Identify persistent vs. variable network features across translation history
* Determine significant correlations between network metrics and cultural factors
* Develop typology of translation approaches to Homeric character networks
* Map trajectories of key character relationships through translation history

#### Theoretical Implications
* Articulate how network analysis enhances translation studies
* Develop model for computational comparative translation analysis
* Propose framework for understanding cultural evolution through network transformation
* Outline methodological advances for digital classical reception studies
