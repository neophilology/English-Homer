## 🧠 Theoretical Framework

### 🔄 Translation as Negotiated Space 
Translation creates a dynamic intermediary space where source language (SL) and target language (TL) conventions interact. This negotiation encompasses linguistic expectations, cultural conformity, and the translator's embodied interpretation of the text ([Robinson, 2016](#references)). 

This "sway" can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively.

### 🔁 Translation as Transformative Rewriting
Each translation constitutes a creative reinterpretation that actively shapes literary canon formation through selective emphasis and cultural repositioning ([Lefevere, 1992, 1996](#references)).

### 📚 Corpus Distinctiveness
The corpus of 80+ complete English translations of the Odyssey spanning four centuries presents systematic linguistic patterns and cultural characteristics reflecting the target audience's evolution.

### 🕸️ Intertextual Influence Networks
The Odyssey has been incorporated into the English literary canon. New translations demonstrate measurable influence from prior Odysseys, creating complex networks of intertextual relationships where the target language performs simultaneously as the source culture.

## 📊 Specific Research Questions

1. **What quantifiable linguistic patterns** characterize the historical sway between Homeric Greek and English across the translation chronology?

2. **How do quantitative textual markers** reveal the progressive naturalization of the Odyssey within English literary traditions?

3. **To what extent can we identify and measure translator agency** within the constraints of cultural conformity?

4. **What statistical models best capture the evolution** of lexical, syntactic, and stylistic features across the corpus of translations?

## 📈 Expected Results

### Measurable and significant patterns including:

* **Correlations** between time and linguistic features (average sentence length, readability scores, lexical diversity, active-passive voice ratio)

* **Regression models** testing whether historical periods can predict linguistic features, style choices, or thematic emphasis

* **Cluster analysis** grouping translations based on shared stylistic or thematic traits, revealing potential translational trends across time periods

* **Network evolution** showing how character relationships and importance shift across translation eras
