#### Research questions
How does variation emerge over the four centuries-long span of English translations of Homer’s Odyssey?
Translation as Negotiated Space The translation process creates a dynamic intermediary space where source language (SL) and target language (TL) conventions interact. This negotiation encompasses linguistic expectations, cultural conformity, and the translator's embodied interpretation of the text (Robinson, 2016). This negotiation, or “sway,” assumes an influence in kind and degree, and it can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.
Translation as Transformative Rewriting Each translation constitutes a creative reinterpretation that actively shapes literary canon formation through selective emphasis and cultural repositioning (Lefevere, 1992, 1996).
Corpus Distinctiveness The corpus of over 80 complete English translations of the Odyssey spanning four centuries presents systematic linguistic adequacies and cultural characteristics of the target audience.
Intertextual Influence Networks The Odyssey has been incorporated into the English literary canon. Thus, new translations demonstrate a measurable influence from prior Odysseys, creating complex networks of intertextual relationships in which the target language can perform simultaneously as the source culture.
What quantifiable linguistic patterns characterize the historical sway between Homeric Greek and English across the translation chronology? 
How do quantitative textual markers reveal the progressive naturalization of the Odyssey within English literary traditions, demonstrating the target language can perform simultaneously as the source culture? 
To what extent can we identify and measure translator agency within the constraints of cultural conformity?
What statistical models best capture the evolution of lexical, syntactic, and stylistic features across the corpus of translations, revealing both diachronic trends and individual translator innovations?


Result(s) to replicate
Measurable and significant patterns and variations across translations like
Pearson’s correlation between time and lexical and stylistic features (average sentence length, readability scores, lexical diversity, active-passive voice ratio).
Regression models for testing whether historical periods can predict linguistic features, style choices, or thematic emphasis in translations.
Cluster analysis to group translations based on shared stylistic or thematic traits, revealing potential translational trends across time periods.
